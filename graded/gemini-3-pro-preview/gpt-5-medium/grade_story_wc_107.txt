<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Arlen is a consistent, distinct focalizer with a clear objective, but his journey lacks internal friction. He overcomes his "old fear" via summary rather than a dramatized pressure point, making him feel more like a vehicle for the theme than a character making difficult choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from entry to preparation, establishing a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. However, the progression is linear and low-stakes; the "cost" is limited to physical exertion ("arms shook") rather than a difficult trade-off or risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmospheric detailing is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid imagery like "melting in lace patterns" and "pipette ghosts." The environment actively participates in the mood, though the "snow science" line blurs the concrete with the abstract a bit too loosely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; Arlen faces no significant opposition from the cold, the glass, or his own limitations, succeeding in every task with smooth competence. The escalation is purely procedural, lacking a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility to test his resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of "science and tenderness" is coherent but heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements like "safeness is not a wall." The ending explicitly sermonizes ("purpose is to notice what hurts"), which flattens the subtext into a moral lesson rather than earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical and whimsical tone consistent with the protagonist's "thoughtfully spirited" nature. While the "narrating mundane tasks" device borders on repetitive, it effectively establishes his specific way of interacting with the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose creates a lush texture but suffers from overwrought metaphors that obscure clarity (e.g., "sound like paper being forgiven," "melt sand and snow science"). "Gout orange" reads as a usage error or a jarringly obscure image that distracts from the visual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a glassblower reclaiming an abandoned scientific control room is imaginative and fresh. The specific synthesis of "inquiry" and "warmth" avoids standard post-apocalyptic tropes, offering a unique, if somewhat precious, vision.</comment>
