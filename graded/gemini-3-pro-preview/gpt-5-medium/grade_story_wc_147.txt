<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific expertise and mythic voice are compelling, creating a distinct "science-fantasy" persona. However, the reliance on "instinct" to resolve the central internal crisis (panic) feels like a mechanical toggle rather than a deeply felt psychological choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, successfully blending technical mission steps with dream-logic physics. Closure is solid, with the successful signal altering the status quo, though the physical "tug" of the reply feels slightly convenient given the acoustic premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "cathedral of pressure" and "patient eyes" of anemones create a vivid, constraining environment. The specific acoustic properties of the setting actively dictate the protagonist's tactics and pacing, satisfying the high-band requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (crew survival, dwindling air) and pressure escalates appropriately through the environment. The resolution of the panic beat, however, is dampened by the repetitive use of the "instinct" phrase, which simplifies the struggle into a momentary reset rather than an escalating complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of technology, memory, and sound creates a rich subtext about communication across distances. The perfume vial serving as a "mathematics of need" is a resonant thematic image that lands well without feeling overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately somber for the setting. The control of psychic distance is strong, moving effectively from the expanse of the trench to the intimacy of the mask and vial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery is generally dense and effective ("silt swallows my lamp into a bruise"), but the verbatim repetition of "overriding instinct" in two separate beats disrupts the prose rhythm and reads as a visible prompt artifact. "Panic paddles my ribs" leans slightly into overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of an acoustic underwater temple used for distress signals via scent/memory is genuinely fresh. The story successfully creates a unique "science-fantasy" logic that feels consistent within its own boundaries.</comment>
