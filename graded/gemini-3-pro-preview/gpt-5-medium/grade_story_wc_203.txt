<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and competent, but the internal conflict ("lines where duty and curiosity pulled different ways") is stated rather than dramatized; the decision to release the ghosts feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The self-description "I am skillfully observant" is a "tell" that undermines the immersive authority of the voice, diagnosing a trait rather than trusting the reader to infer it from the action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, linear investigation with clear orientation and a distinct closure unit (winding the spring backward). The logic of the resolution—treating a mechanical spring as a metaphysical bank—operates successfully on a fairy-tale level, though the causality is more poetic than strict. The cost is conceptual ("stories that spend themselves") rather than visibly paid on the page by the narrator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the focus on the "ceiling grid" as a layer of secrets provides a fresh, specific perspective that integrates well with the protagonist's skill set. Sensory details like "mouse nests," "gun oil," and the "peeled knuckle" simile create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that grounds the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent but relatively low-stakes; the conflict is an external puzzle (solving the ghosts' trap) rather than a personal crucible with immediate danger or difficult trade-offs. The "weightless burden" is felt, but the protagonist faces no active opposition, making the climax a procedural execution of a solution rather than a tense confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of time as currency and labor debt is well-integrated into the central prop and the resolution ("paid in hours instead of dollars"). The final image of the smile no longer flaking offers a resonant, non-literal confirmation of the change, effectively reweighting the "cracks in the facade" motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The noir-inflected voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending technical jargon with lyrical observation. However, the narration occasionally slips into self-congratulatory exposition ("I am skillfully observant") or over-reliance on stylized declarative statements ("Dust is how I read a room") that feel slightly performed rather than natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and high-effort, often evocative ("hush slid down... like silk"), but suffers from occasional mixed metaphors (a ledger lying "like a moth" yet described as "heavy" contradicts the vehicle). The repetition of the phrase regarding the "fluorescent buzz" works as a structural anchor, but some descriptions border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of an elevator technician specializing in ceiling ghosts is a fresh, specific synthesis that revitalizes the "ghost hunter" trope. While the "time as currency" concept is a known literary trope, anchoring it in the mechanics of a watch mainspring within a circus ticket booth provides enough material specificity to feel original.</comment>
