<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's "frugality" operates as a distinct worldview rather than just a trait, grounding the voice and motivation. The internal conflict—empirical maintenance versus the "palace of myths"—is resolved through a quiet but costly vow (spending "hours" and "oil") that feels entirely earned by the character's established values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is clean and linear; the discovery of the tile logically leads to the mapping, the alignment, and the final choice. The closure (signing the covenant) acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, solidifying the protagonist's role with legible cost. Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the drain, bronze pins, wires, and alcove are tools that constrain action and enable the solution. The specific sensory details (plaster falling like "gray feathers," the smell of "pepper and rain") create a lived-in, tactile atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily internal and conceptual—maintenance against entropy—but are felt through the "currency" of attention and oil. The pressure escalates through the puzzle-solving process, culminating in a choice that forecloses other paths (power/grandeur) in favor of stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "attention is a currency" creates a powerful through-line that elevates the narrative above a simple puzzle story. The ending resonates deeply, reframing the protagonist's "thrift" as a form of piety without becoming moralistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptionally consistent, blending the precise vocabulary of an astronomer with a lyrical, contemplative tone. The "perceptual signature" is strong; the narrator notices angles, sums, and costs in a way specific to their character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong verbs ("clung," "pried," "buckled"). A slight density of similes in the middle section ("like a dried river," "like violet silk," "like a penitent") momentarily threatens the otherwise frugal voice, but the imagery remains vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a "frugal astronomer" treating a magical discovery as a maintenance task—is a fresh, specific subversion of fantasy tropes. The synthesis of Babylonian aesthetics with mathematical devotion creates a unique and memorable atmosphere.</comment>
