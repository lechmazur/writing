<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's "blessed pariah" duality creates immediate, complex interiority that informs every choice. The internal conflict is embodied well, though the transition from guilt to the final "devotion" feels slightly smoothed over by the reflective distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, using the ritual to build pressure toward a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end. The redefinition of the compass rose provides a satisfying, textually earned closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "time dilation" is not just chrome; it actively constrains the sketching process and shapes the central metaphor. The distortion of the stars serves as an effective, functional micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized, with the struggle to "fix the world to a single point" providing adequate pressure. However, the physical stakes remain somewhat abstract, relying heavily on the interpretation of the headache and the drawing rather than tangible external resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of navigating guilt through memory is resonant, but the explicit moralizing ("We will not fear the dark we carry") in the final third feels like an unearned thesis statement that briefly flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The meditative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the solitary atmosphere perfectly. The "pariah" perspective colors the observation of the city effectively, maintaining a cohesive perceptual signature throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While mechanically clean, the prose suffers from a high-density "simile loop" artifact ("like a cathedral," "like a lighter god," "like a tide," "like petals," "like a patient animal"). This template cadence creates a droning rhythm that distances the reader during peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi time-dilation mechanic with a grounded, tactile grief ritual is fresh and effective. The move from spatial navigation to temporal mapping offers a genuine specific insight.</comment>
