<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's professional competence merges seamlessly with personal grief, grounding abstract magical stakes in a concrete emotional cost (giving up the perfect eternity for a survivable moment). The internal conflict drives the external resolution perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality is tight; the magic system's rules (imperfection = buoyancy) are taught early and dictate the climax. The closure (printing the asymmetrical moment) logically resolves the crisis with a legible price and creates a distinct "after" state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard is realized with exceptional sensory specificity ("fruit-books," "veined with filaments"). The setting is not static; it reacts to the plot (creaking, rising sea) and strictly constrains the protagonist's options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly from the frost's temptation to the physical rupture of the library. The choice is a clear trade-off: perfection (sinking) vs. wobble (survival), dramatized vividly through the printing press mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "survivable asymmetry" is sophisticated and earned. The score is capped by the explicit articulation of the moral in the final paragraph ("all awakenings must rustle"), which leans on telling the thesis rather than letting the resonant image stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, melancholic, and authoritative, perfectly suiting a "cryptic letterpress operator." The lyricism serves the atmosphere without obscuring the mechanical actions, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("tide unsettles a mirror," "braille frost") with excellent rhythmic control. The imagery is strictly consistent with the glass/liquid motif, avoiding mixed metaphors even at high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating library, letterpress magic, and "negotiable reality" feels fresh and specific. The concept of printing "wobble" to maintain buoyancy is a unique, non-obvious angle on the order/chaos trope.</comment>
