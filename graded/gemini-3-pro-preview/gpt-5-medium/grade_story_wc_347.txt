<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's resignation to duty creates a solid, albeit somewhat static, emotional baseline. While the "reluctant caretaker" role is fulfilled, the internal cost of staying feels more narrated ("duty had settled like a thorned halo") than dramatized through a hesitant micro-choice in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as Earned Stasis; the family escapes while the narrator remains trapped by the bargain. The narrative arc is clear and causal, though the resolution via the nut ("Seeds remember the first door") leans heavily on poetic logic rather than established mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active, with the "shifting geometry" and "mechanical birds" exerting tangible pressure on the characters. Specific details like "lichen map burned faintly" and "wooden bones" of the apples ground the fantastical elements well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation is functional, driven by the ticking clock of the frost and the patrol change. The stakes are clear, but the "forgotten blueprint" technique reduces the friction of the escape, making the external opposition feel slightly managed rather than desperate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory rewriting reality ("rewritten hourly by wind") is compelling and integrates well with the plot. The final resonance is strong, though the explicit naming of the tone ("graceless and beautiful") in the last line feels slightly redundant given the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical detachment that suits the magical realism. The shift to "numbers lived in my throat" effectively characterizes the narrator's specific perception, maintaining distance control throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality and dense ("folded like a fist opening"), but occasionally slips into overwrought personification ("peaches rehearse seduction") that calls attention to itself. The label-telling ("offhandedly exact") weakens the immediate impact of the characterization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical threats and organic curses creates a distinct atmosphere. While the "magic seed opens door" trope is familiar, the "walking without touching" mechanic adds a fresh, specific layer to the navigation.</comment>
