<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's specific expertise as a translator defines their perception and tactical choices, creating a unique internal landscape. The shift from "haunted ambitions" to accepting a role as a "comma" represents an earned, character-specific resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the external repair of the arbor perfectly mirrors the internal settling of ambition. The "grammar" magic system functions with rigorous consistency, paying off the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific properties of the magnetic arbor (filings, conducting rails) constrain the protagonist's actions and enable the solution. The environment is active, responding to voice and seed with tangible mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pressure is quiet but coherent, escalating from routine maintenance to a critical intervention to prevent the arbor's collapse. The "haunted ambitions" provide necessary internal friction that sharpens the stakes of the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transition is explored with nuance, refusing a simple solution in favor of "sharing" the burden. The final image of the seed rooting in iron filings offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief and physics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident and idiosyncratic, successfully sustaining the extended metaphor of world-as-sentence without breaking immersion. The lyrical precision matches the character's "methodical" nature perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, using the "touching distance" refrain to great effect. While the metaphor-as-fact structures are frequent, they serve the "analogical thinking" concept rather than reading as affectation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform linguistics and electromagnetic physics is highly original and executed with conviction. The concept of "analogical thinking" as a functional mechanic is a fresh, non-obvious take on magic/science.</comment>
