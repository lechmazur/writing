<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is more a vessel for the concept than a living person; their "vow" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance or cost. While the "sensitively perceptive" trait drives action, the internal conflict (shirk vs. map) is resolved too easily, lacking the contradictory impulses required for higher marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for this dream-logic narrative, leading to a legible moment of closure ("Earned Stasis") where the burden is accepted. The "hopscotch" sequence provides a surreal but coherent causal bridge between the negative and the letter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "drowned district" is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("ribcages of towers," "fireplace black as kelp"). The setting actively pressures the protagonist's senses, though at times the metaphor density threatens to obscure the physical geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Escalation is present but low-voltage; the stakes are largely abstract ("legacy's burden") and the opposition is theoretical. While the sequence of discovery moves the plot, the protagonist's choice to accept the weight feels inevitable rather than a hard-won victory over genuine temptation to flee.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of legacy and guilt is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; phrases like "legacy's burden breathed there" and "mentors... had not charted guilt" turn subtext into text. The story explains its own meaning rather than letting the resonant images speak for themselves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the "cartographer of echoes" persona. The "perceptual signature" is strong, though the relentless poetic register sometimes creates a distance that prevents raw emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor fatigue; nearly every noun is modified by a figure of speech ("latch clucking," "salt grammar," "refugees in borrowed coats"). This relentless density slows momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of "echo cartography" is fresh and imaginative, offering a unique lens on the familiar "post-climate ruins" trope. The specific mechanism of playing a childhood game to unlock a room's memory adds a layer of inventive magical realism.</comment>
