<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist has distinct, quirky traits ("philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms") and a clear internal state. However, the transformation from bewildered to resolute relies heavily on the magical mechanics of the fruit rather than a deeply pressured emotional struggle, making the arc feel slightly accelerated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causality is consistent within the dream-logic of the setting, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively with the "curator of the between" realization. The cost is paid via the cameo, creating a legible before/after state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and inventive, blending the cosmic ("lonely asteroid") with the mundane ("bathroom pods") seamlessly. Specific sensory details like the "smell of tap water" from the star-plum ground the surrealism excellently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but the external pressure remains low; the "hazard" of the orchard is navigated with relative ease via the aunt's guidance. The climax is a moment of discovery and exchange rather than high-tension conflict, fitting the tone but limiting escalation intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "nonlinear inheritance" is woven beautifully into the plot mechanics (fruit, cameo, aunt's archive). The concept of being "written as we read" provides a satisfying, resonant thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the magical realist tone ("objects could be hungry"). The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining the "bewildered" perspective while delivering precise imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("scalped smooth by time," "pit clicked against his teeth"). There are no significant loops or artifacts, and the rhythm supports the story's dream-like quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic orchard with mundane bathroom epiphanies creates a fresh, distinct aesthetic. The concept of the "ledger" as a physical space is handled with imaginative specificity.</comment>
