<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's "forgiving skeptic" persona provides a distinct, consistent internal filter that colors every observation. Motivation is clear and ethical; the choice to "tell it plain" aligns perfectly with the bone-setter's trade of painful correction. Ari’s guilt is embodied in his physical posture, creating a strong psychosomatic link between character and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, moving from the discovery of the substitute body to the garden investigation and final confrontation. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to reject the "witch tale" for the truth comes with the felt cost of the impending town clamor. The narrative logic holds the magical realism together without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and metaphorical; the hedge maze and secret garden are not just backdrops but externalizations of Ari's hidden guilt. The fountain and the "mint and iron" smell create a vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere. The final image of the stars charging the "bones of the sky" beautifully integrates the environment with the central healing metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: the comfort of a false resolution versus the pain of the truth. Pressure escalates from the physical evidence (the tooth) to the living reality of Ari. The conflict is resolved through a physical act (bone setting) that mirrors the narrative choice, though the external antagonism (the town) remains a looming, rather than immediate, threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "setting" things right—whether bones or stories—is woven masterfully through the narrative. The motif of turning mistakes into constellations offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of guilt. The story avoids preachy moralizing by grounding the theme in the specific physical labor of the narrator.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and highly specific to the narrator's trade ("set more wrists than clocks"). Narrative distance is controlled, maintaining an intimate but observant perspective. The poetic density is high but consistent with the "forgiving skeptic" persona established in the opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high information density. However, the metaphor density is occasionally overwhelming (e.g., "clue humming at a pitch of childhood," "fountain muttered in a dialect of abandoned plans"), bordering on pathetic fallacy that slightly distances the reader from the immediate physical scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of forensic mystery, bone-setting mechanics, and fae folklore feels fresh and specific. The concept of mapping a maze by its mistakes ("constellations") is an ingenious detail that elevates the standard "hidden garden" trope into something emotionally specific.</comment>
