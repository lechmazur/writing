<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is rich and the voice is distinct, blending professional duty with deep empathy. However, the specific ability to read narrative history from dust patterns borders on magical realism, which creates a slight tonal friction with the otherwise grounded setting. The subject (Micah) feels idealized rather than complex, serving more as a vessel for the theme than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from discovery to closure via a Decisive Change (updating the file). However, the causal logic strains credibility when the protagonist deduces the specific identity and timeline of the previous visitor ("counselor... returned last week") solely from dust. This leap feels more convenient than earned, weakening the investigative chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and tactile; the "hospital of paper" and the specific qualities of the dust are not just atmospheric but instrumental to the plot. The environment constrains and enables the protagonist's unique method of discovery. The sensory details (talc-gray air, flickering fluorescents) effectively charge the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), which fits the quiet tone but lacks immediate external pressure or risk. The investigation proceeds without obstacles—the clues are found and interpreted easily. A stronger sense of resistance or a higher cost for the "addendum" would have elevated the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving dignity in the face of bureaucratic erasure is poignant and clearly developed. While the story risks sentimentality with the "perfect" orphan narrative, the focus on "quiet requests" and "magnifying small kindnesses" provides a cohesive emotional core. The ending successfully resonates with the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and confident, effectively establishing the "broken-hearted" persona through rhythm and diction. The prose matches the fragility of the subject matter. The shift from observation to action is handled well within the established POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("exhaling a grit of rooms"). There is a slight over-reliance on the word "unfurl" (appearing three times), but the metaphorical consistency holds. The line-level craft supports the story's atmospheric weight without dragging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Using dust patterns as a forensic tool for empathy is a fresh and imaginative mechanism that elevates a familiar "forgotten orphan" trope. The execution feels novel, though the underlying emotional beats are somewhat traditional. It balances invention with emotional accessibility well.</comment>
