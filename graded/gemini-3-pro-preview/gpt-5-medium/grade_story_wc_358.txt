<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s professional ethos is compelling, grounding the investigation in a clear internal philosophy ("foresight is not vision but practiced posture"). However, the interaction with the child relies on a functional "adult economy" trope, and the mid-crisis lecture on vectors feels slightly staged, reducing naturalism in the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is impeccable; the investigation of the past crash directly provides the data needed to solve the present crisis. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the survey tools and the "borrowed authority" of the patch are successfully tested against the wind, fulfilling the 9+ gate for constraint-driven resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary antagonist; the arrangement of the shipping containers ("canyons") creates the specific wind shear that drives the plot. This integration of geography and physics is masterfully handled, ensuring the environment constrains every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a theoretical investigation to a life-or-death intervention. The tension is well-managed, though the momentary pause to explain the philosophy of vectors to the child slightly drags on the urgency of the incoming medical flight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of foresight versus reaction is woven tightly into the action, moving beyond abstract musing to practical application. The concept of "singular convergence" is effectively dramatized, though the internal monologue occasionally leans into heavy-handed aphorism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "hazy precision" that blends technical observation with lyrical insight. The perceptual signature is consistent, viewing the world through the lens of accidents and vectors without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring ("mothball sweetness," "slow animal breathing"). A few metaphors verge on overwrought ("wind learned a new trick"), but the rhythm and line-level propulsion are largely excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of an investigator using a quiet moment to prepare for an inevitable noise is fresh and engaging. The combination of the "silent town" mystery with hard-nosed accident reconstruction creates a unique narrative space.</comment>
