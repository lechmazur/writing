<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific background as a "coral bleaching witness" effectively grounds their observational skills, translating well into the rhythm-based solution. Interiority is distinct and reflective, though the transition from observer to community savior relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized interpersonal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure moves fluidly from investigation to resolution, but the climax (the village crossing) is handled in summary rather than a high-pressure scene. The "Assemble" key functioning as both a console command and a thematic directive is a clever if slightly convenient pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's standout feature; the "wet shiver-sand" and the station acting as a "patient metronome" create a tactile, immersive world. The setting actively constrains the characters and defines the mechanism of the plot, fully justifying the high score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the stakes (drowning) are high, the conflict remains largely intellectual and atmospheric. The resolution comes relatively easily through intuition and cooperation, lacking a sharp moment of "near-miss" or visceral cost during the climax to heighten the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation—shifting from rigid maps to living rhythms—is beautifully integrated and lands a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the spine/lanterns powerfully reframes the keeper's role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the rhythmic motif of the story. The narrative distance is appropriate for a keeper's log, maintaining a "drifting moored" quality that suits the protagonist's isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with evocative phrasing ("patient as kelp," "arithmetic left to us"). However, the repetition of prompt-specific phrases like "periodically eternal" and "drifting moored" creates a slight echo that draws attention to the prompt constraints.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate post-apocalypse with a rhythmic/auditory magic system is fresh and engaging. The interpretation of the "atlas page" as a musical score rather than a map offers a genuinely ingenious turn.</comment>
