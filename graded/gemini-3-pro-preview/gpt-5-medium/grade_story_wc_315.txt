<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's history with the pilot (the scar) effectively raises the stakes beyond the immediate task, creating a tangible "relationship as crucible." However, the interiority relies too heavily on self-diagnostic labeling ("preserve trust under pressure") rather than letting the tension speak for itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structural arc is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a distinct climax where the watcher's action aids the ship. The closure lands well with a "Charged Poise" reconciliation, though the mechanics of the rope interaction could be established more concretely earlier to maximize the causal payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vertical environment and atmospheric pressures ("clouds whirlpool strangely," "heating like a fist") actively constrain the characters' choices. While vivid, the personification in lines like "stars from feeling shy" feels slightly precious against the gritty danger of the landing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent, moving from environmental warning to mechanical crisis ("blister of air"). The conflict is resolved primarily through competence, which is satisfying, though a sharper sense of active trade-off or cost during the "lean" would heighten the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The themes of duty and trauma are present, but the narrative tends to state them explicitly ("the watcher's burden is...") rather than allowing them to emerge solely from subtext. The silent nod at the end carries more thematic weight than the narrated exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyrical, meditative voice is consistent and builds a distinct texture. However, the register occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("creaks in long vowels") that distances the reader slightly from the visceral immediacy of the crash risk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from some repetitive phrasing ("remembering through muscle memory" appears twice in full) and occasional overwriting ("pondwater," "soap bubbles") that softens the tension. The rhythm generally supports the action well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The arboreal setting combined with the glider logistics creates a fresh, specific world. While the "scarred partner" dynamic is a familiar trope, the physical execution of the landing ritual gives it a unique, tactile grounding.</comment>
