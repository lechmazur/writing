<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lark is competent and the backstory grounds her skills ("read like tide tables"), but her core motivation ("collecting human weather") remains abstract and aesthetic, lacking visceral urgency. Her emotional distance keeps the stakes theoretical, as she operates more as a catalytic observer than a vulnerable participant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the "truce of hush" provides excellent structural constraint that shapes the scene's tension. However, the climax relies on the coincidental timing of the cutpurse’s interference to trigger the lime spill, rather than the protagonist’s psychological manipulation forcing the break directly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, anchoring the scene in "salt and rot" and the "breath of limes" while using the silence to amplify minute sounds. The setting actively pressures the characters, enforcing the non-verbal communication that drives the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent under the Situational lens, but the protagonist functions largely as a manipulator with minimal personal risk. The felt cost of the climax falls entirely on secondary characters (the smuggler’s dignity), leaving Lark's agency high but her personal stakes low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of fragile trust is integrated well through the "hush" constraint and the final recording. The ending reflection ("return whenever trust is about to change shape") feels slightly imposed and grandiloquent compared to the concrete action that preceded it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively translating the silent market's tension into text. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the environment through Lark's specific, collector-focused lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled ("brittle inhale like glass deciding to be sand"), creating a strong atmospheric texture. While occasional metaphors feel slightly overwritten ("nerves braided with lantern light"), information density and sensory precision are consistently high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a sound collector manipulating a silent pirate market is a fresh, creative synthesis of elements. The execution avoids standard heist tropes in favor of a more unique, atmospheric tension.</comment>
