<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sorin's internal conflict regarding artistic theft is well-drawn, and the shift from "script and adorn" to listening creates a legible arc. However, the character sometimes functions as a mouthpiece for the theme ("hands felt suddenly like tools for theft") rather than an embodied presence, and the "urbane" trait is stated more than dramatized in interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a significant coincidence—the woman entering the dome just as Sorin resolves to change methods—which undercuts causal earning. Additionally, the ending dissolves into summary ("On opening night"), replacing dramatized scenic struggle with a narrated account of success, which blunts the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is utilized excellently, with the "echoing floor" and "ribs of the scaffolding" integrating the physical space with the thematic needs of the scene. The sensory details ("cables and moths," "puddle of moon") ground the abstract ethical debate in a concrete, atmospheric reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of ethical integrity are clearly established ("pickpockets of grief"), providing strong initial pressure. However, the tension dissipates in the final act because the success of the new method is summarized rather than tested in a granular, high-stakes moment on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The exploration of ethical storytelling is coherent but heavily articulated through explicit interior monologue ("ask whom our applause pressed into the floor"). The theme feels imposed as a manifesto rather than emerging organically from subtext, reducing interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a polished, slightly elevated register ("purling," "adorn") that fits the calligrapher persona. The perspective remains stable, filtering the world consistently through Sorin's specific artistic sensibilities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally strains for poetic effect with mixed or obscure metaphors ("smoke that forgot its fire," "hush purling"). These moments of overwriting slightly obscure the clarity of the image, though the general flow remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a decommissioned radar dome, a campfire tradition, and subversive puppetry creates a fresh and memorable aesthetic. While the structural execution leans on summary, the core creative concept is inventive and non-obvious.</comment>
