<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent professional whose motivation and agency are clear, driving the procedural arc. However, internal conflict is minimal—limited to a moment of "pretended confidence"—and the character lacks a distinct personal flaw or contradictory impulse that would heighten the emotional stakes beyond mere endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear structure with a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure ("they learn where to be quiet"). While the arc is solid and the orientation clear, the resolution feels smooth; the protagonist succeeds through skill without facing a pivotal moment of doubt or failure that would earn a higher causality score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with sensory details like "throats of rock" and "hieroglyphs of pressure" actively constraining the protagonist's method. The environment is not just a backdrop but a physical force that dictates the pacing and tactics of the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Pressure builds adequately through sensory escalation ("ribs clatter"), but the conflict is resolved via a competence-based success rather than a hard choice or sacrifice. The cost is strictly physical endurance, lacking the visceral or relational price required to push the stakes into higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of accommodation over conquest resonates well, anchored by the final image of the map holding the "hinge." The subtext of finding silence within noise is woven through the imagery, delivering a resonant conclusion without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the "harmonic" nature of the setting with a distinct perceptual signature. The rhythmic prose supports the pacing, though the register remains static, lacking variation between the procedural and emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("blue to the tongue"), though it leans on synesthetic abstraction. A notable artifact is the repetition of the prompt phrase "gently luminous" for both the beings and the stone, which reads as a lexical loop rather than a deliberate echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a sonic mapkeeper is fresh, and the "bloom of hush" is an imaginative solution. While the "energy beings" trope is standard, the specific execution through acoustic geology and ice-reading adds a layer of distinct ingenuity.</comment>
