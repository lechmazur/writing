<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is strong, anchored by the compulsive heartbeat counting which effectively dramatizes the protagonist's trauma. The "death certificate error" provides a unique entry point, though it functions more as a label than a driver of tactical choices in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is cohesive, moving cleanly from the ink ritual to the confrontation and recalibration. Closure is distinct and earned, with the restored archive and the "wiser kind of dark" providing a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's guilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "opal observatory" and "porcelain shard" functioning as essential grounding elements. The shard, in particular, acts as a micro-setting that constrains focus and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and high, driven by the pressure of the "false aurora" mistake. The resolution relies on a somewhat standard technical fix ("recalibrate," "defragment"), but the emotional cost and the "staccato" physical pressure validate the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of humility in the face of the cosmos is compelling, but the mentor's dialogue ("You did not doom the sky...") explicitly states the moral. This thematic echo in the climax flattens the subtext and triggers a penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, maintaining a strong specific texture. However, the high register occasionally creates distance, prioritizing poetic phrasing over immediate connection during the ghost's confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically assured but overly dense with figurative language ("ink trembles as if struck by an unseen bell," "cartography of regret"). This relentless metaphor stacking in high-pressure beats obscures the literal action and slows narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of analogue divination (ink, shard) with digital restoration creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. While the "mentor ghost" is a familiar trope, the "death certificate" angle and the atmospheric execution offer a unique synthesis.</comment>
