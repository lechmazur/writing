<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrator is introspective and voice-driven but lacks dramatized internal contradiction or struggle; the competence displayed conflicts with the negligence of ignoring the dead lamp. The "keeper" persona feels idealized and static, serving as a vessel for poetic observation rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The emotional arc is told through abstract summaries ("luminescent ache") rather than embodied reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>A major causal disconnect undermines the narrative: the lamp failing mid-storm implies an immediate crisis for a lighthouse keeper (shipwrecks), yet the protagonist ignores this to light a candle and exchange letters. This lack of urgency drains the inciting incident of consequence, turning a life-or-death scenario into a low-stakes backdrop for reflection. The closure is thematic rather than a result of the protagonist's actions tackling the established problem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with a consistent, haunting mood established through sensory details like the "cough of waves" and "green as a harbor light." However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally creates a "postcard" effect where the setting feels static and ornamental rather than a pressure cooker for the scene's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretically high (a storm, a dead lamp, ghosts), but they are not operationalized in the scene; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The potential conflict of the light failing is sidelined for a peaceful exchange, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the pressure does not escalate. The ending relies on a philosophical realization rather than the cost of a hard choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of connection and safety is resonant but heavily sermonized, particularly in the final paragraph which explicitly states the moral ("If safety could be bottled..."). Instead of allowing the meaning to emerge organically from the action of the stones and letters, the text relies on diagnostic statements to ensure the reader understands the intended message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical but suffers from monochromatic uniformity; the skipper, the narrator, and even the letter writers (including a schoolchild) share the exact same poetic register. This lack of vocal differentiation flattens the world, making the supporting cast feel like ventriloquist dummies for the narrator's own style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from extreme simile saturation, with "like" or "as" constructions appearing nearly every few sentences ("like a tidepool," "like scripture," "like salt," "like a net"). This figurative clutter acts as a scaffold that distances the reader from the immediate action, prioritizing poetic ornament over clarity and momentum. The writing is polished but overwritten, slowing the pace significantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a lonely keeper finding connection via anonymous notes is a familiar romantic trope, and while the "stone code" adds a nice specific layer, the execution relies heavily on standard lyrical conventions. The lack of a fresh subversion or a grittier, more realistic response to the crisis keeps the story in a safe, traditional lane.</comment>
