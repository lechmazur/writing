<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal dedication to the craft drives the narrative, culminating in a significant sacrifice (the name) that feels earned. While the "copper-veined" trait remains largely ornamental, the "quietly articulate" attribute is effectively operationalized as a tactical approach to the canyon's acoustics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative builds coherent pressure through the translation attempts, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds well. However, the closure dissolves into a summarized montage ("Travelers learned...", "When storms came...") rather than ending on the high-cost beat of the name sacrifice, which dilutes the immediate impact of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active and integral; the echo tunnel and the specific acoustics of the canyon constrain choices and define the magic system. The sensory details ("stone ribs," "unread syllables") effectively translate the abstract concept into concrete constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as the loss of a language against the resistance of the environment. The escalation is steady, moving from technical failure (birds scattering) to personal cost (giving up the name), providing a clear "felt" price for success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "endings need caretakers" is poignant and organically developed through the plot. The commodification of language ("worn smooth by barter") adds depth to the central conflict without feeling preached.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately mythic, fitting the "storyteller" persona. It maintains a distinct texture, though at times the stylistic polish creates a slight distance from the raw emotion of the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, there is a high density of similes ("like patient rain," "like bark," "like dry ink," "like torn script") that creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm and draws attention to the writing over the scene. The "curse is a contract without punctuation" line feels slightly too aphoristic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bird flight, diamond fractures, and echoes to translate texture is a fresh and imaginative concept. The trope of sacrificing a name is executed with specific, grounded stakes that revitalize the familiar idea.</comment>
