<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc from avoidance to integration is clear, but the opening self-definition ("I am a wistful lantern broker") relies on telling rather than showing. While the emotional progression is sound, the interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic labeling ("hunger for meaning") rather than embodying the struggle in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is solid, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the vial transforms from a trap to a compass. While the coincidence of the mother's hidden UV script matching the greenhouse's inventory is slightly convenient, it functions effectively to force the closure within the short scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative, acting as both a physical constraint and a catalyst for the resolution. Sensory details like "crystal shadows" and "moisture beads" are vivid, and the greenhouse's specific contents (the extinct flower) directly charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates effectively through the dual anticipation of the flower's bloom and the opening of the vial. The internal cost—the painful confrontation with the "absent smell"—is legible and pays off the buildup, though the external stakes regarding the lantern delivery remain low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a current is resonant, but the protagonist explicitly articulates the thesis in dialogue ("I want to understand why...") and thought ("They are not visits from the past but currents..."). This Thematic Echo reduces the subtextual power of the ending by explaining the insight rather than letting it emerge solely from the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, well-suited to the atmospheric content. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("mouth of grief needed feeding"), and the explicit thematic summarization flattens the narrative distance at critical moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose is generally evocative, the final third suffers from distracting repetition artifacts. The word "patient" appears three times ("patient ink," "patient decay," "patient flame") and "disciplined" twice ("disciplined lightning," "disciplined bloom") in the resolution, creating an algorithmic cadence that undermines the emotional closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lantern broker, extinct botany, and ultraviolet forensics is imaginative and fresh. The premise offers a unique frame for exploring grief, though the "hidden ink revealed by light" element is a familiar trope that is elevated here by the specific setting.</comment>
