<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is deep and character-specific ("lid someone else screwed on"); the protagonist's redefinition of failure into attention is a fully earned arc that drives the story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure flows seamlessly from the climb to the return; the closure serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new, earned ritual with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details are visceral ("cold rang like a tiny bell"), and the setting's specific physics (accommodating impossibilities) directly enable the climax and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict between automated perfection and human messiness is escalated effectively; the cost is felt in the physical toll of the climb and the protagonist's social alienation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of valuing the unfinished is beautifully developed through imagery ("condolences") rather than exposition, landing a resonant emotional argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, but the abrupt, unmotivated shift from past tense to present at the climax ("began... I unstrap") breaks POV stability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("tongue finding a missing tooth"), though the mid-paragraph tense fracture at the pivotal moment marks a significant technical slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh, soulful synthesis of the mage archetype with a critique of commodification; the "caretaker of questions" resolution feels both inevitable and unique.</comment>
