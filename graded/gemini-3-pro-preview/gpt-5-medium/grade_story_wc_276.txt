<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's "cool-headed" nature is actively deconstructed ("calm is a net you mend every hour"), revealing internal effort. Motivation is clear and noble, driving the renunciation at the climax. The choice to release the map is earned by the established character trait of being a "listener" rather than a conqueror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic where acoustic physics and myth blend seamlessly. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the release of the spike/map restores the coast, a decisive action with clear conceptual cost (returning the prize to save the source).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of the "sound wave garden" concept. The setting physics (iron as tuning fork, tidepools as ears) actively constrain the protagonist's method and tools, directly shaping the climax. The environment is not just backdrop but the engine of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (the coast is being devoured by silence) and escalate as the protagonist moves deeper into the garden. The confrontation with the goddess forces a clear trade-off: possession of the echo versus the restoration of the land.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "hoarding vs. holding" is woven tightly into the action ("not hoard but hold in a way that keeps opening"). The ending resonates powerfully with this theme, offering a non-literal solution to the problem of entropy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, high-lyric register ("braided music," "ribs of the sea") without slipping. The sensory translation (synesthesia of sound and physical weight) remains controlled and immersive throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("constellations... swaying like lanternfish"). While the required phrase "transliterates emotions" feels slightly clinical against the poetic diction, it is integrated grammatically. Rhythm and momentum are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A strikingly original synthesis of acoustic science and mythology. The concept of "sleepwalking constellations" leaving footprints that are tidepools is inventive and visually specific. The story takes bold imaginative risks that pay off in a coherent magic system.</comment>
