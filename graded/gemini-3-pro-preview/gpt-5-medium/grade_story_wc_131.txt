<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's desire "to become visible to those who need you" is distinct and drives the narrative arc effectively. Interiority is lyrical and consistent, though occasionally bordering on twee ("heart big as a boiler"). The internal conflict between safety (invisibility) and connection is resolved through a meaningful compromise at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a clear change in the protagonist's stance (accepting visibility through traces), but the plot relies on a significant spatial coincidence: the mother's hiding spot is identical to the protagonist's personal cache. This convenience simplifies the search and lowers the earned causality of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric details ("sapphire hush," "dustlavender," "creak like old oaks") are vivid and effectively ground the magical elements. The sensory experience of the "crawl space" perspective is well-rendered, creating a distinct texture that supports the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stakes are relatively low and the pressure is gentle; the "outage" conveniently lowers the barrier for the magic to work rather than complicating the protagonist's task. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the obstacle (finding the book) is solved instantly by the tape revealing a location the protagonist already knows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of service as a form of presence is coherent and touching. However, the ending explicitly summarizes this theme ("To him, being unseen was not the same as being absent...") rather than letting the action and the "chalk arrow" symbol speak for themselves, which reduces the resonant power of the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains tightly controlled within the dweller's sensory limitations. However, the flow is severely disrupted by the clumsy insertion of the prompt phrase, which jars against the established rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the general prose quality is high, the required phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is pasted verbatim twice, creating severe tense mismatches ("flicker" vs "breathed/pulsed") and repetitive clutter. The second insertion occurs during the climax, breaking the narrative momentum and damaging the reading experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a vent-dwelling "finder" using ferromagnetic tape to unlock sense memories is imaginative and fresh. The synthesis of urban fantasy with a quiet, library setting works well, though the execution is marred by the structural and grammatical artifacts mentioned above.</comment>
