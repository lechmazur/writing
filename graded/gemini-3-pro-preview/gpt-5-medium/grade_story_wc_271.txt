<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rafi’s interiority is poignant, anchoring the trauma in specific sensory details like the "bodies crowded the edges" of the photo. However, the use of the diagnostic phrase "somatic markers" during the peak emotional beat (the gull rescue) creates a clinical distance that filters the immediate sensation of the "loosening" shoulders, slightly flattening the emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece effectively uses a Mosaic structure (Track B), teaching the pattern of temporal jumps early to cover a longer period. The transitions are legible, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the grafts represent "stitches" and healing—lands with genuine emotional weight. The summary nature of the transitions slightly dilutes the pressure of individual scenes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the arboretum on the cliff and the automated lighthouse are not just backdrops but active constraints that shape the narrative and themes. The contrast between the "shy sun" for the citrus and the "unblinking planet" of the gull's eye creates a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that grounds the abstract themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the internal conflict (trauma vs. present) is compelling. However, the conflict resolution in the gull scene feels somewhat rushed, and the "niece" segment operates more as a thematic deepening than a pressure-cooker escalation. The "Storm season" transition diffuses tension rather than tightening it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "anchoring optimism in realism" is woven beautifully into the gardening actions, culminating in the "grafts" and "stitches" imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of trauma, avoiding simplistic redemption in favor of earned shelter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, matching the "quietly talented" protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored in Rafi’s perception. The only slip is the intrusion of prompt-specific phrasing ("somatic markers") which feels distinct from the established voice's natural rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally dense and evocative ("skein of air snarling"), but the literal repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly talented" and "somatic markers" both appear twice) creates noticeable artifacts. These repetitions disrupt the otherwise polished flow and give the text a slight "checklist" quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the drone strike survivor narrative with the gentle, constructive act of gardening is fresh and moving. The "unmanned blessing" of the lighthouse provides a unique, memorable image that elevates the concept beyond a standard trauma narrative.</comment>
