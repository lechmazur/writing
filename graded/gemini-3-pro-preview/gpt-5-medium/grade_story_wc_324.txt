<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a compelling, empathetic vessel for the story's high-concept premise. The internal drive ("persistently curious") motivates the break from protocol, and the moment of realization regarding the "habit of tenderness" demonstrates strong perceptual depth. The interaction with the father reveals genuine emotional stakes, anchoring the surrealism in human grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a significant coincidence: selecting a specific hearing aid from a catalog based only on a vague description ("turned her right ear") which essentially acts as a magical homing beacon. While the genre invites surrealism, this specific causal link feels convenient rather than inevitable. The closure, however, is excellent, recontextualizing the "dead call" effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "mist-clad atrium" and the fog-laden city create a cohesive, dreamlike container for the plot. Specific details like the "glass that remembers every face" and the "smell of oranges" ground the metaphysical concepts in tactile sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but clear: the need to resolve a child's distress against the bureaucratic "wasteful" warning. The pressure escalates quietly but effectively through the journey, culminating in the emotional pivot where the father's grief—not the mother's ghost—becomes the true center of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of listening as an act of connection is beautifully developed, particularly in the insight that the "turned ear" was a gesture of affection rather than impairment. This "Conceptual Repricing" at the climax resonates powerfully, transforming the hearing aid from a medical device into a symbol of love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suited to the melancholic tone. The narrative distance is well-managed, allowing the surreal elements to feel factual within the story's reality. A slight reliance on formulaic simile structures prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, there is a high density of repetitive simile structures ("like wind," "like a swallowed star," "like a pocketed sparrow," "like an exit," "like exhausted mailmen," "like leaves," "like a hummingbird"). This creates a "template cadence" artifact that distracts from the otherwise strong imagery, triggering a penalty for density and repetitive scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is highly original and executed with freshness. The reversal—that the living father is the one haunting the line—transforms a ghost story trope into a poignant examination of grief, fulfilling the "Ingenuity" criteria admirably.</comment>
