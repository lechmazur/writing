<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinct, successfully blending the weariness of a "defunct revolutionary" with the lyrical intensity of a poet. The motivation—to reclaim history from a narrative of tyranny—is compelling and clearly drives the action. Ledger serves as a functional, if slightly archetypal, foil; while he represents the opposing view clearly, his "immaculate cruelty" feels a touch monochromatic compared to the narrator's nuanced melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, utilizing the "visible time" premise to drive both plot and resolution. The "mirror ritual" backstory is woven in effectively, serving as a setup that pays off beautifully in the climax without feeling like a Deus Ex Machina. The closure—a revision of the archive coupled with the loss of the shard—lands with genuine conceptual and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and integral to the plot; the "baroque asteroid" with its "ruptured salons" creates a unique, tangible atmosphere. The physical manifestation of time as "gilt dust" and "veils" is handled with consistent sensory logic that grounds the fantastical elements. The environment actively constrains and shapes the characters' tactics, particularly in the use of the storms and scaffolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined early on—the historical memory of a civilization—and escalate naturally from an academic dispute to a public tribunal. The pressure mounts effectively as Ledger moves to strip the narrator's access, forcing the high-risk demonstration in the council hall. The cost is felt in the final sacrifice of the shard, ensuring the victory isn't cheap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "ornament as solidarity" is sophisticated and developed through concrete imagery rather than abstract exposition. The resolution avoids a simple "good vs. evil" binary by acknowledging that the revolution remains defunct and the proof (the shard) destroys itself in the telling. The ending resonates with a earned melancholy that recontextualizes the struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The first-person POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical register that fits the character's "poetically inclined" trait without slipping into incoherence. The narrative voice modulates well between the sharp observation of the rival professor and the tender description of the artifact. The perceptual signature is distinct and immersive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is lush and highly polished, with standout phrases like "breath marks for a silent choir." However, the density of metaphor occasionally strains clarity; "oxidized velvet iron" is difficult to parse visually, and "planets ticking like clockwork grapes" feels like a mixed image that distracts rather than illuminates. The rhythm and sound, however, are largely excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central premise—time becoming visible as physical debris on a baroque asteroid—is strikingly original and executed with confidence. The synthesis of sci-fi setting with a nearly fantasy-like magic system (covering mirrors to silence the past) feels fresh and specific. The intellectual angle of the archaeological dispute adds a unique layer to the genre elements.</comment>
