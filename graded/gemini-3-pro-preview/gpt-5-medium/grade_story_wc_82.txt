<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation ("luminous torment") is vividly embodied in his craft, grounding the magical premise in tangible labor. His internal state drives the ritual, and the final shift—from obsession to a "loosening" of the ache—feels earned by the process on the page. The moment of bowing "without expectation" marks a strong, character-defining choice that solidifies his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal path where the protagonist’s specific actions (brewing cranes from vapor) force a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The logic of the magic system holds together well, with the prompt’s constraints (shadow, stairs) integrated into the plot’s progression. Closure is effective, offering a distinct shift in the status quo (shadow remains separate but the burden lifts) rather than a tidy fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the steam from the tea and the light of the basilica become the literal tools of the resolution. The "floating island" and "glass basilica" are rendered with sensory precision that constrains the protagonist's options (e.g., using vapor instead of paper). This deep integration of environment and agency justifies the high mark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal but successfully externalized through the "rupture" of the vision and the shadow’s physical return. The escalation—from polishing lenses to folding steam to releasing the flock—raises the stakes of the ritual appropriately. While the opposition is abstract, the pressure of the "ache" is sustained until the final release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of processing grief through craft is handled with sophistication, avoiding a simple cure in favor of a new equilibrium. The subtext of the shadow as a detached part of the self resonates strongly. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraph's tendency to explicitly state the thesis ("as if sunlight knew grief well enough..."), which dilutes the power of the image itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like atmosphere. However, the reliance on a specific syntactic pattern (noun-verb-like-noun) creates a repetitive cadence that occasionally draws attention away from the character's immediate experience. The tone is cohesive, but the rhythmic uniformity limits the emotional range during peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from "simileitis," with a high density of "like" and "as" constructions (e.g., "like a spoon," "like a confession," "faithful as thunder") that clutter the imagery. While individual images are beautiful, their frequency acts as a scaffold that distances the reader from the action. "Faithful as thunder" is a mixed metaphor that momentarily confuses the physical logic of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the prompt elements—specifically the "steam origami" within a "glass basilica" to catch a lost shadow—is inventive and visually striking. The story transforms standard fantasy tropes into a fresh, specific vision with a unique aesthetic logic. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, blending the emotional and magical tracks seamlessly.</comment>
