<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent, distinct figure with clear agency and a specific skillset. The backstory of the sister provides a necessary emotional anchor, though the character relies more on procedural competence than on deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative trajectory, building density through the ritualistic mapping process. The transition from the orchard to the lake is seamless, and the closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration that effectively breaks the established silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional, with the cold and silence functioning as tangible constraints that shape the magic system. Specific details like "nickel-cold," "glassed ash," and the "scab the shape of a closed eye" ground the fantasy in visceral reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (survival/escape) and the environmental pressure is constant. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's skill and endurance, though it lacks a severe cost or painful trade-off to push it into the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of translating lost life into a guide for the living is resonant and beautifully executed. The ending image of the lake exhaling offers a poetic, non-literal answer to the story's central problem without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and precise, perfectly matching the "moving stillness" of the tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining focus on the alchemical procedure while allowing glimpses of emotional depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-density with striking imagery ("sap frozen mid-throb," "humming like a moth"). However, the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "demonstrating patience physically" creates a noticeable scaffold artifact that disrupts the otherwise polished surface.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and magical realist elements. The concept of "audio-mancy"—using a storybook plate and starlight to map root-heartbeats—feels genuinely ingenious and specific to this world.</comment>
