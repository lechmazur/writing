<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously mapped to the external action, creating a seamless blend of role and psyche. The transition from a "weary undertaker" performing rote duties to a custodian of the library is earned through decisive, character-specific choices. The renunciation of the surface world ("tell them the undertaker is not missing") serves as a powerful, cost-laden closure to the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent surreal logic where the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the distress signal—lands with significant conceptual weight. While the discovery of the specific manual ("Manual for Beacon Keepers") via the lens feels slightly convenient as a plot device, the subsequent action and the refusal to yield to the storm firmly ground the resolution in protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active participant that constrains movement and dictates the physics of the scene. The "impossible spaces" and "thin as breath" water are not just backdrop but tactile barriers that shape the protagonist's method. The atmosphere is dense and specific, elevating the library from a location to a crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly from the initial arrival of the package to the physical manifestation of "chased stillness." The climax turns on a decisive risk—ignoring the manual's warning about storms—driven by the protagonist's specific trait. The resolution is not a battle won by force, but a reconfiguration of the rules of engagement, satisfying the "rest" stake with a tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a navigational challenge is explored with nuance and emotional intelligence. The story resists a tidy moral about "moving on," opting instead for a complex validation of "staying" and memory. The shift from SOS to SOR serves as a potent, non-literal answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly tuned to the story’s melancholic magical realism. The focalization remains tight, filtering the surreal imagery through the specific professional lens of an undertaker (measuring days by names, linen, stamps). The control of tone prevents the dense imagery from becoming confusing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly textured, with strong sensory anchoring. However, the second explicit invocation of "inadvertently stubborn" feels slightly mechanical, functioning more as a prompt-check than organic interiority. A few phrases ("sealed in glass domes and regret") lean towards abstraction, but the overall craft is high-caliber.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mortuary, lighthouse, and underwater library tropes creates a fresh, memorable specific vision. The conceptual twist of re-coding the distress signal provides a unique solution to a classic ghost-story problem. The story feels genuinely inventive within its genre constraints.</comment>
