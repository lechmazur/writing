<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s professional background is not merely ornamental; it dictates her perceptual filter and drives the central conflict between "flamboyant fireworks" and "simpler mathematics." The resolution—a methodological pivot in her life’s work—is a earned character beat that manifests visible cost (abandoning her previous flashy models). Internal contradiction is successfully dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, building texture until the pivotal examination of the butterfly dust triggers a Conceptual Repricing of her research. Closure is resonant, reconfiguring her approach to both the greenhouse and the stars ("recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal"). The summary beat with the neighbors handles time compression smoothly without breaking the drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with tactile specificity ("algae slicked tiles," "tomatoes gone to filaments") that directly mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The micro-setting of the dust on the slide acts as the essential bridge between the macro (neutron stars) and the micro (greenhouse), charging the final image with earned significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and intellectual, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. The tightening occurs as Mara rejects the "drama" of the storm in favor of "quiet decay," a choice that narrows her future tactics. While the arrival of neighbors dissipates some immediate physical isolation, the internal stakes regarding her work remain taut and resolve clearly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "gentleness" and "gradual change" versus "melodrama" is woven masterfully into every beat, from the sweeping of silt to the coding of pulsars. The ending avoids heavy-handed moralizing, instead offering a resonant synthesis of the story’s dual tracks (astronomy and gardening) that feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and consistent, merging scientific lexicon ("preprocess," "calibration," "vortices") with lyrical observation in a way that feels unique to Mara's consciousness. The perceptual signature is strong; we see the world exactly as a neutron star researcher would.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense, rhythmic, and polished. The density of simile and metaphor linking nature to mathematics ("clouds like equations," "tasks like constellations," "arithmetic of survival") is high; while effective for the voice, it occasionally borders on being overwrought. The "kindled humility" line is slightly abstract, but overall control is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-energy astrophysics and the slow, muddy work of flood recovery creates a genuinely fresh perspective on trauma. Mapping pulsar glitches to greenhouse repairs is an ingenious conceit that transforms a familiar "cleanup" trope into something specific and memorable.</comment>
