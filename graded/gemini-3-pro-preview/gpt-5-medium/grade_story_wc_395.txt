<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist has a distinct professional identity and a clear internal conflict between policy and memory. The trait "brightly attentive" is stated directly as a label, though it functionally enables the investigation. While the internal motivation is strong, the emotional connection to the victim relies heavily on poetic assertion ("sensed absence turn solid") rather than dramatized interaction or relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a clear inciting incident, investigation, and decisive resolution. The middle section relies on low-resistance beats—the "lie" to the bot functions instantly without complication, and the Sink accepts the numbers on the first try. The closure is a valid Decisive Change that alters the status quo and thematic stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting of the "social network archive" is rendered with vivid, atmospheric detail ("smelled like old servers," "sweeping a beach at night"). The "Sink" and its lyric challenge create a specific, memorable digital-physical geography. The sensory details effectively ground the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes (job vs. truth) are established early and the final choice carries stated professional risk. However, the escalation is mild; the obstacles (the team's shrug, the access bot, the password) crumble immediately upon contact, reducing the felt pressure prior to the climax. The cost is acknowledged but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of digital erasure and the persistence of grief is handled with sophistication and consistency. The central motif of the numbers threading through deleted files resonates powerfully at the end. The final image ("Still here, still counting") provides a non-literal, resonant answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent "lyrical noir" tone suited to a digital archivist. The perspective is controlled, filtering the world through the metaphor of excavation and acoustics. At times, the voice risks becoming overly dense with figurative language, but it remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. However, there is a tendency toward simile churn ("like a tide," "like a mouth," "like surf," "like justice") which occasionally draws attention away from the action. Phrases like "smelled... of unsung birthdays" strain sensory logic, crossing into sentimental abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a digital afterlife archivist is a familiar trope, but the execution offers fresh elements like the "Sink" lyric challenge and the use of metadata as a narrative map. The synthesis of cold case procedural with digital metaphysics feels specific and well-realized.</comment>
