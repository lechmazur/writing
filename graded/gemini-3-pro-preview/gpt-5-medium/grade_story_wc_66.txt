<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific skill set (orchestra copyist) nicely informs the narrative voice and the method of resolution ("copying the cadence"). However, the character functions more as a lyrical archetype than a flesh-and-blood survivor; the "story famine" is stated as context but the visceral hunger or cost of that deprivation is aestheticized rather than embodied in difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from listening to participation to commitment. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration (the promise and the internal "cadence marker"). While the causality is dreamlike and low-resistance, the internal progression is coherent and the ending lands with a clear conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, with evocative details like "needle-snow" and "brick bones." The setting feels distinct and immersive, though at times the density of metaphor ("rooms... warm as memory") threatens to obscure the physical grounding of the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is largely conceptual—silence vs. story—rather than dramatic. The interaction with Cinder is cooperative and smooth; the protagonist faces little resistance or risk in tuning the radio or accepting the charge. The stakes, while thematically high ("story famine"), feel low in the immediate scene because the cost of failure is not dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of preserving culture through diligence and notation is handled with elegance. The central metaphor of dust and music coheres well, and the ending offers a resonant answer to the premise without becoming overly moralistic, though it leans slightly into romanticizing the artist's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, consistently filtering the world through the lexicon of a copyist (measures, slurs, cadence). The control of tone is strong, maintaining a "thistled calm" throughout. The voice risks becoming monochromatic in its reverence, but it suits the fable-like mode perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled ("moths wrote jittery annotations"), passing the read-aloud test. However, the density of figurative language is high, occasionally slipping into mixed or obscure imagery ("translated by a wary hallway," "choreography for grit") that prioritizes sound over precise meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic survival with music theory and radio mysticism is a fresh take on the "preserving stories" trope. The specific imagery of the copyist interacting with dust elevates the premise beyond a standard genre exercise.</comment>
