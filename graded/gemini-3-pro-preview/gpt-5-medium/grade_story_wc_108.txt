<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's stunt-double background is brilliantly integrated into the decryption method (dates of broken bones), grounding the character in physical history. However, the emotional pivot from betrayal to cooperation feels rushed and slightly under-motivated; the immediate acceptance of the "brother" and the shared plan compresses a complex reaction into a convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative drive is clear, but the causality relies on an unexplained magical convenience: a seashell found after a stunt that somehow functions as a verification device for a child's code. This disconnect between the gritty, realistic premise (debts, stunts) and the sudden divinatory magic of the shell weakens the structural logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and tactile, with "iron stacks" and "tidebreath" creating a distinct, rusty-lyric atmosphere. The environment effectively constrains the action, providing the specific tools (skylight, cast, darkness) needed for the decryption scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tension escalates effectively through the puzzle sequence, leveraging the narrator's fears against the need for answers. The stakes (identity, safety) are high, though the "men with knives" remain abstract, and the conflict dissolves somewhat too easily into a cooperative planning session at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but suffers from "Thematic Echo"; the narrator explicitly states the moral ("I wanted to prove that vulnerability is power") twice, converting potential subtext into on-the-nose text. This didactic assertion in the resolution phase flattens the earned complexity of the reconciliation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, poetic, and melancholic, fitting the "rusted library" aesthetic well. The lyricism generally enhances the mood ("memory scraping against sky"), though occasionally it borders on overwrought ("apologized without excuses... answered without armor").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong, fresh imagery ("syllables like rope over wood"). However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("firmly adaptive," "transformative betrayal") creates slight rhythmic stumbles, reading as labels rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stuntman's identity crisis with a library scavenger hunt is fresh and engaging. The "broken bones as combination" is a standout ingenious detail, though the magical shell element feels like a borrowed trope that doesn't fully mesh with the otherwise grounded danger.</comment>
