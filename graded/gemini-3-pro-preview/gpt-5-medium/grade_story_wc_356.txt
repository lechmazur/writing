<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc from ambition to stewardship is clear and thematically resonant. However, the &quot;ambition&quot; is stated more than dramatized; the choice to plant the seed feels like a natural step rather than a painful trade-off against a competing desire, limiting the emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fable-like structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a legible &quot;Resonant Reconfiguration&quot; closure where the village accepts the smell for stability. The causal link between the scent and the physical steadying of the bridges relies on dream logic, which works for the genre but softens the mechanical stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The treetop setting is vivid and essential to the plot, particularly the swaying bridges. The olfactory details (&quot;storm sap,&quot; &quot;feral and cavernous&quot;) ground the fantasy elements effectively, though &quot;dreamt underground&quot; is a slight continuity slip for a soil-less village.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>External pressure (shaking bridges) escalates clearly, but the opposition (neighbors' whispers) is mild and easily overcome. The resolution arrives somewhat conveniently through the flower's magic rather than a difficult tactical adaptation by the protagonist; the cost (the smell) is accepted too quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of &quot;rot as balance&quot; is coherent and integrated into the ending image. However, the delivery is occasionally heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements like the grandmother's note and the flies' lesson rather than purely subtextual emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and mythic tone appropriate for the setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the use of &quot;journalize&quot; clashes slightly with the otherwise organic, archaic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and atmospheric but suffers from occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors (&quot;stitched the canopy,&quot; &quot;truths had teeth&quot;). The phrasing &quot;turning of the tide's thought&quot; appears verbatim twice, feeling like a forced insertion rather than a natural temporal anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the corpse flower with a treetop structural crisis is a fresh concept. While the &quot;wise herbalist&quot; trope is familiar, the specific sensory focus provides enough novelty to elevate the premise.</comment>
