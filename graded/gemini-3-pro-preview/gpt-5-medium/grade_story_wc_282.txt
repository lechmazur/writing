<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by a distinct, high-concept motivation ("voice of the unknown") that drives specific, costly on-page choices (leaving the fossil). The internal posture of "negotiation" rather than "ownership" is rigorously maintained. While the character is somewhat archetypal, their agency in the climax—choosing the contract over safety—elevates the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship between observer and observed, paid for with the loss of the fossil. The narrative arc from "sensory mapping" to "partnered contract" is seamless and causal under the Textural/Situational lens. The storm provides a sharp, coherent pressure that forces the final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant, rigorously detailed with sensory specificity ("green vein through gray," "mineral hair") that constrains action and defines the method of inquiry. The "thermal grammar" of the cave merges setting and tool into a singular, immersive experience that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure creates a clear arc: the need for connection is tested by the physical threat of the storm. The climax forces a trade-off (safety vs. the fossil/trust) that is executed cleanly. The stakes are internal and relational but dramatized through concrete physical danger, satisfying the demand for visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of interspecies communication and deep time is woven into every beat, culminating in a profound "shared sentence" between human and rock. The concept of "transitional objects" is deployed not just as jargon but as the structural engine of the emotional arc, achieving high resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and maintains a "factually mystical" register that perfectly suits the premise. The perceptual signature is unique, filtering the world through "thermal grammar" and "microcurrents," creating a consistent and immersive narrative distance that never slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A slight echo in the similes ("thin as a held breath" / "like a held vowel") is the only minor artifact preventing a higher score, but the extended metaphor of language/grammar is executed with high craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise creates a fresh synthesis of sci-fi post-humanism and nature writing, treating the "emotions" of geology with a serious, tactile methodology. The "heat-mapping" of stone emotions avoids whimsy and lands as a credible, risky artistic choice that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
