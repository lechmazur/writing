<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to defeat emotional numbness") is stated clearly but resolved somewhat cleanly through the ritual's success rather than a high-cost personal struggle. While the narrator functions effectively as a witness and judge, Neri and Rae serve primarily as symbolic archetypes (soft vs. sharp) to facilitate the thematic argument rather than as fully realized individuals with internal contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, moving from the introduction of the petitioners to the sparring tests and a decisive resolution. The "river" epiphany effectively sets up the logic for the final judgment (the "circuit"), ensuring the closure feels earned by the established rules of the world. The "history rewrites itself" refrain adds texture but operates loosely on the causal level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, integrating the "floating rock dojo" with the thematic elements of flow and balance ("clouds pass under the sparring floor"). Sensory details like "sick morning scars" and "umber tiles" ground the high-concept premise. The environment actively participates in the narrative, with statues rearranging themselves to reflect the future.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, and the tension escalates appropriately during the training and final test. However, the resolution—a "third way" of joint custody—feels intellectually satisfying but emotionally low-cost; the characters accept the judgment without significant resistance, softening the dramatic impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of "complementary opposites" is coherent and tightly woven into the plot's resolution mechanism. While the thematic delivery is occasionally didactic ("Master Lin taught through complementary opposites"), the final image of the circuit vivifying the future resonates well with the established motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, mythic tone that suits the speculative wuxia genre. The "ego death survivor" perspective colors the narration effectively, lending a detached yet observant quality that fits the role of a judge. The rhythm of the prose supports the meditative pacing of the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and polished, with strong imagery ("names loosened like threads in seawater"). However, the integration of required phrases occasionally feels mechanical ("slices through pretense" appears twice), and some metaphors border on overwriting ("blade of attention"). The pacing remains controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of genres—a martial arts tournament combined with a legal custody battle for a clone brain—is fresh and inventive. The conceptual resolution, treating the custody not as possession but as an electrical circuit requiring alternating currents, offers a genuinely original take on the prompt's elements.</comment>
