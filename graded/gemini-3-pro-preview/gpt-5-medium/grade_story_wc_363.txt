<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kio's motivation is clear and poetic, but her interiority is often submerged under heavy lyrical abstraction rather than grounded emotion. The "cost" of her magic ("thin herself") is stated as a metaphysical rule rather than dramatized through visceral struggle or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fable logic creates a coherent vessel for the narrative, establishing the "puzzle edges as border" rule effectively. Closure lands well with a resonant connection, though the shift to the brother's perspective is a slight structural convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, with the "dead river" and "bamboo forest" acting as tangible constraints that force the magical solution. Sensory details like "apricot blossom dust" and "attic thunder" effectively ground the fable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established, but the conflict remains largely internal and passive; the obstacle of distance is overcome by ritual rather than escalating pressure. The cost of the magic is abstract ("latent sacrifice"), lacking a concrete on-page price paid by the character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thematic exploration of borders, memory, and connection is the story's standout strength, synthesizing the puzzle/loom conceit into a poignant emotional truth. The ending image of burying the borders resonates strongly with the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident and consistently lyrical, suitable for a fable, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory. The control of psychic distance is generally good, despite the brief, mostly effective shard jump to the brother.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high metaphorical density that occasionally obscures meaning ("sirens bit it away"). A significant flaw is the verbatim repetition of distinctive phrases ("stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence"), which read as mechanical insertions rather than intentional refrains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central conceit of weaving jigsaw puzzle edges to create a metaphysical "border" for a message is imaginative and fresh. The synthesis of the loom, the amber, and the puzzle pieces creates a unique magical realism logic.</comment>
