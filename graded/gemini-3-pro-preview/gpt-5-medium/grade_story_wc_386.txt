<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator is a distinct, competent guide with a consistent worldview, though they function more as a lyrical catalyst than a character at risk. The lack of deep internal conflict or personal cost keeps the characterization from the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear, but the mystery resolution relies on a logic leap: the ghost knowing the specific welding company’s name implies improbable gnosis during the drowning. The ending transitions quickly into fable logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral and vivid; the "shrine carved into glacier ice" and "windows of connection" physically constrain and shape the interaction with the dead. The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation is steady, but the climax lacks resistance; the corporation surrenders immediately to the "metered hymn," rendering the victory poetic but dramatically low-voltage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of healing through truth is resonant, though the story explicates its moral ("exposure is a gentle blade") rather than letting the action fully carry the subtext in the final act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, successfully maintaining the "ghost whisperer" persona. The shift to a collective "we" at the end is earned by the setup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While often beautiful, the prose suffers from metaphor congestion ("sky brightens like an eyelid," "prayers drift like plankton"). The line "cut corners so hard the ship blushed" is a tonal break and a mixed metaphor that disrupts the gravity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving and séance via a "melted snow globe" black box is a fresh, compelling image. The "evil corporation" reveal is standard, but the execution is inventive.</comment>
