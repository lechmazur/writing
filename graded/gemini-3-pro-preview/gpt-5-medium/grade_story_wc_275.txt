<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and embodied ("hands remember restraint"), but her composure is so absolute that the scene lacks the friction of genuine internal struggle or formidable opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands, though the convenient discovery of the letter at the exact moment of resolution weakens the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and tactile; the "vestibule sand" and "thresholds of roses" effectively ground the fable-like tone in physical specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tension is introduced with the knife, but the antagonists capitulate to the setting's atmosphere too easily, bypassing the need for a high-cost tactical choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic resonance on mercy and debt is strong, though the narrative occasionally relies on explicit statements of value ("gentleness, steadiness") rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident and consistently lyrical, effectively filtering the world through the protagonist's "senselessly perceptive" lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but dense with metaphor ("velvet bucket," "spines like sundials"), which sometimes feels ornamental rather than urgent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A well-integrated fable that synthesizes the prompt elements smoothly, though the "sanctuary in ruin" concept is executed with low risk.</comment>
