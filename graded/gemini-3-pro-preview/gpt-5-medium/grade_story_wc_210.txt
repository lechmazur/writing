<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iria is a strong, archetypal figure whose competence drives the narrative. Her internal state is well-defined by the "refusal of false comfort," though her interiority feels somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally vulnerable. The sailor serves as an effective, functional foil who validates her ethos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a smooth, fable-like arc of accumulation (gathering people, stacking plans) rather than sharp reversals. While the closure—the bottle ticking as a sign of earned time—is thematically resonant and satisfies the conceptual stakes, the plot lacks significant active opposition, making the success feel slightly inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and does heavy lifting, grounding the fable in "salt," "ash," and "warped timbers." The transition from a ruined "paper-lantern cove" to a place of "firebreak gardens" creates a vivid, lived-in progression that mirrors the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established—the survival of civilization itself—but the conflict is largely man-against-entropy rather than active antagonism. The "cost" is shown in labor and patience (broomstrokes, arguments), which is effective, though the lack of acute, moment-to-moment jeopardy limits the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematically excellent; the shift from "wishes" to "labor" is woven into every beat, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The story resists simple moralizing by focusing on the mechanics of community building (prices, cisterns) as the true antidote to magic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, mythic, and consistent, suiting the "post-magical fable" genre well. It handles the elevated tone without drifting into abstraction, though the prompt-mandated phrase "working memory" creates a slight register clash with the alchemical aesthetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with striking imagery ("debts paid in broomstrokes," "heart of a clock waiting for hands"). However, the forced inclusion of the modern cognitive term "working memory" disrupts the fantasy register, and there is a minor tense slip in the first paragraph ("still she rejects").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a post-wish society rebuilding through mundane logistics is a fresh, grounded take on the "magic goes away" trope. Using the empty bottle as a battery for "time" and "effort" rather than magic is an ingenious conceptual turn.</comment>
