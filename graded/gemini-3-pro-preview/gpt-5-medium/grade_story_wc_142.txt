<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nessa’s voice is distinct, and her agency drives the resolution. The "dual allegiance" is externalized well through the brother, though the internal emotional cost is sometimes told ("arguments were soft but sharp") rather than fully dramatized in the moment. Her motivation is clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure ("bought us only a season") provides a valid earned stasis. However, the climax relies on a convenient mechanical solution—the chip interacting with the console to move the city—which resolves the tension with "mythic" ease rather than causal struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and integral to the plot; the raft city’s "breathing" and "creaking" create a vivid tactile atmosphere. The physical layout of the city actively constrains the characters and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as the loss of home and culture. The escalation involving the VIP fences and the liaison is strong, though the antagonist's capitulation to the "numbers" immediately after the city shifts feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of gentrification vs. memory is powerful and resonates in the final image. At times, the thematic delivery is didactic ("Monetize will always mean gentrification"), explicitly stating the subtext rather than letting it emerge solely from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, fitting the "poet/culture" archetype well. The specific "color grammar" and metaphorical language ("laughter was being leased") create a strong, unique perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and good rhythm. The imagery is evocative ("tide that buys new paint"), though occasionally the metaphorical density threatens to slow momentum in the first half.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a kinetic raft city reorganizing itself to resist gentrification is a fresh, specific take on a common trope. The synthesis of carnival atmosphere with corporate encroachment feels original and lived-in.</comment>
