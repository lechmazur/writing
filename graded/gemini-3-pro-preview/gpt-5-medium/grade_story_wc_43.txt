<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrator functions as a flawless facilitator without internal conflict or personal stakes, resulting in perfect emotional calibration where no choice carries risk. The protagonist displays no contradictory impulses, serving only to execute the plot's requirements with "decisive" competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration (death and reconciliation), but the progression is strictly linear with no meaningful obstacles. The causal chain—therapist calls, son arrives, reconciliation occurs—lacks the friction or complexity expected in literary fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is a strength, particularly in the "hymning the mundane" sequence (radiator clang, sneaker squeak). The hospice setting ("radiant haven") is vivid, though occasionally the description tilts toward the flowery ("light pool... like a gentle river").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dramatic tension is undercut by the ease of resolution; a lifetime of estrangement is bridged instantly upon the son's arrival without dialogue or resistance. The goal of a "flawless goodbye" is achieved too flawlessly, removing the possibility of failure or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding music in the mundane is distinct, but the subtext is often made text through on-the-nose dialogue ("we can reunify what matters"). The emotional resonance feels unearned due to the lack of interpersonal struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, establishing a distinct rhythm that suits the hospice setting. However, the dialogue suffers from poetic artificiality; characters speak in metaphors ("shards are sharp... like memory") rather than natural speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm and sentence variety are competent, but the prose relies on worn clichés ("dawn lifts like a curtain," "eyes ocean deep") that flatten the imagery. While the musical descriptions are inventive, these stock phrases lower the overall craft score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central conceit of a music therapist using ambient noise ("hymning the mundane") is fresh and inventive. However, the surrounding plot of a deathbed reconciliation via a sudden phone call is a standard trope executed without a new angle.</comment>
