<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is clearly drawn, and her choice not to sand the knot is a strong character beat. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic summaries ("working to harvest lessons from loss") rather than embodied feeling, which creates a barrier to deep empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure fits the meditative tone, and the closure—refusing to restore the name—provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The narrative arc is slight but coherent, effectively holding the Accumulative lens through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with the "ash wood" and "rain-beaded skylight" grounding the abstraction effectively. Sensory details are rich and purposeful, though the reliance on "silver music" and personified rain occasionally pushes the atmosphere toward the ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kettle functions effectively as a ticking clock, providing necessary structural pressure to the otherwise quiet internal conflict. The stakes are legible, with the decision to leave the wood "scuffed" serving as a meaningful micro-turn that carries the emotional weight of the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is heavily explicated through summary lines ("Absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness") rather than allowed to emerge organically from the subtext. The story explains its own symbols and meaning, which reduces the potential for resonant discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly mediated by authorial poetics, creating a filter between the character and the reader. The relentless metaphorical interpretation of every object suggests a writer at work rather than the immediate, lived experience of the widow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The piece suffers from an extreme density of similes (ropes like skins, tigers like uncles, whistle like child, kettle like cat) that clogs the narrative flow. This "figurative muddle" draws attention to the writing itself, rendering the prose decorative and static rather than propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of the circus widow finding closure through carving is distinct and executed with specific, atmospheric detail. While the "epiphany through craft" arc is a familiar literary shape, the specific context of the circus loft elevates the material.</comment>
