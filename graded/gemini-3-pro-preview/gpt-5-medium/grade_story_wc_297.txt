<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "root-bound" constraint efficiently physicalizes the character's role, grounding the visionary voice in a tangible limitation. While the emotional interiority is sometimes subsumed by the dense metaphorical register, the protagonist's choices are active and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration of the world's rules. The climax relies slightly on symbolic assertion ("we told them no") rather than a complex tactical maneuver, but the closure is distinct and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the protagonist's graft to the maple tree dictates the scene's physics and possibilities. The imagery ("residual lightning," "pool of night") creates a cohesive atmosphere that charges the final resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptually high, pitting the gardeners' desire for restoration against the protagonists' new reality. The resolution feels slightly effortless as the antagonists capitulate to a verbal refusal, lacking a final intensification of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of navigating a broken timeline is handled with sophistication, culminating in the "maze as grammar" metaphor. The "braided vow" offers a nuanced, non-binary answer to the central conflict of order versus growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and sustains a difficult high-lyric register without breaking. The "visionary" persona perfectly justifies the elevated diction and surreal imagery, creating a consistent perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and information-dense; phrases like "wrapped in wax paper and rumor" show mastery of compression. A few moments border on overwrought ("blistered by possibilities"), but the style supports the fabulist tone effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of arboreal imagery, time distortion, and ceremonial magic creates a genuinely fresh conceptual space. The central metaphor of the maze growing from a clipping is inventive and memorable.</comment>
