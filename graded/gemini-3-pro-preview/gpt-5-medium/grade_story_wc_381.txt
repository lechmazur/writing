<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The summoner is a competent, focused protagonist with a clear goal, fitting the mythic tone well. However, they lack internal conflict or significant flaws; their success feels inevitable and frictionless, lacking the "felt cost" or difficult micro-choices required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Decisive Change via Conceptual Repricing) is legible and structurally sound. The "fix-it" nature of the plot, where a ritual solves a global threat without setbacks or unexpected consequences, limits the dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, active, and integral to the plot; the brook functions as a character and tool rather than just a backdrop. The atmospheric details ("mason-jar fireflies," "moonmilk") strongly support the magical realism tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the conceptual stakes are high (dystopian future vs. organic peace), the on-page pressure is low; the antagonist (the code) resists briefly but is overcome with ease. The lack of a visible trade-off or painful sacrifice flattens the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of organic silence versus industrial noise is threaded consistently through action and imagery. While slightly didactic ("grammar without grievance"), the resonance at closure is distinct and earned by the text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent high-lyric register that suits the fable-like quality. The narrative distance is controlled, though the relentless poeticism occasionally distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Imagery is often striking, but the prose suffers from metaphor density ("blaze of listening," "lantern of calm") and syntactic monotony, with most sentences following a rigid Subject-Verb structure. This creates a drumbeat rhythm that drags the pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, cartography, and sound magic offers a fresh take on the "nature vs. machine" trope. The specific mechanism of "mapping silence" provides a unique and imaginative narrative engine.</comment>
