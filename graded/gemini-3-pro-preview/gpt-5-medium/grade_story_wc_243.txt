<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The archivist’s voice is distinct and consistent, but the "haunted euphoria" remains a told label rather than an embodied, contradictory state. The woman serves primarily as a vessel for the theme, lacking agency beyond the initial request, and the emotional resolution feels slightly unearned by character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The resolution relies on the convenient arrival of the partner at the precise moment the "map" is finished, acting as a soft reset that resolves the central tension externally. The causality implies a fable-like magic that isn't fully established, making the climax feel like a coincidence rather than a protagonist-driven outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and functionally integrated; details like "sea thrift" and "glasswort" ground the abstract work of the archivist. The physical environment (tide, salt, fading light) actively supports the pacing and thematic weight of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and low-resistance; the woman accepts the archivist’s method immediately, and the conflict dissolves upon the partner's arrival. The narrative lacks a moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off or pay a visible cost to achieve the result.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "proximate causes" is compelling, but the execution leans heavily on dialogue that articulates the thesis ("Lines are causes if you walk them") rather than letting subtext carry the weight. The resonance is present but slightly sermonizing in the final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is strong, atmospheric, and consistent, effectively maintaining the fable-like register. The lyrical style generally works well, though it occasionally risks becoming precious ("swallows stitched dusk to the sea") without breaking the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, but occasionally overwrought; the image of a locket photo that "clicked softly with each tremor of her breath" strains physical credibility for the sake of melodrama. Imagery is generally strong, though "haunted euphoria bright as salt" feels like a mixed metaphor that obscures rather than clarifies emotion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of archiving and relationship repair is fresh and imaginative, creating a distinct "archivist of moments" archetype. However, the resolution—a magical or coincidental reunion on a jetty—treads familiar ground in the genre of sentimental realism.</comment>
