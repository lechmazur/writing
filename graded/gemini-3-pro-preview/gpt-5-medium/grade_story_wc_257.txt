<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich, but the dialogue drifts into diagnostic thematic speech ("intention honors even the broken plans"), which reads more like an authorial thesis than a character interaction. The transition from jeweler to "tutor" is stated elegantly but relies on abstract motivation rather than dramatized psychological pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The structure effectively transitions from setup to a mosaic of service and finally to a specific scene, ending in valid Earned Stasis. The convenience of the observatory's readiness (keys, password, mechanism) and the dream-logic of the origami invites soften the causal grounding, but the arc holds together well as a fable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory is utilized as a tool that constrains and shapes the narrative action rather than just a backdrop. The interplay of light, dust, and the specific mechanics of the projector successfully anchors the abstract themes in tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and defined early, though the external pressure remains low; the conflict resolves through philosophical acceptance rather than a high-cost choice. The interaction with the mother provides a necessary focal point for escalation, though the resolution comes via explanation rather than action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central theme is poignant but over-articulated; the characters explain the symbols ("they are curtains of intention") rather than letting the imagery do the work. This explicitness, particularly the moralizing in the final paragraph ("The night does not forgive haste..."), limits the interpretive resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. However, the uniformity of the register—where dialogue sounds exactly like the narration—flattens the distinction between the narrator and the mother.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is lush and often beautiful ("light found dust like a river finds silt"), though occasionally dense with abstract metaphors that slow momentum. Line-level control is strong, though the "pocket water" simile is slightly opaque.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept of repurposing a planetarium to project tattoos for the grieving is highly original and visually arresting. It successfully synthesizes the prompt elements into a fresh, memorable narrative frame.</comment>
