<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator is a distinct, competent professional with a clear voice and agency. The "guarded heart" arc offers a subtle internal shift, though the "warlike serenity" trait leans slightly on stylized description rather than deep, simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causality is tight and the problem-solution spine (seed eats lie) is established and executed cleanly. Closure is decisive with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship between mayor, town, and truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "swirling orchard vortex" is a vividly imagined, high-concept setting that constrains the investigation and charges the final imagery ("ordinary halos"). The sensory details (creaks, bone whistles, kelp lines) establish a unique, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear for the client (mayor), and the escalation follows a logical investigative path. The tension holds well, though the protagonist's personal risk is primarily professional pride rather than visceral danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drowned orchard backstory creates a strong thematic rhyme with the "unbloomed" lake vortex. The resolution avoids a simple moral, focusing instead on the weight and "shadows" of spoken vs. withheld truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, blending noir cynicism with fantasy elements seamlessly. The "measure by circles" perception filter is distinct and maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished, with striking metaphors ("turn the sky like a crank"). A few phrases border on overwrought ("suspended between teeth and tide"), but the rhythm and imagery largely support the magical realism tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of noir detective tropes with a surreal, magical lake setting feels fresh and specific. The "lie-eating seed" is a creative, non-obvious mechanism for the resolution.</comment>
