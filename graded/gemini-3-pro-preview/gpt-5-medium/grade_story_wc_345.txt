<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The collective "we" relies heavily on summary ("We argued," "We feasted") rather than dramatized scene work, flattening individual agency and internal conflict. The characters function as a passive hive mind responding to external directions without distinct friction or personal cost paid on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The scope is too broad, summarizing a timeline of months instead of grounding pressure in a single continuous scene or shard. Tension dissipates through montage, and the resolution (arrival) is a logistical outcome rather than a structural turn driven by a decisive choice or realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "floating rock arches" and "moss paths" are vivid, providing specific physical constraints that ground the rescue sequence effectively. The environment actively shapes the accident beat, though the "nebula" resolution feels less physically grounded and more magical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>High stakes (survival) are undercut because the solution is compliance with instructions rather than a protagonist-driven choice with a visible trade-off. The climax is resolved through competence and obedience, lacking a moment where the characters must sacrifice a want for a need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit dialogue ("tired together rather than tired alone") rather than emerging organically from the action. This sermonizing simplifies the narrative into a moral fable, reducing ambiguity and preventing earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The choral "we" voice is consistent but creates emotional distance, preventing deep engagement with the stakes. A jarring tense shift ("we reexamine") breaks the established past tense, disrupting the narrative spell and damaging authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lyrical density borders on purple prose ("gnarl our hope," "threaded... like a humble comet"), creating resistance rather than propulsion. The grammatical error in the final act ("reexamine" vs "reexamined") and repetitive list structures indicate a need for rigorous line-editing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the elements into a cohesive fable but relies on familiar "magical guide" tropes without a fresh subversion or specific emotional grit. The narrative trajectory is linear and predictable, lacking a conceptual risk or sharp reconfiguration of the premise.</comment>
