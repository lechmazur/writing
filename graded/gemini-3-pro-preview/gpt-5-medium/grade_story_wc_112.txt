<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Jae is a distinct, competent focalizer whose internal life drives the narrative. The "obliging" nature contrasts beautifully with the existential risk he takes, and the ending—where he accepts the secret of his own "sideways" existence—adds a layer of earned, distinct interiority that avoids stock heroism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal trajectory from the missing mantas to the experimental resolution. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: the proof of his theory arrives not just as data, but as a personal, existential echo (seeing himself), which satisfies the prompt's requirement for a felt/conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the ravine, the ozone-smelling vault, and the specific mechanics of the gantry constrain and enable the action. The "magnetic nexus" is grounded physically rather than remaining an abstract idea, anchoring the speculative elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure builds coherently through the mystery and the physical danger of the "surge tides." While the resolution is driven by competence, the lack of a sharper, more costly antagonist or a moment of potential failure keeps the stakes slightly lower than the highest band. The cost is largely internal and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "sideways time" is woven masterfully into the plot, transforming from a scientific theory into a resonant emotional truth about memory and existence. The final image of the protagonist seeing his "delayed self" offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central dramatic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, "icy warm" tone that suits the protagonist's perception. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly within Jae's competence and wonder without unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, but suffers from a high density of similes ("like a wish," "like early snow," "like oil," "like winter flags") that creates a repetitive syntactic cadence. This stylistic artifact occasionally draws attention away from the immediacy of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of migratory patterns existing in orthogonal time is a fresh, imaginative synthesis of biology and physics. The execution avoids standard genre tropes, offering a specific and memorable vision of a "sky mechanic's" work.</comment>
