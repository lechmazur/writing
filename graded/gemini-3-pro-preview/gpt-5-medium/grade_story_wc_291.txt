<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's condition (prosopagnosia) is effectively integrated into their methodology ("riverbeds," "postures"), creating a distinct worldview. However, the motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" feels asserted rather than embodied, and the character acts more as a thematic vessel than a person facing a costly struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The central deduction (blue ribbon implies identity swap) is a tenuous intuitive leap that strains causality, relying on "artist's magic" rather than evidence. The resolution depends on a convenient off-screen letter that confirms this theory, bypassing on-page dramatic confrontation or discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with high-resolution sensory detail ("clacked instead of sighed," "silt," "rust ladder") that anchors the abstract internal narration. The atmosphere of the quarry effectively mirrors the "furrowed hush" of the cold case.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the protagonist faces no active opposition or time pressure, merely the passive silence of the site. The conflict is internal interpretation, and the cost of the resolution is not felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through didactic mantras ("Unify the opposite," "awaken dormant empathy") rather than emerging organically from action. The moralizing conclusion simplifies complex grief into a tidy fable of forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, high-register tone. However, the density of metaphors occasionally distances the reader from the immediate reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from redundancy and metaphor overload ("glitter bruised to a dull bruise," "sound went quiet"). The reliance on poetic assertion sometimes obscures physical clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a face-blind artist solving cold cases through "posture" is fresh and engaging. The execution, while leaning on tropes of epistolary closure, offers a creative angle on the detective genre.</comment>
