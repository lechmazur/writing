<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "normality noticer" is a distinct, specialized observer, and the motivation is clear and consistent. However, the character functions primarily as a sensory instrument; they lack a deep internal crucible or high-stakes trade-off, which limits emotional complexity despite the strong voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "rule of three" structure (Accumulative lens) is executed cleanly, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist redefines "aliveness." The closure lands with a felt emotional cost ("weight of tiny vows"), though the linear progression is somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the specific sensory details (orris root, damp rope) ground the magical realism effectively. The environment actively constrains the investigation—the second house's resistance is a key beat driven by the setting's history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent but low-key, fitting the "quiet investigation" mode. The escalation comes from the varying responsiveness of the houses rather than urgent stakes; the conflict remains intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory residing in "pauses and put-backs" is coherent and touches the closure deeply. The final epiphany feels earned by the prior observations, though the density of the prose occasionally obscures the thematic through-line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but relies too heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("like a..."). While the perceptual signature is distinct, the relentless poetic density creates a sense of artificiality that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and simile fatigue (over 15 "like" constructions in a short text). While individual images are evocative, the density of figurative language chokes the narrative momentum and creates a rhythmic drone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of diagnosing houses via scent and object displacement is inventive and memorable. It successfully transforms the "haunted house" trope into a fresh exploration of memory and domestic rituals.</comment>
