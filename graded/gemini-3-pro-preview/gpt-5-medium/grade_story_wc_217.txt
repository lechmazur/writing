<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetypal "magical helper" with no internal conflict, flaws, or development; his stance is fully crystallized from the first line. The emotional calibration is too perfect, with the boy accepting the esoteric lesson immediately, lacking the resistance or "embodied contradiction" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative is a coherent vignette with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the boy's grief is reframed), but it lacks causal tension. The resolution comes through wise instruction rather than struggle, and the static nature of the POV character limits the structural impact of the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "lacquered leaves" and the "cobalt lagoon" create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that mirrors the theme. The setting effectively grounds the abstract action, though the description occasionally feels ornamental rather than constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes are relatively low and the conflict (the boy's grief) is resolved instantly by the poet's intervention without significant obstacles. The lack of pushback from the boy or cost to the poet results in a flat escalation arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing ("the song is richer in the torn places") rather than subtext. This "Thematic Echo," where characters articulate the thesis directly, reduces narrative resonance and feels didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is distinct and consistent, but "emotional ventriloquism" is pervasive; the narrator projects complex metaphors onto the boy's internal state ("distances inside his ribs"). Dialogue voices are not distinct; the boy speaks with the same poetic register as the narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, though metaphor density is high ("wicker lid from a sleeping basket"), approaching purple prose. The style is cohesive but draws attention to itself, occasionally slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the specific ritual of "woven dawns" offers some freshness, the core premise relies on the familiar "wise elder heals child's grief with nature metaphor" trope. The execution is competent but the underlying concept is safe and traditional.</comment>
