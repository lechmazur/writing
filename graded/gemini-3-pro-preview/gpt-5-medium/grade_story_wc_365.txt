<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s sensory-focused interiority ("maps are not lines, but scents") drives the narrative logic and emotional resolution flawlessly. The shift from investigator to perpetrator is handled with earned maturity, leading to a sophisticated integration of guilt that feels specific to this character's worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The investigation follows a clear causal path enabled by the shard, leading directly to the "redirect" revelation without stalling. Closure is secured via Conceptual Repricing: the map is no longer just a chart of space, but a vessel for the survivor's guilt and truth, creating a resonant final state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sensory details ("sleeping coolant," "heavy metal and rain") function as the specific clues for the protagonist's unique method, not just background. The setting actively participates in the story, holding the "residual photologs" and constraining the investigation to this specific traumatic geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake shifts seamlessly from the need to complete a map to the heavy burden of personal responsibility. The climax—realizing the child pressed the button—provides a decisive tightening of the narrative screw with visible, felt emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story navigates complex themes of memory, guilt, and maternal protection without heavy-handed exposition or moralizing. The final image of "weaving" the truth into a survival guide elegantly resolves the thematic tension, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and idiosyncratic, perfectly matching the "sensory map maker" persona with distinct rhythmic control. The transition between the technical observation of the multiverse and the emotional memory of the mother is fluid, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery is evocative and dense ("planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass") with high propulsion. The repetition of the specific phrase "cyclically spontaneous" works as a rhythmic motif but remains slightly visible as a structural artifact; otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of using sensory consistency to navigate parallel universes is a fresh, specific take on multiverse tropes. The emotional grounding of the high-concept mechanic in a moment of childhood error gives it distinct weight and avoids generic sci-fi pitfalls.</comment>
