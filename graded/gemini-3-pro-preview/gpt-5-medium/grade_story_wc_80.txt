<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") and the "Stoically sensitive" trait is inserted as a backstory nickname rather than dramatized through pressure. Motivation is stated explicitly ("I did not come merely to measure") rather than revealed through friction or high-stakes choices. The character feels like a vessel for the prose’s themes rather than a person with contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is legible, with the surveyor entering, working, and leaving in a clear sequence. However, the narrative lacks a causal spine or meaningful turning point; the progression is linear and predictable. Closure is achieved through a thematic statement rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the scene’s reality or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "lace of arches veiled by green water" and "carp listening like patient archivists." The submerged pavilion feels tactile and grounded. However, some imagery strains for effect (the lighthouse simile), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>There is negligible pressure or opposition; the river "loosens its grip" and the water "calms," removing external threats early. The physical obstacles (rusted door, stuck cabinet) are overcome easily, and there are no visible stakes or costs associated with failure. The narrative observes rather than struggles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is over-articulated, culminating in a final note that explicitly explains the story's thesis ("not to repair the past but to map its living gaps"). This direct moralizing in the final beats collapses subtext and robs the reader of interpretive work. The concepts are named ("Interlaced absence") rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a melancholic, high-lyric tone throughout. While effective for the mood, it risks monotony and feels somewhat affected ("chains flowered locks"). The voice holds the "surveyor" persona well but lacks emotional range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is overly dense with figurative language, triggering the density penalty; nearly every noun is modified by a metaphor or personification ("tripod coughs," "wind... reluctant broom," "lighthouse shutting its eye"). While some images land, the relentless density clutters the reading experience and draws attention to the writing itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise of a surveyor in a drowned city is evocative, but the execution relies heavily on inserting prompt elements as capitalized terms or explicit labels. The result feels like a formulaic response to a checklist rather than an organic synthesis of the required elements.</comment>
