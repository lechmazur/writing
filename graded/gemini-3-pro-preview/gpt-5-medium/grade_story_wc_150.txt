<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation is abstract ("restore lost faith") and interiority relies on diagnostic metaphors ("ache that never quite cleared its throat") rather than embodied contradiction or choice under pressure. The protagonist faces no genuine crucible; the "choice" to rebuild is cooperative and frictionless, lacking the conflicting impulses or visible cost required for high-band characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear "healing" arc that lacks causality or cost; the resolution feels inevitable and unearned. Closure lands as "symmetric satisfaction" where the environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's desires, and the "cost" of the reconfiguration is purely asserted rather than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" is a vivid, constrained environment that drives the imagery (roots, bones) and physically yields the plot objects. However, descriptions often drift into abstraction ("starlings circled like punctuation") or cliché ("dew jeweled") rather than sticking to sensory grounding that pressures the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal throughout; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, Sami, or the task. The repair process is smooth, lacking the friction, trade-offs, or narrowing of options required to generate dramatic stakes or earn the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative explicitly interprets itself for the reader ("It was not erasing history but repairing..."), reducing subtext to zero. The ending relies on sermonizing ("faith could be rebuilt... by walking with it") rather than allowing the theme to resonate through image and action alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent in its lyrical tone but maintains a safe, poetic distance that feels "writerly" rather than lived. The narrator frequently lapses into diagnostic label-speak ("purposeful wandering," "hours lost their anchor") that overlays the experience with immediate analysis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from "Simile-itis," with a repetitive cadence of observation followed by a "like/as" comparison ("like punctuation," "like a held breath," "like a migrating bird," "like a bell"). This figurative clutter distances the reader, and phrases like "dew jeweled" are tired clichés that weaken the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept of the "bone orchard" is inventive and visually striking, but the "diaspora healing" arc follows a safe, low-risk trajectory without subverting expectations. The execution lacks the specific, hard-won insights that would elevate the premise beyond a standard healing trope.</comment>
