<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is a compelling archetype with a distinct worldview ("empirically whimsical"), fitting the fable-like mode. However, interiority leans heavily on philosophical abstraction ("doubt is luminous") rather than embodied emotion or deep internal conflict. The character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a vulnerable individual making high-cost choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic structure, moving smoothly from the ridge to the hollow to the resolution. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the island's dependence on the narrator shifts. The causality follows dream logic ("hibiscus behaved like archivists"), which works for the genre, though the lack of significant obstacles makes the outcome feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, active, and integral to the plot; the specific geography of the "sleeping ear" hollow constrains the climax. Sensory details are lush ("petals debate," "red rain"). The score is capped at 8.8 per the global gate because the closure (Q2) does not reach the 9.0 threshold of visible cost required to unlock higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The approaching monsoon provides clear, coherent pressure that forces the ritual's timing. However, the conflict is largely external (Man vs. Nature/Entropy) with little friction in the execution; the protagonist and Iru perform the steps without a moment of genuine peril or hard trade-off, limiting the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving truth through "luminous doubt" is woven tightly into the narrative logic and imagery. The concept of memory as a "reef of stories" is resonant. The thematic execution borders on didactic at times ("luminous doubt made space for careful courage"), but the final image of the tree effectively anchors the abstract ideas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and consistently lyrical, perfectly matching the "reality checker" persona. The "empirically whimsical" tone is maintained throughout without slipping. The voice controls the surreal elements well, though it occasionally prioritizes poetic cadence over narrative immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, the density of figurative language is relentless ("jurors," "rumor," "archivists," "bruise," "fist," "commas" all appear as metaphors/similes). This constant stylization creates a "purple" texture that distances the reader from the physical action. The metaphor saturation borders on overwriting, obscuring the scene's mechanics in favor of ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "fantasy island reality checker" using empirical whimsy is highly original and imaginatively executed. The synthesis of bureaucracy and myth is fresh. The score is capped at 8.8 because the closure (Q2) does not meet the 9.0 cost requirement, despite the conceptual brilliance.</comment>
