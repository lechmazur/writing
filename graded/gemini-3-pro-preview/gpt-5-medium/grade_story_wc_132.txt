<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is clearly defined, but her development occurs through summary and montage rather than a pressurized scenic crucible. The pivotal shift in her character—from controller to listener—is narrated as a smooth realization ("She listened, finally") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible resistance or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies on a wide-scope montage ("On the morning," "Nights brought," "Soon the town") that violates the short-story scope without mastering the mosaic form. The resolution lacks cost; when she releases control, the plants immediately flourish ("it was not a tangle but a treaty"), removing all narrative tension and risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric and lyrical, with strong sensory anchoring in the nursery ("smell of runoff and tin," "mossy trellis"). While the timeline drift prevents deep immersion in a single moment, the textural consistency of the setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict dissipates rather than resolves; the opposition (the storm and the plants' wildness) capitulates instantly once Mara changes her mindset. The lack of a "bad outcome" or sacrifice—no plants die, the town applauds her—renders the stakes theoretical rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story descends into explicit moralizing, particularly during the town hall speech where the protagonist verbally summarizes the theme ("care can be a subtraction"). This "sermonizing ending" flattens the subtext and violates the show-don't-tell principle of thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished in a fable-like mode, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("questions raw as bark"). The narrative distance is managed well, keeping close to Mara’s perception, even if the summary mode creates an emotional buffer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from simile density ("like second thoughts," "like a map," "like damp clothes," "like a sullen apprentice," "like a sapling"), which creates a scaffolding effect that distances the reader. The reliance on "like" constructions weakens the immediacy of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of a gardener learning to let go of control is a familiar trope. While the execution is competent, the story hits the expected beats without subverting the archetype or offering a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the material.</comment>
