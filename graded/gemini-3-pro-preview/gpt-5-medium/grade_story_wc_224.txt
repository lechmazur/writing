<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict regarding their accent and buried talents provides a strong emotional anchor. However, the character remains somewhat reactive to the Seer's instructions, and the "shame-encyclopedias" moment feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully embodied in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, following a clear accumulation of magical logic toward a resonant reconfiguration. The causality of the ritual (feather/stone leads to memory, seeding leads to structural shift) holds together well under the magic realism frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, acting as a dynamic character that breathes, shifts, and reacts to the protagonist's internal state. The "ivy made of pages" and "aisles curling into cul-de-sacs" vividly constrain the movement and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the internal cost of "buried talents" is felt, but the external pressure is mild; the mountain "approves" readily, and the ritual's price (stinging feather) offers low resistance. The resolution feels slightly smooth, lacking a moment of desperate trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming identity is powerful, but the ending succumbs to explicit summary ("I understood that home was not a dwelling but a practice"). This telling deflates the resonance of the final image by explaining the subtext directly to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, suiting the genre perfectly. The control of tone is strong, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into aphorism ("Your rooms are the feelings you refuse to name") that feels slightly staged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("letters swam like minnows"). The imagery is inventive without becoming cluttered, maintaining a strong rhythmic propulsion throughout the ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a mountain-as-bookstore is fresh and well-executed. While the "magical mentor guides a healing ritual" frame is familiar, the specific synthesis of the lost accent and the seeding metaphor provides a distinct and creative angle.</comment>
