<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, with the tension between mechanical obedience and grief driving the narrative arc. The decision to leave the station and the subsequent realization at the shelter constitute a meaningful change in stance (Earned Stasis/Acceptance) with visible emotional cost. The connection to Mara feels authentic and anchors the surreal elements in human loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, following a clear Accumulative logic from construction to quest to epiphany. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the concept of "reverse migration" changes the protagonist's relationship to their duty and grief. The return to the station feels earned rather than cyclic, carrying the weight of the journey's insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as a constraint and a character; the station’s behavior (shivering, pointing) and the landscape (salt pans, feral gardens) actively shape the navigator’s choices. The integration of specific tools like the censer foot into the geography creates a unique, tangible atmosphere. The environment feels lived-in and inextricably linked to the plot's progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is primarily internal and situational, driven by the completion of the device and the compulsion to follow it. While external obstacles are minimal, the emotional pressure mounts effectively as the navigator nears the site of trauma. The stakes—navigating the void of loss—are clear and resolved through the final conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of mapping loss rather than recovering the lost is profound and rigorously developed through the central metaphor of the compass. The concept of "reverse migration" is not just a label but the structural logic of the ending. The final image of the needle settling "in the loss itself" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the narrative question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical intensity and a melancholic, technical register ("patchwork navigator," "choreography of screws"). The perspective is stable and deeply filtered through the character's specific grief and expertise. A strong, cohesive performance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, but suffers from a high frequency of "X like Y" similes (five distinct instances including "wounded animal," "match lit underwater," "bird relearning sky") which creates a repetitive cadence artifact. While the images are individually strong, the structural repetition draws attention to the writing itself, slightly slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes post-apocalyptic tropes with a metaphysical quest in a fresh way; the idea of a compass that points to memory/loss rather than magnetic north is inventive. The specific combination of technical assembly and mystical intuition feels original and avoids generic "searching for survivors" clichés.</comment>
