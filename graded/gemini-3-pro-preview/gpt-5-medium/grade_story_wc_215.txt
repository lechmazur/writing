<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously rendered, balancing the guilt of his former life ("broker of contracts") with his current penance. The contradiction between his instinct to survive and the necessity of accepting the "burning" frame drives a genuine psychological shift. His final choice to mark the sigil and accept the stings earns the transition from passive survivor to active custodian.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight and elegant, moving from established ritual to disruption (the Queen) to a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose. The causal link between his past negligence (pesticides/contracts) and his present burden grounds the fable-like logic. Closure is distinct and earned; the stasis at the end feels charged with new meaning rather than merely stopping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the "burnt hives" and "stained glass box" are not just scenery but the tools of the character's transformation. Sensory details like "scent like burnt sugar and rain" and "smoke colored the horizon a permanent bruise" create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the character, forcing the reliance on the box and the ghosts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arrival of the Ghost Queen introduces immediate, coherent pressure that forces the protagonist to confront the source of his guilt. The stakes are raised from mere observation to painful participation ("tolerable stings"), with a felt cost that validates the covenant. The tension holds steady under the Situational/Accumulative lens, resolving in a deepened commitment rather than a tidy victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of ecological grief intertwined with corporate culpability is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing in favor of "mute eloquence." The transition from storing "unspoken words" to preserving "heat" and "burning" beautifully complicates the concept of memory. The final image of language returning "with pollen on its mouth" offers a profound conceptual repricing of the archive's function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "fable" register without slipping into abstraction. The distinct perceptual signature—seeing the world through the lens of contracts and archives—remains stable. Narrative distance is managed perfectly, allowing access to his guilt while maintaining the mythic tone of the surroundings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Phrasing like "mosaicking silence into fragments of concentrated daybreak" risks being overwrought but lands successfully within the established lyric mode. The rhythm varies effectively between the quiet rituals and the tension of the Queen's arrival.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping imagery, corporate law atonement, and post-apocalyptic ghost story creates a unique and memorable premise. The specific invention of the "stained glass box" as a transformer of grief into light is ingenious. The story takes a familiar trope (the last survivor) and reinvigorates it through specific, non-obvious textural details.</comment>
