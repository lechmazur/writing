<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct, grounded in a specific "harmonic" craft that informs every observation. The internal motivation ("navigate without moving") is abstract but consistently dramatized through action (stillness, breathing). A stronger sense of personal cost or fallibility beyond mere patience would elevate the emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, layering sensory inputs to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration (abandoning the stones for the empty cord). The arc is clean, and the closure—a conceptual shift in how the character engages with the world—lands with earned weight. Orientation and pacing are expertly handled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic properties of the "ribs" and "canyon" actively constrain the magic system and the protagonist's choices. Sensory details like "scent of lichen" and "black mirror" seep create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the thematic focus on sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and conceptual; the struggle is against the difficulty of the task rather than an opposing force. While the tension of "tuning" is well-rendered, the lack of external pressure or a moment of genuine risk limits the dramatic engine. The escalation is textural rather than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "navigation through stillness" is woven tightly into the action and resolution without feeling sermonizing. The final image of the empty cord resonates with the premise, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The connection between tool and prayer adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent elevated register that suits the mythic tone. The perspective remains tightly filtered through the "stone skimmer's" specific expertise, interpreting the world through sound and vibration. Elision is purposeful and serves the mystical atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and imagery ("distances fold like paper boats"). However, the metaphor density is occasionally overwhelming, with synesthesia (scent of lichen as time, wings writing) sometimes cluttering the clarity of the beat. The line "sky that forgot how to be blue" leans toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "harmonic stone skimmer" using echoes to map a pulse is a fresh, specific synthesis of fantasy elements. The execution feels authentic to its own logic. While the "bone canyon" is a familiar trope, the sonic magic system revitalizes it successfully.</comment>
