<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist possesses distinct interiority and agency, acting as a competent "custodian" who uses professional skills to resolve the plot. The refusal of the tenure bribe is a character-defining choice with visible cost ("breakfast without chair"), grounding the cosmic conflict in personal integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc from discovery to confrontation and resolution. While the closure is decisive and resonant, the town's rapid de-escalation ("asked for pancakes") feels slightly too convenient given the weight of the preceding tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional; the tactile details of the radio station ("mittens against the cold," "tea-stained charts") ground the ethereal elements. The juxtaposition of technical gear with cosmic imagery ("mixer lights like stars") creates a unique, lived-in setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate logically from professional bureaucratic pressure to a supernatural threat against free will. The climax centers on a meaningful choice, though the antagonist's defeat feels somewhat abrupt compared to the sophisticated buildup of the threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of human "messiness" and "breath" as a counter to orchestrated perfection is woven organically into the action. The story achieves resonance without preaching, ending on a powerful conceptual repricing of "neutrality."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly embodying the "celestial signal interpreter" persona. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining a noir-ish, observant tone that suits the midnight setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("Static had tempers," "silence had accents"), with high information density. A single tonal slip at the resolution ("pancakes") jars slightly against the established grit, but the overall line-level craft is professional and polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of "magic radio" tropes and cosmic horror, grounded in specific political anxieties. The image of mapping the campus grid onto astronomical charts is an ingenious, specific detail that elevates the premise.</comment>
