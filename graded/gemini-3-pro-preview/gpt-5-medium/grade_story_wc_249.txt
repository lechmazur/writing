<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to save Mira is compelling, and the acceptance of the "strangers" at the end marks a distinct shift in stance. However, traits like "quietly rebellious" are stated rather than dramatized through pressure, and the internal conflict regarding the donor memories is resolved with an assertion rather than a struggle, reducing the visceral weight of the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual to breakthrough to consequence with a clear closure effect (Mira wakes, reality reconfigured). While the "dream logic" of the garden works for the genre, the causal mechanism relies heavily on metaphor ("intention could tune stone") rather than concrete interaction, slightly softening the plot's mechanical rigor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is a vivid, integral setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's ritual. Sensory details—knuckles chiming, leafed speakers, the auric lagoon—effectively ground the surreal medical concepts in a tangible, atmospheric reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira’s consciousness versus the loss of self—is clear and urgent. The escalation involving the intrusion of donor memories forces a tangible trade-off (accepting the "strangers"), though the antagonist force remains largely environmental and the cost is paid with relatively swift acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of integration—healing by accepting the foreign parts of oneself—is seamlessly woven into the sci-fi premise. The ending resonates well, reframing the "side effect" of the treatment as a new form of connection and "music" rather than a tragedy to be fixed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is highly consistent, distinct, and elevates the material with a lyrical, synesthetic quality. However, the unrelenting poetic register ("hush of the universe inhaling") occasionally creates a layer of aesthetic distance that buffers the reader from the immediate physical stakes of the hospital environment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from high metaphor density in peak beats (e.g., "silence had been folded too often," "light tasting of unread letters"). This aesthetic richness slows narrative propulsion and risks obscuring the action during the climax, trading clarity for poetic effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic memory manipulation and a "sound garden" as a medical tool is fresh and imaginative. The specific synthesis of grief, sound engineering, and shared consciousness creates a unique texture that feels distinct from standard medical sci-fi tropes.</comment>
