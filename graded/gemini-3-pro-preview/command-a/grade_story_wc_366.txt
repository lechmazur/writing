<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on adjectives ("reticent," "warmly observant") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's role is confused—he is a "supply skipper" yet acts as a live-in keeper sorting wicks—and his emotional pivot from confusion to resolve is instantaneous and unearned, lacking internal conflict or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Causality collapses at the pivotal moment: Elias rearranges the stones (2-3-1) with no on-page logic or clue, solving the puzzle via convenient authorial fiat. The conflict ("warning") is resolved by simply relighting the lamp, failing to address the established threat or the "haunted" nature of the disturbance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic lighthouse tropes (jagged cliffs, crashing waves) without specific, lived-in detail. The "hidden compartment" functions as a video-game mechanic rather than an integrated part of the environment, and the "haunted" aspect is reduced to a vague chill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract and low-pressure; the directive to "protect the light" lacks a concrete antagonist or immediate threat. The resolution—deciding to safeguard secrets—comes without sacrifice, trade-off, or visible cost, rendering the victory hollow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the letter ("To bottle the feeling of safety...") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending offers a summarized moral that feels unearned by the preceding action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The voice is competent but nondescript, relying on standard syntax and pacing. The POV filter is inconsistent; it claims the protagonist is "warmly observant" but fails to demonstrate unique perceptual details, settling for clichés.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by "fiction diction" and purple phrasing ("luminescent ache," "sentinel," "relentless sea"). Metaphors like "sinking into him like an anchor" are stock images that add little freshness or density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise is highly derivative, combining a standard lighthouse setting with a "hidden message" puzzle that lacks novelty. The execution relies on familiar tropes (cryptic notes, secret compartments) without subverting or deepening them.</comment>
