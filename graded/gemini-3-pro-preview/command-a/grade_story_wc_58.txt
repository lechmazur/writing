<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a narrative device rather than a character with internal conflict or risk; her "satchel was light" mirrors the lack of personal stakes. Emotional calibration is too perfect, with the "healing" interaction proceeding without the friction or misunderstanding that reveals depth. The secondary character is a stock figure of grief who offers no resistance, making the protagonist's journey purely functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and achieves a form of Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression relies on a linear, low-resistance path where the premise's "magic" works instantly. Causality is soft; the transition from stranger to intimate healer happens without earned trust or accumulated pressure. The ending provides closure but feels mechanically tidy rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shadowed garden" and "autumn leaves" provide a coherent atmosphere but rely on generic literary signifiers ("golden patches," "whispered conversations") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the mood rather than an active force that constrains the characters' choices or tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the woman accepts the traveler immediately, and the "obituary" resolves years of grief in a single beat. The lack of an antagonist or internal obstacle means there is no escalation of pressure, resulting in a flat narrative drive where the outcome feels inevitable from the moment of arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("testament to the power of being seen") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending serves as a moralizing summary ("story of absences explained") that flattens the ambiguity of the premise into a tidy lesson, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining the emotional significance of actions ("intimate," "sacred space") instead of letting them stand alone. The tone is overly reverent, which creates a distance that prevents visceral engagement with the characters' pain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose leans heavily into "purple" description and clichés ("dissolving... like a memory," "quiet intrusion," "quiet hymn"). Adjective density slows the rhythm without adding information ("vivid reminder," "lonesome splendor"), and the reliance on abstract nouns ("geography of healing") weakens the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core concept of writing obituaries for the living is distinct and promising, but the execution retreats into a safe, sentimental mode. The story avoids the risks of its premise—what if the obituary was rejected? what if the description was wrong?—settling instead for a comfortable, expected resolution.</comment>
