<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by a high-concept label ("gossip-column exorcist") that never influences her actions or perspective on the page. Motivation is summarized as abstract regret rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific memories. The emotional resolution feels unearned because the character's internal struggle is resolved instantly by magic rather than a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path to a "soft reset" ending where a magical action resolves the central emotional problem without cost. The story lacks a true turning point; the protagonist enters wanting to apologize and simply does so. The causality is purely mechanical (she channels energy, problem solved), missing the complexity required for a literary resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setting descriptions rely heavily on received phrases ("aged paper," "whispered secrets," "flickering lamp") rather than specific, sensory observation. The "sheet music archive" feels disconnected from the perfume bottle and orchard, serving as a generic backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the scene. Specificity is low, with the environment fading into atmospheric fuzz.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal hesitation in performing the ritual. The looming demolition of the orchard provides atmospheric background but does not force a trade-off or tighten the protagonist's options. The stakes remain theoretical, as the solution is available and effective from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit, aphoristic dialogue ("Miracles aren’t perfect") and summary rather than subtextual development. The ending creates a tidy moral lesson ("heart lighter than it had been in years") that flattens the complexity of grief and estranged relationships. The result is didactic, telling the reader exactly what the story means.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama and purple phrasing ("hum with a life of its own," "scent blooming like a ghostly flower"). While grammatically controlled, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, sounding like a generic omniscient narrator rather than a "gossip-column exorcist."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prose is functional but saturated with clichés ("lingered like smoke," "held breath," "whispered secrets," "wrapped around her like a shawl"). These "scaffold" phrases reduce the story's vividness and impact. The density of stock metaphors prevents the imagery from achieving the freshness required for high-band literary work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The potentially unique premise of a "gossip-column exorcist" is wasted, appearing only as a title in a standard sentimental healing narrative. The story relies on familiar tropes of magical heirlooms and ghostly forgiveness without subverting them or adding a specific, gritty reality. The execution is safe and predictable.</comment>
