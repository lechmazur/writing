<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's defining trait ("religiously skeptical") is a label that dissolves instantly without internal struggle; she accepts supernatural intuition ("knew this artifact... a release") without evidence. "Reckless" is stated but contradicted by her cautious movement and lack of risky choices. The character serves the plot rather than driving it through consistent psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Closure relies on a "magic button" solution (turning the wheel instantly fixes the ghosts) with zero felt or conceptual cost, violating the high-end requirement for consequence. Causality breaks when Mara possesses unearned knowledge about the wheel's specific supernatural function. The narrative follows a video-game logic (find key, insert key, win) that lacks literary weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting relies on "abandoned place" starter-pack tropes (damp earth, rusted metal, flickering flashlight) rather than specific, singular details. While functional for orientation, the environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's tactical options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Escalation is purely sensory (louder noises, lunging shadows) rather than a tightening of choices; the protagonist faces no dilemma or trade-off. The resolution is mechanical and instantaneous, bypassing the need for a decisive, costly act of agency. Conflict evaporates rather than resolving through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme of "swallowed truth" is repeated as a phrase but never dramatized; the ending offers a platitude ("found her truth") rather than earned resonance. The shift from skepticism to belief is treated as a plot toggle rather than a thematic exploration of faith or grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice leans heavily on clichés ("air hung heavy," "silent witness," "frozen in time") that distance the reader. Filter verbs ("she couldn't shake the feeling," "she realized") dilute immediacy. The tone feels manufactured rather than emerging from the character's distinct perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Competent mechanics, but the prose suffers from stock phrasing ("shadows that danced like spectral figures") and a lack of rhythmic variety. The "drowsy alertness" insertion creates a jarring tonal contradiction with the established tension. Information density is low, with sentences often restating the atmosphere without advancing the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The premise—finding an object to put a restless spirit to rest—is a standard genre trope executed without a fresh angle or subversion. The literal interpretation of the "ghost shift" and the convenient resolution lack the ingenuity required for a prestigious venue.</comment>
