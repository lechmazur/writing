<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on labels ("wisely adventurous," "unyielding curiosity") rather than dramatized choice. Interiority is generic ("heart quickened"), and there is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse to drive the narrative; she functions solely as a vehicle for the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear video-game logic (find clue, unlock door, claim prize) without unexpected causal turns. The closure fails the cost requirement; the realization is an abstract reward ("fulfillment") rather than a paid price, and the "sally" sequence breaks physical causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting is described with heavy, generic adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "bioluminescent," "surreal") rather than specific, grounded interaction. The environment functions as a backdrop for puzzles rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("until sunrise") but never tested; the protagonist meets every obstacle with the immediate, correct solution. There is no escalation of pressure or meaningful tightening of options, resulting in a flat trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The ending explicitly states the moral ("throne was not meant to be claimed... by the collective wisdom"), violating the prohibition against sermonizing. The theme is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging from the conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generic fantasy with little distinct texture or rhythmic control. The usage of "sally" ("sally through the peel of paint") is jarringly incorrect, disrupting the narrative distance and credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose is laden with clichés ("weight of history," "countless trials," "blinding point of light"). The forced inclusion of "sally" creates a semantic break, and the imagery often leans into purple abstraction rather than concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on stock tropes: the hidden waterfall, the ancient trial, and the "treasure was the journey" ending. There is no fresh synthesis or subversion of these familiar elements.</comment>
