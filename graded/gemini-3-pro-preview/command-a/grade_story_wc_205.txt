<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies on resume-style labels ("defunct revolutionary," "poetically inclined") rather than dramatized behavior or specific micro-choices. Emotional beats are stock ("tears streamed"), and interiority is summarized exposition rather than embodied experience under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene; the heist proceeds without on-page obstacles or complications. Causality is linear but lacks the friction of a "try/fail" cycle, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Settings are established with heavy adjectival strings ("gilded spires," "obsidian canals") rather than tactile interaction or spatial constraints. The Hall of Reflections remains a generic backdrop that does not pressure the character's movements or tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Immediate opposition is absent; the antagonist faction is purely theoretical background, and the storm presents no physical danger. The stakes never tighten because the protagonist faces no active resistance or narrowing of options during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through didactic explanation ("concept she called 'temporal plasticity'") and explicit moralizing at the end. Subtext is replaced by direct statements of meaning, leaving no room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, prioritizing world-building exposition over the character's immediate sensory reality. Despite the protagonist's "poetic" trait, the narration remains standard and functional without distinct rhythmic or lexical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from frequent clichés ("fever pitch," "tears streamed," "unravel secrets") and purple abstractions ("torrents of luminescence"). The reliance on summary creates a lack of momentum and density in the line-level work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the core concept of visible time is intriguing, the execution follows a predictable "vindicated scholar" template. The resolution offers no structural surprise or subversion of the established tropes.</comment>
