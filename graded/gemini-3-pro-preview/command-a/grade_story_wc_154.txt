<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract labels ("shrewdly innocent," "pacific") rather than demonstrated behavior. Motivation is declared ("to graft new meaning") but not tested by difficult choices; the protagonist observes and succeeds without internal cost or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist faces no obstacles in the central task. A significant logic break occurs when the protagonist uses "deft" fingers despite a wrist numbed by anesthetic, disrupting physical credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospherically described ("mist-clad," "condensation") but remains a static backdrop. The environment does not constrain the character's actions or force tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("weight of what she was about to do") but never operationalized; the decoding process is frictionless and inevitable. There is no active opposition or escalation of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly told to the reader ("symbol of resilience," "pain that bloomed into purpose") rather than emerging from action. The ending moralizes rather than resonating through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but heavily filtered and sentimental ("innocence felt like a liability"). Narrative distance is close, but the internal monologue relies on flowery abstraction rather than specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose is overwritten and adjective-heavy ("fragile peace," "jagged edges," "lotus-hearted ache"), creating a "purple" texture. The repetition of the opening phrase at the end feels mechanical rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The specific prompt elements (brain coral, cast) are novel, but they are embedded in a generic, sentimental narrative about war and healing that lacks fresh insight or grit.</comment>
