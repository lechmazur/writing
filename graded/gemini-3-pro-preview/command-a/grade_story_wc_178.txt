<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Traits are applied as static labels ("frugal," "empirically ironic") rather than demonstrated through high-stakes choices. The protagonist faces no internal friction or genuine cost, resulting in a flat character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The plot relies on extreme convenience, such as the protagonist simply "brushing against" the hidden tile, and lacks a decisive change with felt cost. The progression is linear and resistant-free.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is asserted through the repetitive insertion of the phrase "dusky harmony" rather than evoked via sensory details. The setting lacks specific spatial grounding or interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist encounters no external opposition or internal barriers, resulting in a narrative without tension or escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Themes are delivered through repetitive, abstract summaries ("encrypted devotion") rather than dramatized experience. The story explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly explanatory and disrupts immersion by forcing prompt phrases ("empirically ironic") into the text without distinct POV coloring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Heavy repetition of prompt phrases ("dusky harmony," "covenant," "schematic representations") constitutes significant text artifacting and looping, damaging flow and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The narrative relies on standard "ancient puzzle" tropes without offering a specific, fresh take on the setting or character. The resolution is generic.</comment>
