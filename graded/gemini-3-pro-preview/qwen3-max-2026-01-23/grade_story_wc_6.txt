<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on label-only feelings ("unyielding compassion," "grace born of vigilance") rather than embodied emotion or internal struggle. The protagonist arrives with a resolved duality ("sought to harmonize") and executes a plan without hesitation, lacking the contradictory impulses required for depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear execution of a ritual with clear sequencing but low causality and negligible pressure. Closure is achieved through a symbolic act (burying the coin) that feels like "Earned Stasis," but the lack of resistance or meaningful tightening makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid but often filtered through abstract metaphors ("drifting like memories," "whispered apology") rather than concrete observation. Phrases like "scented of... resilience" break the physical reality of the setting, prioritizing poetic affect over grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or active internal resistance during the scene. The stakes are abstract ("legacy," "shame") and are not tested by a concrete on-page threat or difficult choice, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statements and moralizing ("Healing isn't hiding the scar") rather than subtext or action. The symbolism of every object is explained immediately, reducing the narrative to a didactic parable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from significant overwriting and a tendency toward melodrama ("compassion so deep it felt like gravity"). The high poetic register creates distance, making the narration feel like a performance of profundity rather than an intimate perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense with abstract metaphors and "purple" phrasing that violates the "show, don't tell" principle ("scented of resilience," "liquid strokes"). This density of figurative language distracts from the action and reduces line-level propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the specific ritual elements (grafting, Chilean peso) add texture, the core narrative is a generic "healing journey" trope. The lack of subversion or gritty reality makes the story feel like a standard response to a prompt rather than a fresh artistic vision.</comment>
