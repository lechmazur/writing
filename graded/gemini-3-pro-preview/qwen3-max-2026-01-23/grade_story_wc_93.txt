<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal landscape is described rather than dramatized; emotions are signaled through stock physical cues ("tears welling," "single tear"). While her motivation is clear, the "elusive" trait is told via exposition rather than demonstrated in scene dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with a clear objective and a resonant closure (restoration of friction). The inciting incident is routine maintenance, and the central obstacle (the curse's vision) is resolved somewhat easily via "breath and purpose," lowering tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The physical constraints of a frictionless world are used effectively (magnetic boots, pebbles drifting). The atmosphere is strong, though occasionally the description favors poetic abstraction ("borrowed dawn") over concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stakes are high globally but the immediate scene pressure is low; the "vision of failure" provides only momentary resistance. The resolution feels inevitable, and the cost (dimming aurora) is external/resource-based rather than a visceral personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in the text ("not domination, but invitation to harmony," "creation demanding sacrifice") rather than emerging through subtext. This didactic approach flattens the potential for interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent—elevated and mythic—fitting the fable-like quality. However, the tone remains somewhat distant, and the reliance on high-register phrasing keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose leans on adjective-heavy construction and stock imagery ("liquid mercury," "inner fire"). The climax relies on the "single tear" cliché, and phrases like "thermal sighs" strain for poetic effect without adding precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a frictionless world restored by math is imaginative and fresh. However, the execution falls into standard fantasy ritual tropes (chanting, glowing stones, a hum), which dilutes the novelty of the setup.</comment>
