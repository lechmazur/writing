<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Aris functions primarily as a competent operator of the magic system rather than a character with deep internal contradictions; his "kitchen discipline" resolves the central struggle too smoothly, making his success feel inevitable rather than earned through character-specific cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, linear process of discovery and resolution. While closure is achieved through the transmutation of remorse, the arc lacks a significant setback or moment of doubt, resulting in a procedural feel rather than high dramatic pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details regarding taste (metallic abandonment, salt-tears) effectively ground the fantastical elements. However, some visual descriptors ("bruised twilight," "liquid sky") lean toward ornamental "purple" prose rather than purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "perilous" nature of the contagion is stated but not dramatically tested; Aris encounters the pain and immediately resolves it with his skills. The stakes flatten because the threat of "flooding his spirit" never forces a difficult trade-off or near-failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of processing trauma is coherent but handled explicitly. The final paragraph summarizes the moral ("preserving lesson without wound") rather than allowing the imagery to carry the resonance, triggering a deduction for explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by the tautological phrasing "emotions were emotionally contagious," which disrupts immersion. The register occasionally drifts into overwrought adjectival density ("crystalline sorrow").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Significant line-level flaws exist, including the redundancy "emotions were emotionally contagious" and the repetitive use of the "sandpaper" metaphor (three times). The metaphor density mixes vehicles (cartography, sandpaper, cooking, glass) to the point of clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "memory chef" utilizing culinary techniques to process emotional trauma is imaginative and synthesizes the elements well. However, the execution follows a standard, low-risk healing vignette pattern.</comment>
