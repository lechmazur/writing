<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is consistent but lacks internal conflict; her past as an insurgent is stated rather than demonstrated through tactical grit in the present. The dismissal of the "innocent child" constraint with a mere scoff feels convenient, bypassing the potential for a hard-won character choice or genuine hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative is linear and frictionless, moving from discovery to resolution without setbacks or meaningful complications. The closure fails the cost requirement; the pine tree immediately validating her choice removes the risk of breaking tradition, leaving the happy ending unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "cracked obsidian" and "sulfur's sharp bite" effectively ground the scene in a tangible physical reality. The hot springs are integrated well as a necessary tool for the resolution, though the "reconstruction" context remains largely atmospheric rather than pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared but not felt; Elara faces no genuine opposition, resource scarcity, or possibility of failure. The central conflict—violating a sacred seal—is resolved instantly by environmental validation, stripping the climax of tension or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statement rather than subtext, particularly in the final paragraph's moralizing summary ("tradition evolved—rooted in respect"). The concept is told to the reader through exposition rather than emerging organically from a complex struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic but leans into distancing abstractions ("renewal's damp promise") that mute the immediacy. The transition from grim insurgent to nurturing healer is smooth, though the dialogue at the end feels didactic and stiff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose is functional but prone to overwriting ("ghostly plumes," "broken constraints") and emotional clichés like "tears streamed... not of sorrow, but vindication." Sentences often summarize emotional states with labels instead of evoking them through specific action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the prompt elements competently but relies on standard fantasy tropes, such as the chosen elder and the convenient prophecy loophole. The "insurgent grandmother" angle is a fresh setup that unfortunately resolves into a generic, low-risk healing arc.</comment>
