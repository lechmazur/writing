<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias is a consistent, well-rendered archetype of the stoic maritime figure. The interiority effectively bridges his "reticent" nature with the "warmly observant" trait through specific notices (the teacup, dust). However, the motivation remains somewhat idealized and static; he faces no internal temptation to abandon the task, making his nobility feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building toward the ritual closure of the "Phoenix Stack." The closure lands with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. A minor causality gap exists: the urgency of the "lamp out" scenario is sidestepped for the symbolic ritual, creating a slight disconnect between his role as a skipper/protector and his actions as a poet/philosopher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is the story's strongest asset, using sensory specifics like "cold brass," "dust motes," and "cobalt blue" to anchor the abstraction. The setting actively participates in the ritual, though some descriptors ("spectral rainbows," "forgotten promises") veer into lush over-description that risks distancing the reader from the gritty reality of the tower.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stakes are purely internal and thematic (preserving legacy) rather than visceral; the external crisis (dark reefs) creates a backdrop of danger that the protagonist does not directly engage. The lack of obstacles—the stones are ready, the ritual goes smoothly, no physical impediment arises—keeps the narrative tension low, relying entirely on the solemnity of the mood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of continuity through silent action is coherent and resonant, effectively encapsulated in the stone metaphor. However, the text tends to explicate its themes ("Care outlasts absence," "words are wind"), leaving little room for subtextual discovery. The ending successfully lands the emotional argument, even if the delivery is slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated register appropriate for the fable-like quality of the tale. While effective, the voice occasionally feels performative, leaning on "writerly" cadences ("measured in tides," "flickered its final breath") that smooth over the rougher edges of the character's lived experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from a density of stock literary metaphors ("heart heavy as fog," "silence... physical weight"). The line "danced like forgotten promises" is a notable instance of abstraction that weakens the visual immediacy. The craftsmanship is solid, but the reliance on familiar poetic tropes limits the freshness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse keeper passing a torch via a silent code is a familiar variation on the "isolated sentinel" trope. While the specific mechanism of the stone language adds a unique texture, the overall emotional trajectory and the character archetypes feel safe and traditional, lacking a sharp, unexpected subversion.</comment>
