<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris is a distinct protagonist whose professional expertise convincingly filters his grief. While the motivation to "prove empty spaces remember" is compelling, the specific trait "quietly explosive" is applied as a repetitive label rather than fully dramatized until the cathartic sob at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, using the sequence of clouds to structure the emotional arc effectively. The closure is a valid "Earned Stasis," though the perfect synchronization of weather phenomena with internal states relies heavily on pathetic fallacy, slightly straining causal credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the specificity of meteorological terms (altocumulus, fallstreak hole) grounds the abstract theme in concrete reality. The physical constraints of the gondola and the "velvet dark" atmosphere are vividly rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tension is primarily internal, sustained by the high stakes of the "tether snap" and the emotional weight of the project. While the external pressure is low—turbulence is brief and resolved by writing—the cost of the final "Peace" (surrendering rescue for connection) is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory residing in negative space is poignant and well-developed through the cloud metaphor. However, the story tends to state its subtext explicitly ("empty spaces did not forget"), reducing the ambiguity and resonance of the final realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical register that fits the solitary, scientific-poetic nature of the protagonist. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Aris's thoughts while maintaining the atmospheric scope of the sky.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished but suffers significantly from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases in the closure. The line "dusty starlight that dusted the heavens" is tautological, and the threefold repetition of "quietly explosive" reads as a scaffold artifact rather than organic characterization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of an aviation meteorologist mapping grief through cloud taxonomy is fresh and imaginative. The use of the "fallstreak hole" as the climactic image of absence-made-visible is a brilliant, specific choice that elevates the concept.</comment>
