<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the scene, anchoring Leo’s skepticism against his need for redemption. However, the emotional epiphany relies on summarized interiority ("visceral clarity," "crushing burden") rather than embodied reaction, and the realization feels slightly like an intellectual download.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causality is strong, with the inciting call leading directly to the discovery and recontextualization of the object. The closure (turning the wheel) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the scene functions more as verification of a known backstory than a discovery of new information, slightly lowering tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and specific, particularly the "cobalt-blue glass beads" and the "scent of wet stone." The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist’s internal state, grounding the "drowsy alertness" in the physical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The internal stakes—redeeming the grandfather’s legacy—are well-defined and felt. However, the external pressure is low; the tunnel offers atmosphere but no active opposition, making the climax a quiet confirmation rather than a high-pressure test of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the "ghost shift" as a pact of honor is compelling. However, the ending explicitly explains the theme ("it was the truth shift," "legacy of quiet courage"), converting subtext into text and reducing the resonant power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a serious, investigative tone. The shift from skepticism to reverence is handled well within the POV, though the vocabulary occasionally drifts into abstract summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent, but the phrase "swallowed truth" is repeated three times (opening, climax, resolution), creating a distracting lexical loop. Some filtering ("Leo’s breath hitched") and abstract phrasing dull the immediacy of the physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inversion of the industrial ghost story—where the haunting is actually a protective human act—is a fresh and poignant concept. The specific craftsmanship of the rosary beads on the valve wheel adds a unique, memorable tactile element to the trope.</comment>
