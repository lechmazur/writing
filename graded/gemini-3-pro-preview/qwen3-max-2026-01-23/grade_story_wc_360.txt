<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("visceral resonance," "transposed empathy") rather than specific, embodied reaction. The emotional arc resolves via a toggle-like epiphany ("Lucid turbulence") rather than an earned decision, lacking the "visible cost" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where an internal realization instantly dissolves the external threat (the disorientation ceases, a star appears). This "symmetric satisfaction" resolves complex pressure without a felt price or irrevocable change in the protagonist's situation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "topaz workshop" and "captured starlight" provide a vivid, consistent atmosphere that grounds the abstract premise. While effective, the descriptions occasionally drift into generic "purple" territory ("velvet blackness," "crystalline dome") rather than constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conflict remains abstract and internal; the "violent force" of the climax dissipates immediately upon the protagonist's realization. The external stakes (vanishing stars) function as a mirror to the internal state rather than a resisting force, resulting in low narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative sermonizes in the final paragraph ("printed not words, but wisdom"), explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from action. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by resolving ambiguity with a tidy moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, mediating the protagonist's experience through analysis ("Her method demanded deliberate ambiguity") rather than immediate sensory immersion. This distance reduces the impact of the "visceral encounter" the story promises.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished but dense with abstract nouns and "therapy-speak" labels in peak beats ("transposed empathy," "chaotic variable"). The reliance on telling ("Panic rose, metallic and sharp") over showing stalls momentum during the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of a letterpress operator in a dying cosmos is evocative, but the execution follows a standard "artisan finds inner balance" template. The resolution feels safe, avoiding the riskier, messier implications of the "irreducible complexity" it champions.</comment>
