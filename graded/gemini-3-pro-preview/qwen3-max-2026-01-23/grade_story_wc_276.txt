<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("allowed her grief... to surface") rather than embodied experience. The internal shift feels slightly convenient, transitioning from "cool-headed" to "raw" emotion without sufficient on-page pressure to earn the break.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist is "remade." The pacing is solid, though the resolution—peace washing over the garden—feels somewhat tidy ("healing light"), lacking a sharper, grittier cost to balance the ease of the fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is visualized with vivid, synesthetic detail that effectively constrains the protagonist's movement (the "zigzag"). While imaginative, some descriptions drift into abstraction ("celestial loom," "crystalline forests") that distance the reader from the physical danger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are established early, and the escalation of the garden's chaos provides coherent pressure. However, the resolution hinges on an internal release of emotion that feels slightly unearned by the external struggle, and the cost—giving up the "catch" for internal peace—is stated more than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief and healing is consistent but heavily underlined, particularly in the final paragraph which explicitly summarizes the moral ("song born of broken patterns and mended hearts"). This "sermonizing ending" flattens the subtext into a direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, it occasionally slips into expository telling ("The garden possessed a profound attribute") and repetitively uses the prompt's specific vocabulary ("transliterate") in a way that feels mechanical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent but marred by stock phrasing in pivotal moments ("tears welled unbidden," "broken heart," "fractured dream"). The repetition of "transliterate" and "feral lullaby" as labels rather than organic descriptors creates a scaffolded feel that lowers line-level quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a garden where sound solidifies is handled with specific, fresh imagery. While the emotional arc (grief heals the world) is a familiar trope, the synthesis of the rail spike and "voiced silence" mechanics adds a layer of ingenuity to the execution.</comment>
