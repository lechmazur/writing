<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("somatic echo," "integration") rather than embodied emotion, creating a clinical distance. The protagonist lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, as she resolves her trauma response with perfect efficiency using a "practiced method."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear "symptom-and-cure" structure that lacks causal pressure or meaningful turns. Closure is a soft landing into stasis (watering plants) achieved without visible cost or narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sensory details are present (salt spray, rough bark) but often serve as heavy-handed symbols explicitly decoded for the reader (e.g., the lighthouse explanation). The setting functions more as a thematic backdrop than a physical space that constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the external trigger (gull cry) is immediately neutralized by the protagonist's internal technique, removing all tension. There is no escalation, dilemma, or trade-off; the stakes remain abstract concepts rather than felt risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is stated explicitly ("anchor optimism in realism") multiple times rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story lectures the reader on its own meaning, preventing any organic resonance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is inconsistent, blending flowery prose with sterile therapy jargon ("somatic markers"). The clumsy, repetitive insertion of the phrase "quietly talented" (three times) disrupts the narrative flow and feels artificial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose is burdened by abstract nouns and telling, with significant repetition artifacts (the "realism/optimism" pairing and "quietly talented" recur mechanically). These repetitions stifle rhythm and highlight the checklist nature of the composition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story executes the prompt elements as a formulaic checklist without transforming them into a unique or specific vision. The "healing in nature" trope is handled generically, relying on familiar metaphors without a fresh angle or emotional risk.</comment>
