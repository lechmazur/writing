<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct and drives the central choice, but relies heavily on expository summary ("His motivation was crystalline") rather than dramatized desire. The protagonist's internal conflict is resolved with a coherent ethical choice (Earned Stasis), but the emotional texture is often reported ("agonized immediately") rather than embodied in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient, moving from a clear inciting incident (finding the tablet) to a decisive act of concealment. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the burden of silence. The structure works well as a vignette, though the stakes regarding the Council remain abstract and off-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the stratigraphy of the archive (ash, silt, clay) actively structures the narrative and grounds the protagonist's method. Atmospheric details like "abrasive calm" and "filtered water" effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state. The physical environment constrains the action and shapes the final decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake (preservation of truth) is signaled early and tested by the discovery of the tablet. However, the pressure remains largely internal and hypothetical, as the antagonist (Councilor Valerius) exists only in Kael's mind. The escalation is logical under a Situational lens, but the lack of immediate external friction limits the palpable tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of "truth as a seed" rather than a weapon is resonant and well-integrated into the closure. The distinction between the "surface narrative" and the "deep truth" is handled intellectually, though the thematic moralizing ("History showed truths arriving too early...") occasionally overrides subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a contemplative and precise tone that fits the "wannabe philosopher" persona. The vocabulary ("empirical," "sedimentary," "crystalline") reinforces the character's worldview. Narrative distance is stable, though it sometimes drifts into explaining the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally strong, but the text relies on abstract telling ("symbolized empirical truth," "rationally rebellious") over concrete showing. A paraphrase loop occurs with "counter-narrative" and "competing narrative" in close proximity. The "agony" beat is delivered as a label rather than a visceral experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The inversion of the typical archivist trope—choosing to hide knowledge rather than reveal it—is a fresh and thoughtful angle. The specific focus on hydrology and sedimentary layers adds a unique texture to the post-apocalyptic setting. The concept feels distinct, even if the execution leans on exposition.</comment>
