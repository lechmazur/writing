<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and the reverse-aging constraint is well-integrated into his worldview. However, interiority leans on diagnostic labeling of emotion ("peculiar cruelty," "overwhelming immediacy") rather than embodied sensation during peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively supports the meditative arc, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure. While the "spiral" trigger is slightly convenient, the internal logic of the realization holds together well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto and ripple mechanics are inventive and essential to the scene's progression. Specificity is marred by reliance on stock literary descriptors ("obsidian pond," "liquid silver," "star-dusted") rather than fresh observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the conflict is low-pressure and largely intellectual. The epiphany arrives through observation rather than a sharp, escalating test of agency, though the cost of withholding grief is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("The lesson... was complete: to teach vanishing..."), reducing resonance to a moral statement. This expository conclusion undermines the ambiguity required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, meditative, and appropriate for the academic protagonist. Narrative distance is controlled, with smooth transitions between the physical setting and internal memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm is competent, but the text relies heavily on cliché clusters ("luminous clarity," "liquid silver") and adjective stacking ("profound and gentle hush") that dilute the prose's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the reverse-aging trope with the specific divination mechanics of the magnetic pond offers a fresh, specific angle on the prompt's core concept.</comment>
