<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara has a distinct profession and goal, but her internal pivot—shifting from accusation to compassion—happens too smoothly without sufficient on-page resistance. The mentor character exists only as a vision, limiting the "relationship" dynamics to internal reflection rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure leads to a valid Conceptual Repricing of the past. However, the resolution relies on a "vision-dump" where the shard reveals the truth directly, rather than the protagonist deducing it through active sensory mapping, softening the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sensory details ("scent of rusted durasteel," "grit-strewn permacrete") are vivid and align well with the protagonist's skill set. The atmosphere is tangible, though the "parallel worlds" remain somewhat generic sketches compared to the repair bay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stakes are stated (oblivion) but the threat is resolved almost instantly by a shift in "intent," lacking visceral struggle. The antagonist is a misunderstanding, which is cleared up by the shard's revelation rather than a hard-won confrontation or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice is coherent but heavily moralized in the final paragraphs ("topography of grace," "anchor of profound, selfless love"). The story tells the reader exactly what the events mean, reducing subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a specialized vocabulary (durasteel, resonance, weave). However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("phantom light," "boots whispering") that distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable, but relies on adjective-heavy descriptions and some clichés ("tears tracing paths"). The integration of the required phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is awkward within the narrative flow, creating a minor stumble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "sensory map maker" concept adds a fresh layer to a standard sci-fi investigation. However, the "mentor sacrifice vs. sabotage" trope and the "empathy calms the energy storm" resolution are familiar genre beats without a significant twist.</comment>
