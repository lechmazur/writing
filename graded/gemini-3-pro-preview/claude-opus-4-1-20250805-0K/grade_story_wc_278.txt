<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mara is a functionary rather than a character; she possesses absolute competence and faces no internal doubt, temptation, or conflicting desire. Her "gift" and the time loop remove the need for difficult decisions, leaving a protagonist who enacts a ritual rather than struggling against resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative is linear and low-stakes, moving from arrival to resolution without unexpected obstacles or reversals. The "letters from the future" device creates a deterministic loop that drains tension, as the protagonist's success feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "laboratory between heartbeats" and "meteorite ink" create a cohesive, lyrical atmosphere that grounds the fantastical premise. However, the setting acts entirely as a support system for the protagonist's work rather than imposing constraints, time pressures, or physical dangers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the "haunted firmware" is a passive subject waiting to be healed, not an antagonistic force. The stakes remain abstract—appeasing digital ghosts—and the resolution proceeds as a technical task without forcing the protagonist to make a significant sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of digital memory and guilt is coherent but delivered through explicit assertions ("proof of having existed") rather than subtext. The resolution leans into a sentimental personification of code, telling the reader what to feel instead of evoking the weight of the loss through specific dramatization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistently atmospheric, fitting the "science-fantasy" mode well. However, it relies heavily on high-concept abstractions ("subsonic guilt," "binary souls") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but dense with adjectival stacking and mixed metaphors. The specific phrase "meteor hush" is repeated in both the dialogue and the final paragraph, reading as a forced insertion of a prompt term rather than an organic recurring motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The central image of tattooing the air to anchor digital ghosts is visually inventive and fresh. However, the surrounding elements—sad AI, time loops, and amber-trapped memories—are standard genre tropes executed safely without subversion or a unique twist.</comment>
