<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and specific, grounding Mari's ghost-like existence in concrete sensory details ("texture of her mother's last words"). While motivation is clear, the character lacks active resistance or sharp contradictory impulses under pressure; her acceptance of "dissolution" creates a somewhat static emotional arc, though the final affirmation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds firmly, building density through discovered journals to the final signature. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (joining the collective), though the transition "As weeks passed" relies on summary to bridge the gap between discovery and the spring tide climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment actively constrains the protagonist—tides dictate physical access to the labyrinth—and charges the final image. Sensory details like "echo patterns" and the "drowned quiet" are vivid, purposeful, and tightly woven into the narrative logic rather than serving as mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent with the Textural lens, escalating effectively through the discovery of the "congregation" note during the spring tide. While the stakes are quiet, the choice to sign—affirming her erased status—carries a felt conceptual cost of permanent separation from the "official" world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The exploration of bureaucratic erasure versus lived memory is resonant and woven into the action. The written manifesto discovered on the wall ("We who don't exist must testify") borders on a Thematic Echo, stating the subtext explicitly, but it functions plausibly as a diegetic rallying cry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct, melancholic texture that matches Mari's perception. POV control is strict, effectively filtering the world through her obsession with "erasure" and "texture" without leakage, creating a consistent psychological distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density and strong rhythm throughout; the prose avoids major artifacts or loops. The "metal voices harmonizing" in the penultimate paragraph leans slightly into purple prose, but overall line-level craft is precise and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the shipping container setting with the "bureaucratic ghost" premise is fresh and specific. The execution feels organic, avoiding generic "lost soul" tropes by grounding them in the physical specificity of the harbor and the tactile nature of the marginalia.</comment>
