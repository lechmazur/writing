<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s internal conflict is rendered with high specificity, and her solution (the micro-codicil) perfectly synthesizes her professional skills with her moral need. The "haunted euphoria" moment relies slightly on diagnostic labeling, but her agency and the embodiment of her "gentle thoroughness" are excellent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the handover scene to anchor the heavy backstory of the fire and the three-day wait. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the document's meaning is fundamentally altered by the protagonist's action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting mirrors the locket photo effectively, creating a tight temporal loop that serves the theme. While the atmosphere is vivid, some descriptions ("purple waterfalls," "sheets of gold") lean toward stock imagery, slightly reducing the distinctness of the sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The resolution of the central dilemma is outstanding; Mara's choice to hide the truth within the lie employs her specific agency to satisfy both the external pressure (Eleanor) and the internal stake (historical integrity). The cost—burdening the document and herself with the secret—is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The thematic core of truth versus mercy is strong, and the codicil is a brilliant symbol. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("covenants regenerate not through forgetting..."), which acts as a thematic echo and diminishes the resonance of the image itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the archival subject matter. The transition from technical details of ink and paper to the emotional weight of the moment is handled smoothly, though the "euphoria" beat feels slightly told.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and has good momentum, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and cliché ("purple waterfalls," "sheets of gold," "halo"). The technical descriptions of the archival work are the strongest line-level elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ingenuity of the "truth codicil"—using the tools of preservation to record destruction in the margins of a restored document—is a fresh, specific, and highly effective synthesis of character and plot. It elevates a standard forgiveness narrative into something unique.</comment>
