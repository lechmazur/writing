<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kira is competent and consistently motivated, but she functions more as an executor of a plan than a character under pressure. She faces no difficult on-page choice or dilemma that tests her resolve; the "obsession" mentioned in backstory is validated immediately, leaving her arc static. The internal conflict ("wildness" vs. control) adds texture but never threatens the outcome.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear execution of a pre-established plan that proceeds without complication or snag. While the orientation and causal logic of the magic system are excellent, the lack of unforeseen variables or friction creates a flat structural arc. Closure is a distinct Decisive Change, but the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the specific geology of basalt and ice acts as a hard constraint on the ritual’s timing and method. Sensory details are vivid ("glazed with ice," "meteorite iron") and strictly filtered through the protagonist's technical expertise. The environment actively drives the plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are globally high (freedom) but immediate dramatic tension is low; the Council is an abstract concept rather than a present opposing force. The protagonist faces no trade-offs or tangible risks during the ritual, resulting in a textural rather than dramatic escalation. The pressure remains atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "geological patience" is coherent and woven into the imagery, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the narrative tends to explicate the theme through interior monologue ("Kira understood what they didn't") rather than letting it emerge solely from action. The "water freezing" metaphor successfully anchors the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and maintains a consistent Third Person Limited perspective. The tone perfectly matches the "quiet revolution" concept, blending technical observation with lyricism. Elision is handled well, keeping the focus on the immediate ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("rose like organ pipes"). There is a slight tendency toward simile stacks ("Like water... like ice...") and standard phrasing ("tide turning," "falling at first") that softens the impact. Rhythm is generally well-controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology and magnetic sci-fi creates a fresh, specific magic system. While the "quiet revolution" trope is familiar, the execution through horizon mapping offers a distinct angle. The lack of risk-taking in the plot structure holds it back from higher bands.</comment>
