<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s character arc is compelling; she reframes a terminal diagnosis from a tragedy into a functional tool for her work. The internalization of the "appointment" rather than "death sentence" demonstrates deep agency and stoicism. Her motivation is seamlessly welded to the plot's exigencies, making her sacrifice feel inevitable rather than melodramatic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, moving efficiently from the inciting diagnosis to the dawn revelation. The causal link between the predecessor's condition and the architectural requirements turns a potential coincidence into a systemic world-rule (Conceptual Repricing). Closure lands with a powerful Charged Poise, reframing the looming conflict with the trustees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary antagonist and tool; the "living stone pillars" and "architectural frequencies" constrain choices and dictate the solution. The specific interaction between the copper wire and the geology grounds the metaphysical stakes in tactile labor. The environment is fully active, not just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a property dispute (resort renovation) to an ontological breakthrough (interspecies translation). The cost is absolute—her life—but the narrative reconfigures this cost as a necessary key, deepening the conflict from survival to purpose. The pressure remains coherent and high throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "dying into translation" is original and resonant, elevating the "saving the forest" trope. While the required phrase "interspecies respect" appears explicitly in the finale, it is earned by the prior action and the dark cost of the protagonist's survival strategy. The ending offers a profound answer to the central question of value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical control that matches the "brazen calm" tone required. The psychic distance is well-managed, allowing technical details about frequencies to blend naturally with the emotional weight of the diagnosis. The narrative authority is strong and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and rhythmic, with standout phrasing like "diagnosis had arrived like salt spray" and "remodel not buildings but boundaries." Syntactic control supports the pacing, particularly in the transition from mechanical work to metaphysical realization. No significant artifacts or drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes terminal illness narratives with eco-fantasy in a fresh way. The concept that the temple is a machine requiring a dying operator to function is a specific, non-obvious invention that transforms standard tropes. The execution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
