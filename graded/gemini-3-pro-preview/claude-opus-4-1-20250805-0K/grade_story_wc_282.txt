<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Kira functions primarily as a sensory vehicle for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses or flaws. Her acceptance of the new role is immediate, lacking the internal friction or reluctance that would earn the emotional shift and deepen the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the early reliance on expository backstory slows momentum. The ending lands cleanly with the crumbling fossil, but the lack of causal obstacles makes the journey feel more like a tour than a plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the synesthetic translation of temperature into emotion ("taste temperature variations"). The environment is active, constraining the protagonist's movement and perception in ways that drive the narrative logic and grounding the sci-fi premises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, floating from one discovery to the next. The climax involves a realization rather than a high-stakes decision or trade-off, resulting in low narrative pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of transitional evolution is coherent but heavily articulated through exposition, particularly in the final paragraph. The story relies on explaining its meaning ("she understood that she was documenting...") rather than letting the subtext resonate implicitly through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "factually mystical" tone effectively. However, the psychic distance occasionally drifts into explanatory lecture to establish world rules, which slightly dampens immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery, though some "tell" heavy sentences drag on momentum. The use of "residue," "constellations," and "topology" builds a cohesive lexical set, but expository density in the first half slows the reading speed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of emotional memory with thermal physics offers a fresh, specific take on post-apocalyptic exploration tropes. The concept of "factually mystical" science feels distinct and well-realized within the short frame.</comment>
