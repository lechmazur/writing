<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya’s internal landscape relies heavily on the "somatic markers" label rather than dramatized struggle. David’s transition from "insane" to "participatory wonder" is frictionless, lacking the resistance or status shifts that characterize genuine conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear demonstration structure ("show and tell") rather than a causal arc with complications. Closure is a pure victory state where the protagonist is validated without paying any visible or felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The visual atmosphere of the light painting studio is vivid and specific, grounding the abstract concepts in concrete imagery. The muscovite geode and light effects create a strong sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain low because David is defined as an "affectionate skeptic," removing the threat of rejection or institutional consequence. His immediate conversion removes the pressure before it can escalate into a meaningful trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly lectured in dialogue ("It's not telepathy... It's empathy made tangible"), leaving no room for subtext. The characters articulate the story’s thesis to one another, which flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, but dialogue often functions as exposition for the magic system rather than natural speech. The recurring "willowglass hope" phrasing feels slightly precious and "told" rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally polished, but the phrase "somatic markers" repeats three times as a jargon crutch. The prompt phrase "fractally precise" appears twice as a static modifier, creating a repetitive cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology and light painting is inventive, but the underlying "static shock gave me powers" beat is a standard trope. The story executes a familiar "reveal" scene without subverting expectations.</comment>
