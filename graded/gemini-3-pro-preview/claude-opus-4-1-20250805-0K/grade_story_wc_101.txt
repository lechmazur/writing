<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marta functions more as an archetype of wisdom than a conflicted individual; she lacks the internal contradiction or blind spots required for deep characterization. Her motivation is noble and clear, but her certainty ("Marta understood human nature") removes the possibility of genuine psychological struggle or error on the page. She acts as a perfect vehicle for the theme rather than a flawed human under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("On the fourth week," "Six months in") rather than scenic dramatization, diluting the tension of the sanctions. While the closure lands a successful Resonant Reconfiguration of the bell's meaning, the middle section tells the story of survival rather than showing the pivotal moments of pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting is anchored well by the terra-cotta arbor and the bell, providing a consistent physical stage for the ritual. The atmosphere of "amplified quiet" is established effectively, though some descriptions ("weathered columns," "dark paths") lean toward the generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of survival is clear, but the conflict is resolved largely through summary narration of the community's success rather than through on-page obstacles. The arrival of the officials provides a climax, but the lack of an active struggle in that moment (the officials are simply met with silence) lowers the dramatic voltage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through dialogue and narration ("receiving without giving creates shame," "marketplace of dignity"). The story articulates its moral explicitly rather than allowing it to emerge organically from subtext or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the material. However, the shift into omniscient summary ("bureaucrats in distant capitals") distances the reader from Marta's immediate grounded experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent and rhythmic but relies on "literary" clichés and abstract metaphors ("forgotten prayer," "benevolent shadows," "forged in darkness"). While the "amplified quiet" is well-placed, phrases like "silent marketplace of dignity" feel overwritten and slightly imprecise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows a familiar "inspirational parable" template, using standard tropes of a wise elder and clueless officials. While executed competently, it lacks a fresh conceptual angle or specific, gritty detail to differentiate it from standard displacement narratives.</comment>
