<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus is a compelling, distinct protagonist with a clear mythic burden. His motivation to reclaim the truth is well-established, though his internal struggle is somewhat muted by the brevity of the piece; the transition from passive prisoner to active witness feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (testimony embedded in the lattice) is resonant. However, the logic of the door being "ajar for thirty years" conflicts slightly with the "desperate fingernails" detail, creating confusion about the physical constraints of his imprisonment prior to this moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "copper light" and "green brass" creating a strong sensory palette. The lighthouse prison serves as an excellent constraint that shapes the narrative tone and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The approaching supply boat provides effective ticking-clock pressure. While the stakes are high (truth vs. erasure), the external conflict is minimal as Marcus faces no active opposition in the corridor, relying heavily on the internal/thematic struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of truth living in the "spaces between heartbeats" lands well, and the reconfiguration of the "boy who cried wolf" myth is handled with sophistication. The "True-Tongue" naming convention is a bit heavy-handed but fits the fable genre.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending a fable-like cadence with sensory immediacy. The POV stays firmly with Marcus, effectively filtering the world through his unique perspective and legacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("salt air had turned green"). However, the climax relies on summary ("Images flooded through") rather than dramatized scene work, and compound neologisms like "hover-carved" feel slightly clunky.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a sequel to Aesop's fable set in a magical realism prison is highly original. The concept of the confession booth lattice retaining truths as a labyrinth is a genuinely ingenious touch.</comment>
