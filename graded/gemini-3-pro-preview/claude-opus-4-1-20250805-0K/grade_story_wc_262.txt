<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is rich and guides the narrative, with a clear micro-choice (stealing the film vs. reporting it) grounded in her character. However, her emotional reactions occasionally lean into performative sentimentality ("hushed thunder of her own heartbeat") rather than distinct personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, building density through the specific letters until the decision to intervene. Closure is distinct and active—a resonant reconfiguration where the "trash" is revalued as sacred, with the implied cost of falsifying a professional report.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specifically rendered ("cool brass," "velvet seats like closed mouths"), acting as a container for the story's memory. The constraint of the demolition effectively pressures the timeline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are internal but clear: the preservation of human emotion against oblivion. The escalation works through the intensifying intimacy of the letters, culminating in a professional transgression that feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken love is resonant, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("Some things were too sacred..."). This sermonizing summary undercuts the power of the final action by explaining the subtext rather than letting it linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter, maintaining a steady POV. It occasionally drifts into "workshop lyricism" where the prose style draws too much attention to itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm and flow are competent, but the prose suffers from abstract-concrete pairings ("dust motes and memory") and oxymoronic overwriting ("hushed thunder"). These artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of psychometric archeology in a dying theater is evocative, if slightly familiar. The specific mechanism of love stored in the splice marks and leader tape adds a fresh, tactile layer to the concept.</comment>
