<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thorne is a capable, consistent protagonist, but the lack of internal conflict or hesitation renders him somewhat static. Amara's arrival dissipates tension rather than complicating it, as her allegiance is established immediately without on-page negotiation. The shared risk is stated ("You risk much") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing a Causal/Situational Hybrid lens where the blackout enables the signal. Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise, with the revolution primed. However, the inciting incident and climax lack resistance; the obstacles are theoretical (fear of the Chancellor) rather than present in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>There is a distracting inconsistency in lighting logic. The opening describes the object reflecting "luminous fort... walls like captured fire" in "twilight," yet the premise relies on a "blackout" and "moonless dark" where the sundial casts "no shadow." This creates spatial disorientation regarding visibility and the passage of time within the single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (starting the revolution) is clear, but the scene lacks immediate pressure. The appearance of the Captain briefly raises stakes, but her immediate camaraderie deflates the potential conflict. The "cost" is abstract ("death by a thousand paper cuts") rather than a price paid by the characters on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of non-violent resistance is coherent but delivered through on-the-nose exposition ("not with swords... but with whispers"). Reliance on cliché phrases like "death by a thousand paper cuts" and "unstoppable as dawn" weakens the resonance, making the subtext surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent professional distance appropriate for a sentinel. The shift into expository details about the sundial angles ("Thirty degrees meant...") feels slightly mechanical, disrupting the narrative flow, but the overall POV discipline is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good information density, but marred by the logic break in the lighting description and the use of worn idioms ("death by a thousand paper cuts"). The flow is solid, but the imagery in the opening clashes with the established environmental constraints of the blackout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of the revolution—a quill holder placed on a half-painted sundial to reflect dawn light—is inventive and fresh. While the surrounding "guard aiding the rebellion" setup is familiar, the "cradle of sparks" concept elevates the execution above standard tropes.</comment>
