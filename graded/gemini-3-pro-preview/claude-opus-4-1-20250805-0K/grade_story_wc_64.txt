<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority effectively links her past (quilts) to her present stewardship, creating a consistent character logic. However, her competence is so high that the central discovery faces no internal resistance or doubt, reducing the emotional stakes of the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc to a resonant closure (stopping the clock, burying the relic). The causal link in the climax—translating thread colors directly into specific biographies—relies on fable logic that feels slightly rushed and unearned within the short word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and "midnight roses" establish a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the fable-like tone. The physical constraint of the silo and the lighting conditions (starlight, magnifying lamp) effectively shape the scene's intimacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story lacks significant tension or opposition; Marta untangles the mystery with ease, facing no obstacles in the decoding process. While the internal deepening is present, the absence of friction or cost until the final decision to bury the item limits narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly summarized in the text ("The shape of intentions... was circular," "Every grave... had been teaching her the same lesson") rather than emerging from subtext. This didactic explanation flattens the resonance of the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "velveteen" atmosphere. The transition from observation to epiphany is smooth, though the repetition of prompt phrases ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") draws attention to the artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("shears catching starlight," "pearl to charcoal"). Some phrasing leans toward the ornamental ("hollow throat," "endless song"), and the direct repetition of distinctive phrases reduces the freshness of the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of gardening and tapestry decoding is a creative variation on the "grief as tending" trope. While the core concept is lovely, the execution plays it safe, relying on familiar sentimental beats rather than risky or unexpected insights.</comment>
