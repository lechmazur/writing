<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling protagonist with a complex internal conflict between freedom and duty. Her motivation for staying—anchored by the seed's potential rather than just the curse—adds depth to her sacrifice. The paradoxical logic of her freedom binding her more tightly than the curse is a sophisticated character beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed around the inciting incident of the travelers' arrival and the looming frost. The "lie" about the shelter turning out to be a prepared truth effectively subverts the expected tragedy. Closure is resonant, utilizing Earned Stasis where the protagonist chooses to remain for a greater purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral and vivid; the inverted orchard serves as a unique physical constraint and a thematic mirror to the seed's future growth. The specific mechanics of the labyrinth and light impressions ground the fantasy elements. The final image of the seed growing "upward" is powerfully charged by the established setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high: the lives of the travelers and the stability of the entire valley. The tension escalates naturally with the approaching frost. The resolution relies on a meaningful choice by Mara that carries the felt cost of her own continued entrapment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of stewardship and sacrifice is woven seamlessly into the narrative without moralizing. The contrast between the twisted, inverted trees and the hope of the normal seed creates a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, balancing a tone of weary practicality with underlying melancholy. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering details through Mara's expertise. The "offhandedly exact" nature of her observations colors the prose effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("copper wings," "amber light"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the rescue. The phrasing "graceless beauty" is deployed well to characterize the aesthetic of survival.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of an inverted orchard as a structural anchor is fresh and imaginative. Combining this with the mechanic of light traces from shadows creates a unique magic system that feels specific to this world rather than generic fantasy.</comment>
