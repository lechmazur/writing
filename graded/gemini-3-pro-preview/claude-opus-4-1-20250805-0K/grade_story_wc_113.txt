<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is consistent and the physical commitment at the climax (wading into the water) effectively dramatizes his obsession. However, early interiority relies on convenience and telling ("understood them instinctively," "felt lately inspired") rather than embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to a decisive supernatural interaction. Closure lands firmly with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the restored, co-signed program), though the "next morning" jump slightly diffuses the immediate tension of the blackout climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "shallow lake" in the orchestra pit acts as both atmosphere and physical constraint. The water's depth directly influences the escalation of the final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, escalating appropriately as Marcus risks physical safety to complete the melody. The conflict is largely internal/supernatural; the external pressure (director) is mentioned but not active in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "in-between spaces" is well-integrated into the setting and the resolution. The final image of the dual-dated program successfully anchors the concept of collaboration across time without being overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atmospheric voice suits the operatic subject matter. The POV is generally stable, though occasional filter verbs ("Marcus saw," "Marcus understood") create unnecessary psychic distance in high-sensory moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("violin case floating... like a patient dog") is undercut by adverbial shortcuts ("miraculously," "perfectly") and filter verbs. The prose sustains the mood but lacks the tightness required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of water "developing" the musical notation like a photograph is a fresh, specific innovation on the ghost-musician trope. The execution elevates a familiar premise.</comment>
