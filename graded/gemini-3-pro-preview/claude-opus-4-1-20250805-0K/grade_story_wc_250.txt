<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira functions as a magical plot device rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle. Thomas remains passive throughout, receiving an unearned epiphany without making a difficult choice or paying a visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The central mechanism—reflecting starlight via a dental mirror to cast constellations on a dock—is physically implausible and breaks causal immersion. The resolution relies on a "lesson" structure where the protagonist is taught the answer, resulting in a tidy ending devoid of cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the "cobalt dock" establishes an initial mood, the spatial choreography of the light show is baffling; the geometry of reflecting house shutters behind the characters onto the ground via a tiny dental mirror is illegible. The setting acts as a stage for a metaphor rather than a grounded physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story lacks genuine pressure; the conflict is internal but resolved entirely by an external agent's demonstration. Thomas faces no dilemma, creates no tactical shift, and pays no toll for his healing, resulting in a flat narrative arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative explicitly explains its own symbols ("demonstrated with the shutters how grief was like closing every window"), stripping the theme of subtext. The emotional logic is delivered as a sermon, leaving no room for reader interpretation or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The point of view drifts from Mira’s external observation to Thomas’s internal realization without clear transition (head-hopping). The narrative voice is overly interpretive, frequently telling the reader what the characters understand rather than showing it through action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose relies on awkward adverbial phrasing ("spiralingly calm") and clichés ("lodged in his throat like a stone"). The heavy use of filter verbs ("Thomas began to understand," "Thomas found himself") distances the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Using a dental mirror as a tool for starlight is a novel, if implausible, image that adds a spark of ingenuity. However, the overarching structure of a silent guardian teaching a life lesson to a grieving stranger is a conventional trope.</comment>
