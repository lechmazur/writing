<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is deep and embodied, particularly the "practiced intention" of freezing, which flips a typical trauma response into agency. The diagnostic language ("somatic markers," "nervous system") risks clinical distancing but is successfully grounded in the character's history with Dr. Mansour.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the beacon sweeping "the living and the dead" crystallizes the dual reality of violence and growth. The "Earned Stasis" is felt as a tangible cost through the dirt under her fingernails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the ancient cedar functions as an essential tool for the protagonist's grounding technique. The landscape reflects the narrative arc, merging the history of war with the persistence of nature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining composure and purpose against intrusive trauma—is tightened effectively by the "tremor" beat. The escalation is internal and quiet, fitting the Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The thematic linkage of "white orchids, then white phosphorus, then white sheets" is exceptional, grounding the abstraction of grief in visceral specifics. The ending achieves resonance without moralizing, validating the indifference of nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, lyrical distance that mirrors the protagonist's dissociation and control. The POV shift to the lighthouse's automated perspective at the end effectively widens the scope to support the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense ("drones that moved like wasps"), with strong sensory signaling. A momentary lapse into abstract summary ("anchored optimism in realism") slightly flattens the mid-story momentum, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parallel between automated warfare (drones) and automated safety (lighthouse) creates a fresh, specific framework for the gardening-as-healing trope. The specific "signature strike" context elevates the premise beyond generic tragedy.</comment>
