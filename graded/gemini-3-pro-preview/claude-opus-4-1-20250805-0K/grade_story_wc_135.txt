<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kessa is a distinct, consistent presence with a clear motivation. However, she functions more as a vehicle for the story's philosophical thesis than as a living character in a pressure cooker; her internal landscape is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult, on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative spans a full year, relying on montage and summary ("The archive grew...") rather than a continuous scene with immediate pressure. This scope violation dilutes the tension, as the "struggle" to archive is told as a successful process rather than shown as a precarious attempt in a specific moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor is rendered with evocative, sensory specificity ("salt crystals clung," "rain-washed windows"). The atmosphere of post-exile melancholy is palpable and supports the thematic weight of the story effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptual rather than urgent; there is minimal opposition or risk of failure. The community's acceptance and the archive's success happen smoothly over time, lacking a sharp beat where Kessa's goal is genuinely threatened or tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but delivered didactically. Kessa explicitly articulates the thesis in dialogue ("The exile taught us that absence has its own grammar"), which flattens the subtext into text and explains the meaning rather than letting it emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, handling the "ocean-spray" metaphor with control. The tone remains elevated and cohesive, fitting the "archivist" persona well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rich, though occasionally dense with figurative language ("salt crystals... like memories"). The transitions between time periods are handled smoothly, though they rely on scaffolding that distances the reader from the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of an archive of "absences" and the "mechanical sigh" of the valve are inventive and memorable. The execution follows a somewhat traditional "rebuilding the community" arc, but the specific artifacts (trumpet valve, intervals) add freshness.</comment>
