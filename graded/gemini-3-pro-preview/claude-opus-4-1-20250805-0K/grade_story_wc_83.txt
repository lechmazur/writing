<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Amira is a competent, proactive protagonist whose agency drives the plot from the planned intrusion to the final release. Her motivation is deeply rooted in backstory, though her emotional experience is occasionally summarized ("grief," "hope") rather than fully embodied in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, utilizing the "cooling time" countdown to create effective structural pressure. Closure is achieved through a decisive change with visible cost (arrest) and a clear alteration of the world state, satisfying the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting is functional and well-integrated, specifically the elevation detail justifying the "thinner boundary." However, the sensory experience of "floating" is told more than felt; the environment feels largely like a standard lab until the window view at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate naturally with the alarm and security arrival. The final choice creates a meaningful trade-off—sacrificing Amira's safety and the data's scientific value to restore the "potential" to the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming unlived lives is poignant but handled heavily; dialogue and narration explicitly state the moral ("We return it," "remembered how to hope"). Subtext is surrendered for direct thematic assertion in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and controls the pacing well, though it occasionally slips into melodramatic abstraction ("glow... with possibility itself"). The scientific authority feels plausible enough to support the speculative premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and maintains momentum, with good sentence variety. There is a tendency toward purple phrasing ("bleak exhilaration," "intangibly tangible") that detracts slightly from the grit of the subject matter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of geodes recording "trauma signatures" as unused potential is a fresh synthesis of ghost story and quantum sci-fi tropes. The execution is solid, though the "release the energy to heal the world" ending is a familiar genre beat.</comment>
