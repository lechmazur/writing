<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is a compelling hook that organically drives her unique investigative method. Motivation is clear, but the climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("identity disorders") rather than dramatized behavioral insight, which renders the resolution slightly clinical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, but the causal chain breaks at the deduction; the leap from the number of portraits to the specific timeframe ("seventeen months ago") lacks on-page evidence. Closure serves as a solution to the puzzle but lacks a visceral personal cost beyond physical fatigue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details—limestone, charcoal dust, mist—effectively ground the abstract mental work in a tangible reality. The quarry setting mirrors the thematic focus on fragmentation and excavation without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily intellectual (solving the riddle) rather than immediate or dangerous. While the accumulative pressure of the drawings works well, the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma in the scene, keeping tension low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of duality is integral to the mystery's solution, but the ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("proofs that we are all divided selves"), flattening the resonance into a thesis statement rather than leaving it as subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and confident, filtering the world effectively through the artist's tactile perception. Narrative distance is well-managed, maintaining the detective's internal focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("sibilance of charcoal"), though figurative language is dense and occasionally leans into "writerly" phrasing ("silk weave speak of expensive parties").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of face blindness, forensic art, and a quarry setting creates a distinct and original atmosphere. While the "savant profiler" resolution is a familiar trope, the specific execution remains fresh.</comment>
