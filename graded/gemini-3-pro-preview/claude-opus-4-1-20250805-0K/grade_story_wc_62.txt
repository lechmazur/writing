<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Martha’s motivation to honor the collective grief is well-dramatized through her labor, and her interiority feels grounded in the craft. The grandfather functions more as a convenient dispensary of wisdom than a fully realized character, bordering on the "magical mentor" trope. His dialogue is often didactic, which flattens the emotional complexity of their relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, braiding the carving progress with the migration season effectively. However, the discovery of the poem at the end relies on shaky causality: it is unclear why Martha would unroll the entire ribbon (a 30-year-old heirloom) specifically on this night after merely using it as a visual reference for weeks. This unearned reveal weakens the closure’s logical footing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "iron bones black against the salmon sky" and the clustering monarchs grounding the scene beautifully. The sensory details of the stone carving—grain, dust, temperature—are integrated well with the action, enhancing the "fiercely meditative" mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the deadline of the migration adds a tangible pressure to the abstract task of mourning. The cost is depicted through endurance and physical strain ("pressing too hard"), fitting the accumulative drive. The climax is quieter—a ceremony of witness—which works for the scope, though the conflict remains largely internal and low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of collective grief is resonant but handled with a heavy hand. Characters explicitly articulate the story's thesis in dialogue ("Grief was like butterfly migration..."), which converts subtext into text and reduces the reader's interpretative work. This "Thematic Echo" limits the emotional power of the otherwise strong final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reverent tone that suits the subject matter. The shift between Martha’s solitary work and the collective gathering is handled smoothly. Dialogue is serviceable but occasionally stiff, particularly the grandfather’s instructional lines, which feel staged rather than natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. However, the specific phrase "thundering calm" appears twice (once in memory, once in Martha's speech), creating a repetitive artifact that draws attention to itself. Some descriptors like "fiercely meditative" feel slightly adjectival and told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of stone carving, pandemic grief, and butterfly migration is a fresh and poignant angle. However, the "ghostly mentor" and the "hidden note found at the perfect moment" are familiar sentimental tropes that lower the ingenuity score. The execution elevates these elements, but the underlying structure is conventional.</comment>
