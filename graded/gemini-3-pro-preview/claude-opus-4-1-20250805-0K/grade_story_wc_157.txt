<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clearly dramatized through the final sacrifice, earning the emotional beat with visible cost. However, Serena relies on archetypal shorthand ("charming rogue," "practiced nonchalance") and her dialogue feels slightly performative rather than grounded in the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Excellent economy; the single scene effectively creates a "handoff" structure where the inciting arrival leads directly to a sacrificial closure (Decisive Change). The causality holds firmly under a situational lens, with the insect defense mechanism providing a satisfying, logic-consistent resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is a tactile, well-rendered micro-setting that directly enables the protagonist's tactics (using insects as jammers). The sensory details ("humid gleam," "ten thousand wings") effectively contrast the sterile threat of the Auditors outside.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent and rapid; the transition from the quiet intrusion to the physical pounding of the Auditors forces a clear, high-cost choice. Marcus's decision to stay creates a legible trade-off between personal safety and the survival of the movement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "resistance is ecosystem" motif is well-integrated into the action, but the dialogue creates a "Thematic Echo" issue by explicitly stating the thesis ("Consciousness is not commodity"). The final line successfully re-encodes the theme into a resonant image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, keeping close to Marcus's perception. However, there are minor lapses into explanatory telling ("speaking truth through deliberate obscurity") that filter the experience rather than trusting the reader to infer the dynamic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm and acoustic texture ("hummed," "cacophonous"), fitting the insect motif. A few abstract phrases ("practiced nonchalance," "deliberate obscurity") act as mild scaffold artifacts, slowing the otherwise high density of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blend of botanical/entomological science with linguistic rebellion offers a genuinely fresh iteration of the dystopia genre. While the "thought police" frame is familiar, the specific mechanism of resistance—insects and vegetables as encryption—feels inventive and specific.</comment>
