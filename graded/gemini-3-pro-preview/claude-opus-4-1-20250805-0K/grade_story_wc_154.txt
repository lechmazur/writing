<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to translate is clear, but her interiority relies on labeled abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than embodied sensation. The "shrewdly innocent" child is a stock characterization that feels convenient rather than individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing and the physical cost of giving up the coral. However, the sudden arrival of the "diverse cast" (veteran, nurse) in the final beat feels contrived and dilutes the earned intimacy of the dyad.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium provides a distinct, claustrophobic atmosphere that mirrors the morphine haze. Specificity is generally good, though "mist-clad" leans into archaic description rather than sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding purpose—is addressed, but the scene lacks escalating pressure; the interaction is cooperative from the start. The "cost" of the phantom pain is mentioned but doesn't significantly hinder the action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story succumbs to explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Maya understood then... teaching that communication transcends language"), summarizing the theme rather than letting the image resonate alone. This sermonizing undercuts the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the morphine-haze setup. However, it occasionally slips into filter-heavy explanation ("understanding suddenly that...") instead of trusting the reader to interpret the child's drawings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose flows well but suffers from overwriting ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent," "mist-clad") that distances the reader. The final summary creates a drag on momentum right at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "wounded healer taught by a child" trope is played straight without significant subversion. While the coral-as-brain image is nice, the execution follows a familiar, sentimental path.</comment>
