<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira functions as an archetype rather than a character, lacking internal conflict, flaws, or doubt. Her primary challenge is resolved via backstory ("answer had come to her in dreams") rather than active ingenuity in the moment, leaving her with no difficult choices on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story follows a linear procedural structure without reversals, unexpected obstacles, or cost. The planting is a foregone conclusion, and the closure—a simple success without sacrifice—lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" to earn the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The liminal setting is visualized with competent sensory detail ("mist became her thread," "honey"), though it leans on familiar high-fantasy tropes like nameless colors. The environment supports the ritual but provides no resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Narrative drive is weak due to a lack of active opposition or immediate risk; the process proceeds smoothly from start to finish. The stakes ("magic itself") are high in the abstract but generate no concrete pressure or urgency in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit authorial explanation ("She was not just planting a seed; she was mending a wound") rather than subtext or action. This over-articulation flattens the potential for emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone suitable for a fable. However, the gravitas occasionally feels unearned, treating the procedural planting with the weight of an epic without the accompanying struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjective-heavy "purple" description and tell-y shortcuts. The phrase "insatiably creative" appears twice as a clumsy label rather than a demonstrated trait, disrupting the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The central image of using pruning shears to stitch reality is an inventive metaphor. However, the surrounding plot—saving dying magic with a last heirloom seed—is a standard genre template executed without a fresh twist.</comment>
