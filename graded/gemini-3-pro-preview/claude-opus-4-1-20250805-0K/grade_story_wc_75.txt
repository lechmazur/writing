<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marta is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation. However, the emotional climax—the shift from dread to "fierce tenderness"—is summarized in the final paragraph rather than dramatized through a distinct interaction, reading more as an authorial conclusion than a character's lived shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, driven by the situational pressure of the thaw. The closure (documenting the end) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the loss of the physical history), satisfying the rubric's requirement for a decisive ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset. The specificity of the bread initials and the olfactory cue of rosewater preceding destruction creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere that constrains the character's options effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Situational pressure is coherent and escalates well through the sensory details of the thaw (crashing ice, weeping walls). The ticking clock ("hours, maybe less") effectively tightens the narrative focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the narrative voice ("resistance against erasure," "transforming loss into legacy"). This tells the reader how to feel instead of letting the resonant image of the melting bread-prints do the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, but relies on filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she thought") which creates unnecessary psychic distance. The tone matches the gothic/melancholy content well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is competent and descriptive but relies on some "scaffold" phrasing ("Working frantically," "familiar dread"). The use of "palimpsest" feels slightly cliché in this context, but the overall rhythm supports the mood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a city carved behind a waterfall is imaginative, and the specific detail of the bread initials lifts the "archivist" trope into something fresher and more specific.</comment>
