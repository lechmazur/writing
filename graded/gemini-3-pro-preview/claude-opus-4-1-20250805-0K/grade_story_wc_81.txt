<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is tightly bound to the setting and constraints; Mira's internal drive ("find profound purpose in the quiet spaces") perfectly justifies her risk-taking. The choice to stay until the last safe moment demonstrates a hierarchy of values where truth outweighs safety, creating a strong, earned emotional core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Structure is exemplary; the ticking clock of the pressure/power restoration creates natural urgency that tightens the focus. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the algae from mere light source to "patient guardians," effectively recontextualizing the environment with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not just backdrop but an active participant; the acoustics of the "singing" books and the specific wavelength of the algae light act as essential tools that constrain and enable the protagonist's actions. The interplay between the "reclaimed stillness" and the protagonist's task is seamless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and escalate well via the "ticking clock" of the returning power and dropping pressure. The shift from checking volumes to identifying page-specific forgeries provides a solid deepening of the conflict, though the specific nature of the reveal (corporate water rights) leans slightly into standard tropes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of analog truth surviving in the margins of a digital/corporate world is resonant and well-executed. The final image of the "green-glowing ink" waiting for the next blackout lands the thematic argument beautifully without being overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a "tranquilly perceptive" distance that suits the librarian archetype while conveying urgency. The perspective remains tightly anchored to Mira’s sensory experience, particularly the tactile and auditory details of her work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, with strong rhythm. However, the integration of prompt-specific phrases like "tranquilly perceptive purpose" results in a clunky adjective-stack artifact that briefly disrupts the otherwise smooth flow. The phrase "act of dappled resolve" also feels slightly forced semantically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic forensic indexing in a submerged library is imaginative and distinct. While the "drowned city" trope is familiar, the specific mechanic of using the blackout's silence to verify truth adds a fresh, sensory layer to the genre.</comment>
