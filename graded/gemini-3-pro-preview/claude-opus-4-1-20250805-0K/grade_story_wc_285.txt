<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a static functionary with no internal conflict; the passenger is a passive recipient of magical aid who lacks agency. The relationship is transactional rather than dramatic, missing the "crucible" of pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative acts as a linear vignette without causal complications; the resolution functions as a "soft reset" of the woman's trauma, dissolving her burden without a dramatized cost or difficult choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fog functioning as a physical archive of promises is a compelling, highly specific setting element that integrally shapes the magical logic and the protagonist's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative pressure is absent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or trade-offs, merely performing a routine service that succeeds exactly as intended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The central theme is delivered via expository dialogue ("promises aren't meant to accumulate"), reducing subtextual power and rendering the story's meaning instructional rather than experiential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The fable-like voice is consistent and atmospheric, though the POV creates distance and briefly head-hops to the woman's visual perspective ("she could almost see it").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose rhythm and imagery are polished, though emotional beats rely on abstract labeling ("betrayal," "disappointment") rather than concrete embodiment or action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central concept of "knitting promises from fog" is fresh and evocative, providing a distinct angle on the otherwise familiar "mysterious healer" framework.</comment>
