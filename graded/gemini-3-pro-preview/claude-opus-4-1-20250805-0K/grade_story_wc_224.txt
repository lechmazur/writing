<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—escaping the pain of prophecy—is well-established, and the sensory details of her blindness ground her experience. However, the internal arc relies on a sudden, stone-induced epiphany ("She understood then") rather than a decision forced by escalating pressure. The choice to plant is meaningful, but the transition from seer to gardener feels more like a therapeutic realization than a high-stakes dramatic turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, but the climax relies on spatial and magical convenience: she simply follows a new path to find the perfect "chamber where no books lived" exactly when needed. The causality link between the stone's script and the "memory of seeds" is abstract and metaphorical rather than mechanically earned, making the resolution feel soft and slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and highly specific; the "spiraling book walls" and "mercury pools" create a distinct, atmospheric world that constrains the protagonist's blind navigation effectively. The sensory details—feeling leather spines, the smell of rain—anchor the fantasy elements in a tactile reality, enhancing the "silver-blind" perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The conflict between memory and prophecy is compelling, but the resolution lacks a gritty, felt cost. The protagonist trades a painful existence for a healing one; while she endures the pain of remembering to activate the stone, the ending feels like a pure upgrade (gaining a garden/home) rather than a complex trade-off typical of higher-band literary fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is central but handled with heavy-handed explicitness. The character articulates the theme aloud ("This stone speaks of buried talents") and the narration summarizes the moral lesson at the end ("understanding at last the shape of home... a talent recovered"). This lack of subtextual ambiguity flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The control over the "silver-blind" perspective is strong, though there are moments where the narrative distance collapses into explanatory telling ("She understood then what she'd been searching for") rather than remaining immersed in the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished with evocative imagery ("mercury... rippled without wind"), but suffers from explanatory scaffolding. Phrases like "Not literal ones, but the memory of seeds" and "not her past, but permission to plant" interrupt the narrative flow to decode the metaphor for the reader, reducing the density and impact of the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "library of living books" and the "gardener" backstory is a fresh, creative image. While the "reclaiming lost self" arc is a standard trope, the specific execution of plants growing words offers a memorable and distinct visual resolution.</comment>
