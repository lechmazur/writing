<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena is a coherent focalizer with a clear motivation, but her internal shift is smoothed over by summary rather than dramatized in scene. The antagonists (colleagues) are reduced to "performative" strawmen, lacking dimension or credible counter-arguments. The "career suicide" moment is reported rather than felt, distancing the reader from the emotional reality of the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on montage/summary covering weeks, which flattens the causal tension of the resignation; the decisive moment happens off-page. The resolution—demolition postponed because notes magically predict structural failure—feels convenient and unearned, removing the weight of her sacrifice too quickly. The mechanism of "dust predicting structural collapse" strains credibility within the established realistic tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse atmosphere is vivid and sensory details like the rot and mud are effective. However, the specific visualization of how butterfly dust maps "air currents" to predict beam failure is difficult to picture concretely, bordering on metaphorical rather than physical. The setting serves the theme well but the mechanics remain vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stakes (career vs. truth) are declared but the conflict is largely internal and summarized. The external threat (demolition) is introduced late and resolved instantly by the protagonist's notes, lacking a struggle or genuine testing of her resolve. The validation of her work by "scientists from multiple disciplines" arrives too easily, negating the cost of her resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is heavily didactic, with the narrative explicitly stating its lesson multiple times ("drama as the enemy," "decay is instruction"). The final entry functions as a moralizing summary that lectures the reader rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own. This explicit signaling significantly reduces the thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and fits the character's background, though it maintains a high level of psychic distance. The use of scientific metaphors is appropriate for the POV, though occasionally abstract ("preprocess reality"). The voice tells us about her understanding more often than it shows the raw perception leading to it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished but leans on abstract descriptors ("unlikely corners," "profound truths") and summarized action. There are instances of "template cadence" in the montage sections ("She began visiting," "Elena started seeing"). The phrase "fractal patterns that echoed stellar formation" feels slightly decorative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The arc of a scientist finding truth in nature over academia is a familiar trope. While the "dust map" concept is inventive, its execution feels scientifically implausible, and the "quiet epiphany" resolution follows a standard path without a surprising synthesis or risk.</comment>
