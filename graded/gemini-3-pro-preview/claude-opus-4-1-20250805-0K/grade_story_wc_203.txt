<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus is a distinct protagonist with a compelling specific competence (dust analysis). However, his climactic realization relies on an unearned intuitive leap ("Understanding flooded through him") rather than the established trait of observation, weakening his agency at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative builds a solid investigative chain until the climax, which pivots on a "knowledge leap." The protagonist divines complex backstory details (grandmother's specific sabotage methods) instantly from a warm object, bypassing the scene's causal logic and resorting to summary explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific ("dying wasp," "yellow as old teeth"), establishing a strong noir atmosphere. The dust analysis serves as an excellent micro-setting interaction that effectively constrains the search and grounds the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear but largely retrospective, centering on historical corruption rather than immediate danger. The conflict lacks active opposition or rising pressure in the present moment, resulting in a low-cost resolution where the burden is merely accepted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of structural and moral failure ("cracks in the facade") is well-integrated early on. However, the ending dissolves into explicit moralizing ("every broken thing could still be fixed") that flattens the story's complexity into a tidy lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent noir tone. The only disruption is the forced phrasing required by the prompt ("engaged with the space"), which briefly breaks the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with high density and evocative imagery. The score is limited by the "explain-everything" summary paragraph at the climax, which tells rather than shows the critical backstory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of an elevator mechanic diagnosing ghosts via mechanical failure is ingenious and fresh. The execution, however, follows a standard procedural path that relies on familiar tropes to resolve the mystery.</comment>
