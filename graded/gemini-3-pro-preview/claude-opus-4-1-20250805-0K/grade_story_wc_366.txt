<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elsa accepts a lifetime of supernatural servitude with diagnostic ease ("She could be alone without becoming lonely"). The transition from supply runner to ghost warden lacks internal friction or doubt, and her motivation relies on immediate acceptance of a convenient destiny rather than an earned decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The climax relies on a soft magic system ("intention, not oil") that resolves the problem instantly without cost or failure. The revelation that the ghosts snuffed the light to recruit her undercuts the "danger" stakes, yet this manipulation is never addressed by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and consistent ("phosphorescent foam," "breathing stairs"), though it leans on standard lighthouse tropes. The sensory details effectively establish the mood, even if the "pulsing" sea glass veers into ungrounded magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Tension evaporates immediately upon meeting the ghosts, who are sad rather than threatening. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs; the solution (thinking warm thoughts) is abstract and requires no sacrifice, rendering the "danger" stone a false alarm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly sermonized in dialogue ("loneliness is worse than death") and the final narration ("You are seen. You are not alone"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, delivering a Hallmark-style moral rather than an earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but prone to melodrama ("dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky"). Dialogue serves primarily as exposition for the plot's supernatural mechanics rather than revealing character distinctness or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from sentimental adjectival phrasing ("peculiar ache," "anguished"). The "telling" of emotions prevents visceral impact, and the pacing drags during the expository dialogue in the lantern room.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—a lonely person finding purpose as a ghost guardian—is a familiar trope. While the "stone language" offers a spark of ingenuity, the "magic fueled by positive emotion" resolution is generic.</comment>
