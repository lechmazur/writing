<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's "proprioceptive" interiority is excellent, grounding her emotional arc in specific physical sensations and data. The shift from victim to healer is driven by her specific enhancements, though the emotional pivot feels slightly rapid given the depth of the initial trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from physical sensation to conceptual realization to action. Closure lands with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, though the introduction of the child at the end feels slightly utilitarian as a target for the protagonist's new purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is effectively filtered through the protagonist's enhanced perception, making the UV forest intrinsic to the viewpoint rather than just a backdrop. The specific details like "impossible soil" and "Fibonacci spirals" ground the abstract math theme in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal escalation is effective as she reframes her trauma responses, but external stakes remain low; the environment and the child offer little resistance. The resolution feels somewhat easy compared to the setup, lacking a sharp, on-page cost for the transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is integral but articulated too explicitly in narrative summary ("This was her penance, then—not punishment but transformation") and dialogue. This over-explanation reduces the subtextual power of the "inverse equation" metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clinical, geometric voice ("twenty-three degrees," "forty-seven grams") consistently reflects the protagonist's conditioning. This stylistic choice effectively mirrors her psychological state and supports the "mathematics of mercy" concept without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic ("drowning in reverse"), maintaining high information density. However, some phrasing leans into abstraction ("decimals of her pain"), and the "cracking open... not breaking" line is a familiar cliché that softens the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of torture survival with enhanced proprioception is fresh and engaging. While the "healer in exile" trope is familiar, the specific mechanism of inverting pain data adds a unique, intelligent layer to the concept.</comment>
