<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera is a consistent, competent professional whose internal logic drives the narrative. However, the central internal conflict—the temptation to consume—is resolved primarily through a "cardinal rule" rather than visceral, high-stakes struggle on the page, making her resilience feel slightly safe and static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct closure (Earned Stasis) where Vera reaffirms her role. The "cost" of her choice—emotional isolation—is legible but largely conceptual; the ending lands smoothly but lacks a sharp, unexpected deepening of the initial premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, integrating sensory details (static, scent, taste) with physical constraints (the sealing grotto) that directly pressure the protagonist's actions. The amber grotto feels lived-in and functionally essential to the plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>External pressure (the closing window) works well, but the internal escalation feels somewhat linear. The climax, where she resists the urge to "subsume," is resolved quickly by professional discipline, missing an opportunity for a more perilous, agonizing moment of near-failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "merciful lies" and partial truths resonates strongly through the specific imagery of the amber. The ending reinforces this concept with a poignant, non-moralizing reconfiguration of what "honesty" means in the context of grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains a polished, consistent tone of "affectionate detachment" that suits the magical realism genre perfectly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, allowing access to Vera’s expertise while maintaining her professional shield.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the emotions. Minor reliance on standard adjective pairings ("ancient resin," "professionally thorough") prevents the highest band, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "emotion dealer" trope with the specific mechanics of static electricity and amber harvesting creates a fresh, memorable conceit. The metaphor of the blotter petal adds a tactile specificity that grounds the fantasy elements.</comment>
