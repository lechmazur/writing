<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mira operates as a hyper-competent archetype rather than a nuanced character; she predicts and manipulates the outcome without doubt, struggle, or internal conflict. Her success is a foregone conclusion, and her "flaws" are nonexistent, preventing any emotional engagement or character growth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear "plan-execution-success" path with no deviation or complication; the resolution relies on the magical efficacy of the maps rather than dramatized interaction. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" (see Q2 Cost proof test)—Mira simply wins and feels satisfied, rendering the victory weightless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting of the Obsidian Spire and the "ignorance maps" creates a distinct, atmospheric aesthetic that suits the fable-like tone. However, the meeting room itself is vague, and the physical environment ceases to pressure the characters once the Council arrives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the antagonist (the Council) arrives and immediately succumbs to the protagonist's influence without generating friction or forcing Mira to adapt. The conflict is theoretical rather than visceral, as the opposition offers no effective resistance to the "visual algorithms."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("This was how transformation sustained itself...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The story explains its subtext to the reader, reducing the potential for genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The POV is unstable; it establishes Mira's perspective but drifts into convenient omniscience during the meeting (accessing Vance's thoughts, the engineer's drifting eyes) while Mira watches from a tower. This head-hopping dissolves tension and breaks the narrative anchor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is competent but leans into abstraction ("visual symphonies of probability") and summary rather than concrete scene work. Phrases like "darkness cannot darken what already gleams black" feel overwrought and slightly tautological.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "ignorance cartographer" concept is a fresh and intriguing angle on the innovation trope. However, the execution—using art to subliminally reprogram bureaucrats—is a familiar "magic feather" device that lowers the ingenuity score.</comment>
