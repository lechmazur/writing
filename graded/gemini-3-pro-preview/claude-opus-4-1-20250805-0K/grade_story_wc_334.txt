<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Margaret is competent and her motivation is clear, grounded in a specific history with Gran. However, the emotional climax relies on summary ("Margaret understood now") and labeling ("familiar thrill") rather than dramatized internal struggle. The burden of the dark memories is accepted with a swift resolve that feels slightly unearned by the prior pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to a distinct resonant reconfiguration where Margaret shifts from seeker to keeper. The causal link between the broken constellations and the memory loss is a strong structural logic that pays off. Closure is solid, with the conceptual cost of carrying the "heavy" histories legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the "broken constellations" etched into the greenhouse glass are a specific, high-concept detail that constrains the protagonist's investigation. The sunken orchard atmosphere is palpable and effectively charges the final image of the shipwrecks as sentinels. The integration of the environment into the plot mechanics is seamless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal, but the escalation is primarily informational (decoding the map) rather than a rising pressure that forces difficult choices. While the thematic cost is high, the protagonist faces little active opposition or agonizing trade-offs until the final ritual. The tension is atmospheric rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus survival is handled with nuance; the revelation that Gran traded memories to survive the famine adds significant depth. The story avoids a simple "memories are good" moral by acknowledging the trauma required to survive, yet Margaret's choice to bear them anyway resonates strongly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, melancholy tone appropriate for the subject. The voice effectively filters the world through a folklorist's lens, noticing patterns and stories, though it occasionally slips into expositional summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative ("squelched," "amber shadows") but relies on some standard phrasing ("familiar thrill of discovery," "shattered glass ceiling") and filter verbs ("she could see," "Margaret understood"). The description of the constellations is the highlight, but line-level texture could be sharper in the internal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "broken constellations" on the greenhouse glass with the concept of memory harvesting is a fresh, specific conceit that elevates the "memory garden" trope. The transformation of shipwrecks into monuments of payment rather than just weather victims is a creative turn.</comment>
