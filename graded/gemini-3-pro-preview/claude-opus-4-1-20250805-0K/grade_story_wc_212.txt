<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira functions as a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; she executes a prepared ritual without facing internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choices. The lack of a "relationship as crucible" or personal flaw makes her success feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path of successful procedural execution without a decisive turn or reversal. The closure fails the cost requirement; the ending is purely additive (restoration) with no visible or felt price paid for the magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The integration of specific heirloom varieties (Cherokee Purple, Glass Gem) with the temporal magic creates a vivid, grounded texture. The atmospheric shift from frozen stasis to vibrant growth is handled well via sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Declared stakes (unraveling causality) remain abstract and are never tested on the page; the ritual proceeds smoothly without distinct obstacles or escalation. There is no point where the outcome feels in doubt, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and continuity is coherent but resolves into explicit moralizing ("true inheritance wasn't about...") rather than implicit resonance. The didactic conclusion flattens the potential complexity of "borrowed time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The elevated, mythic tone is consistent and suits the subject matter, maintaining a stable distance. However, the voice occasionally drifts into adjectival excess ("impossible tomatoes," "recursive wheat") that feels slightly performative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and polished but marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of the prompt phrase "furiously tranquil." Some redundancy exists ("sublime directly into vapor"), though information density is generally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving and temporal mechanics is a fresh conceptual angle, though the plot structure—a flawless magical ritual—is a standard trope. The imagery elevates a familiar "restoration" narrative.</comment>
