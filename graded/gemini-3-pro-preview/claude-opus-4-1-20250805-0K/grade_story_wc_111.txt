<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marta is a distinct, realized presence with a coherent worldview that drives her choices. While she functions effectively as a mentor figure, the lack of internal doubt or significant resistance from the young woman makes her role feel slightly static in the present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, moving from established routine to a distinct moment of transmission (passing the marble). The flashback to the inspector is exposition-heavy but necessary; the closure lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration of the luck concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric contrast between the sterile "Luck Index" and the organic, defiant garden is excellent. Specific details like the clicking marbles and the copper wire monument ground the magical realism in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear, but the scene lacks immediate pressure; Marta has already mastered her method, and the antagonist (the Ministry) is distant. The young woman accepts the resolution too easily, minimizing the felt cost of the transaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central metaphor—deception as a nurturing force against cold mathematics—is thematically rich and beautifully executed. The ending resonates, though the dialogue risks becoming slightly didactic in its articulation of the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and lyrical ("destiny could be weighed like flour"), fitting the fable-like tone perfectly. The POV remains tightly anchored in Marta’s perception, enhancing the "wise gardener" persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with evocative imagery ("ripening toward rot"). A minor cliché ("practiced ease") appears early, but the line-level craft is otherwise dense and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of "lying to plants" to circumvent a bureaucratic luck system is an inventive, specific synthesis of tropes. The physical manifestation of these lies as cracked marbles adds a fresh layer of ingenuity.</comment>
