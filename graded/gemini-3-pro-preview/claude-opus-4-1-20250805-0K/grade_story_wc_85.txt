<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character conception is excellent; Elias's profession as a forger of histories creates deep, organic irony when confronted with his grandfather's hidden truth. The internal conflict is vivid, and the decision to dismantle his life's work feels earned by the specific weight of the discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a mysterious inciting incident to a coherent realization and a Decisive Change with visible cost. The connection between the driftwood dates and the protagonist's prior knowledge is slightly convenient, but the closure is forceful and causally sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the driftwood carvings serving as effective micro-setting elements that constrain attention. The "cobalt terrace" is vivid, though the name feels slightly abstract; the sensory details of the carvings ground the scene well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally from curiosity to personal horror to professional renunciation. The cost—losing his wealth and career to honor the truth—is stark and legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of complicity and the cost of silence is powerful, but the ending leans too heavily on explicit moralizing ("Some weights... could only be lifted..."). This explanation dampens the resonance of the final image by summarizing the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a melancholic weight that suits the subject matter. The introspection is controlled, blending memory and present action without head-hopping or confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic. "Sieved hush" is a strong, recurring phrase, though "bruised purples" in the opening is a slight cliché. The density of information is high, moving the story forward efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a black-market genealogist facing his grandfather's mapped betrayals via driftwood is highly original. The parallel between the two generations' forms of dishonesty creates a fresh and compelling narrative frame.</comment>
