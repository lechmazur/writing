<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kessa is defined by high competence and role rather than internal conflict or dilemma. Her struggle is purely physical ("muscles aching") rather than a choice between competing values or a psychological hurdle. While functional, the lack of a difficult trade-off or flaw limits the emotional depth of her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path from problem to solution, with a defined closure unit (Decisive Change). However, the resolution relies heavily on the sudden arrival of the whales (external aid) and the "sonic engineering" magic system, which lowers the sense of earned causality. The stakes are resolved without a significant complication or setback.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is imaginatively integrated into the plot; the orchard is not just a backdrop but the instrument of salvation. Sensory details are vivid ("salt-kissed branches," "blue hour"), and the physical constraints of the driftwood raft directly shape the protagonist's actions and the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through external threats (the tightening gyre) and physical exertion, but there is no moment where Kessa must pay a significant price or make a hard choice. The "cost" is limited to fatigue, and the victory feels inevitable once the playing begins, lacking a pivot where failure seems genuinely possible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of transforming obstacles into art is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph to drive it home. The text explicitly states the lesson ("every obstacle... was simply an unplayed instrument"), which flattens the resonance and triggers the thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, successfully blending maritime, musical, and semi-scientific registers ("sonic engineering," "cloud-script") to create a fable-like tone. The narrative distance is consistent, though the shift to technical jargon ("dubbed," "frequency") occasionally clashes slightly with the mystic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong density and rhythm. However, a few phrasings feel slightly clunky ("fractal generating inward"), and "sussurus" is misspelled (susurrus). The description occasionally leans toward purple ("restless euphony"), but the imagery remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept of playing a floating orchard like a xylophone to break a current is highly original and memorable. The synthesis of music, fractals, and maritime survival creates a unique aesthetic that elevates the familiar "escape the trap" plot.</comment>
