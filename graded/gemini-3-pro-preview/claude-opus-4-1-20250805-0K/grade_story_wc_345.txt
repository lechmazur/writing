<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a cipher whose interiority is limited to "collective purpose" and "fading," lacking the required contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The narrative functions as a fable with flat archetypes (the Wise Grandmother, the Scientist) rather than a dramatized character study under pressure. There is no agonizing choice; Marina simply persists until she succeeds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The piece relies entirely on summary and montage ("By the third morning," "Slowly, cautiously," "six months later") rather than a continuous scene, violating scope defaults. The resolution is unearned by narrative struggle; the scientist solves the central problem instantly upon receiving samples, removing causal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Visuals are vivid ("crimson sky," "floating stone arches"), providing a distinct backdrop. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; the "floating" nature of the arches does not constrain tactical choices or pressure the blight narrative in a mechanical way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Conflict is described in exposition ("suspicious clusters") rather than dramatized in a scene where opposing values clash. The stakes are high in theory but low on the page, as the solution (trust) is accepted by the community without a visible moment of resistance or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing, with the protagonist literally writing the moral ("Strangers built this world... Family saved it") on the ground. This overt didacticism flattens subtext and prevents any nuanced engagement with the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, maintaining a distant but gentle tone. However, the lack of close psychic distance prevents emotional resonance, and the dialogue provided is purely functional exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is competent and clear, with some strong phrasing ("brambled hope"), though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("despair made visible"). The density is adequate, but the reliance on summary prevents rhythmic acceleration during key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost healing a sci-fi orchard via fungal networks is imaginative, but the execution falls into standard "heartwarming fable" tropes. The lack of a fresh, gritty, or complex emotional turn limits the story's ingenuity.</comment>
