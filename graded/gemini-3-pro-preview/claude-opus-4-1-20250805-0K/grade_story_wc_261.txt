<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya is a distinct, compelled protagonist; her decision to drill tunnels into her scars is a radical, specific choice that drives the narrative. The shift from seeking closure to accepting "openness" is well-charted, though the telepathic "download" of information from the plants slightly dampens her active struggle in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, moving from observation to epiphany with a legible Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. However, the resolution relies heavily on the plants explicitly "showing" her the answer, which reduces the causal friction and makes the epiphany feel slightly too smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is actively used; the tower provides the necessary vantage point, and the "micro-setting" of the coffee ring and scar tissue charges the final image effectively. The dawn light and the garden below are not just atmospheric but instrumental to the telepathic connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the stakes (the nature of miracles) are high, the immediate pressure is low; the mystery resolves almost immediately upon looking out the window. The antagonist is merely "silence," and the plants dissolve the conflict by providing the answer, removing the potential for error or struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme is resonant and unified, but the ending leans into didactic summary ("It wasn't about closure at all, but about remaining open..."). The explicit statement of the moral reduces the subtextual power of the final image, doing work that the narrative should have left to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct signature ("vegetable grief," "libraries written in collagen"). The perspective is stable, though there is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Maya felt," "Maya knew") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("water seeping through stone"). However, the sentence structure often falls into a repetitive subject-verb cadence ("She lay," "She sat," "Maya stood"), and the pervasive filtering dulls the immediacy of the epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central premise—drilling microscopic tunnels in scar tissue to decode healing—is inventive and visceral. The synthesis of medical body horror, botanical telepathy, and metaphysical wonder creates a unique and memorable narrative logic.</comment>
