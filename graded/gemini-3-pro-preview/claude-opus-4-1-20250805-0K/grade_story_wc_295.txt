<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mira and Hayashi are distinct, but Mira's core trait ("healing with words") is applied to the plot in a confusing, metaphorical way—it is unclear how speech therapy skills allow one to decode variable star light curves. This makes her competence feel unearned. The emotional progression to acceptance is smooth but lacks internal friction; the "burden" is stated rather than felt through resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from discovery to realization and acceptance. The inciting incident (finding the telegram) works well, though relying on a 43-year-old message surfacing "now" is a convenient trigger. Closure is legible as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, satisfying the prompt's structural requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "whisper of starlight" and the brass telescope grounding the scene effectively. The physical props (yellowed telegram, translucent daylily) are rendered with specific sensory detail that enhances the tone. The environment successfully frames the cosmic scale of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the conceptual stakes are high (warnings of supernovae/flares), the immediate dramatic pressure is low. The characters accept the "burden" with very little struggle or cost on the page; the danger of "madness" is mentioned as backstory but not threatened in the scene. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily over-explained. The narrator explicitly decodes the symbol of the daylily for the reader ("bloomed for exactly one day, like human comprehension"), and the dialogue declares the moral thesis ("We document, we preserve"). This lack of subtext and trust in the reader significantly reduces literary resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining meanings that should be left implicit. The dialogue drifts into speechifying ("The stars don't wait," "We carry this together now"), which flattens the characters into mouthpieces for the theme rather than people in a crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished but relies on some clichés ("whale song," "scientific skepticism crumbling") and abstract summaries. The "healing words" metaphor muddies the causal logic at the line level. There is a tendency to "tell" emotional states ("weight of shared exhaustion") rather than evoking them through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of variable stars as a long-term communication medium is imaginative and engaging. However, the execution falls into familiar tropes of the "secret lineage of watchers" and the "clue hidden in a book." The story is competent but plays it safe with its speculative elements.</comment>
