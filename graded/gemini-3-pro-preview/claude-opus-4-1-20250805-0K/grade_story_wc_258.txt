<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vera functions as a competent professional solving a puzzle, but lacks the internal contradiction or difficult choices required for higher bands. Her "steadily curious" nature is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a decision that carries cost or risk. The interaction with Marcus is purely transactional and expository, lacking status dynamics or emotional friction. The character serves the concept rather than the concept testing the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure ("Scooby-Doo" unmasking) without genuine causal pressure or setbacks. The closure is a realization (Conceptual Repricing) that the network is an archive, but this arrives via explanation rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The climax relies on two characters agreeing on an interpretation of data, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, establishing a vivid "cyber-noir" atmosphere with specific details like the onyx-ink cards and carbonized hard drives. The "rain-beaded skylight" and "amber streetlight" effectively ground the scene, though the environment functions mostly as a mood setter rather than a source of constraint or resources. The integration of the measuring tape as a tool for divination anchors the abstract concept well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes are purely informational and abstract; there is no immediate threat to Vera or Marcus if they fail to solve the pattern. The conflict is an intellectual puzzle resolved through exposition, lacking a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something or make a high-stakes trade-off. The "escalation" is merely the unveiling of information, devoid of personal or physical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue at the climax ("value isn't stored in coins..."), triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo. Rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from action or subtext, the story delivers a moral lecture that flattens the narrative resonance. The "inherited mystery" aspect is present but feels like a vehicle for the thesis rather than an organic exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, but the dialogue suffers from "as-you-know" exposition ("You're suggesting...", "Not suggesting, proving"). The characters speak in similar academic registers, primarily to convey information to the reader rather than to pursue distinct emotional goals. The POV remains stable, but the lack of distinct voice texture in dialogue limits the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with some strong imagery ("sleeping snake," "flowing river"), but suffers from repetitive rain motifs ("rain drummed," "rain-slick," "rain from his coat," "rain intensified," "rain continued"). Phrases like "algorithmic intervals" tell rather than show the complexity of the magic system. The line-level craft is competent but leans into purple descriptions that occasionally slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept of "technomancy"—using carbonized hard drives for ink and mapping digital migrations—is inventive and specific. However, the execution falls into standard procedural tropes where the magic system is explained to an observer. The "Jakarta network" detail adds nice specificity, but the overall shape of the story is a familiar "expert explains mystery" template.</comment>
