<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lila is active and her motivation is clear, but her final choice to "upload" herself feels unearned; the narrative skips the emotional weight and human hesitation of ending one's physical existence, rendering the climax mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story breaks its own genre rules, leaping from grounded data forensics to magical biological digitization without setup; the causal link between an astronaut in space and a social network's deletion algorithm is incoherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "between floors" setting effectively grounds the surreal premise, and the atmosphere of the server farm is rendered with sensory precision, though the "shadow network" remains spatially vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The stakes shift from professional to existential, but the absence of active opposition makes the investigation feel low-pressure; the final cost is theoretical rather than felt, as Lila abandons her life too easily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of digital persistence is coherent, though the "we are not missing, we are archived" realization leans on familiar tropes without complicating the moral implications of this digital afterlife.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the noir-tech atmosphere, though it struggles to sell the sudden shift to surrealism at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by tech inaccuracies (RGB values cannot naturally be 4827) and purple phrasing ("sang in mathematical harmony") that distracts from the grounded opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a "digital ghost" and the twist of a lost father found in the machine are genre staples; the story executes them competently but offers no fresh subversion or unique angle.</comment>
