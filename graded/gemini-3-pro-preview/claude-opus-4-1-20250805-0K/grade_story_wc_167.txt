<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus possesses a distinct, profession-based worldview ("seeing stress fractures") that grounds the narrative. However, the internal arc lacks sufficient friction; his progression from regret to wisdom feels linear and inevitable, missing the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands. He functions more as a vessel for the theme than a character making difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building sensory detail toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is legible—he accepts the loss of the physical space to preserve the lesson—but the transition is somewhat smooth. The pacing is effective, though the "noctilucent" exposition slightly drags the opening orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the prism atrium, mist, and dawn light actively constrain the protagonist’s realization. The specific geometry of the glass and water is not just backdrop but the mechanism of the epiphany. The atmosphere is vivid and tightly integrated with the glazier’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the stakes of losing the shop are established, the on-page pressure is low. The conflict is largely contemplative, resolved through observation rather than a high-cost decision or struggle. The external threat (bulldozers) is static, and the internal resolution feels like a gentle surrender rather than a hard-won pivot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily over-articulated in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "understanding finally that surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces of possibility" and "lesson would remain: that complexity lived in clarity" explain the subtext directly to the reader, reducing resonance. This explicit moralizing triggers a significant deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated tone appropriate for the character’s expertise. The "glazier’s eye" filter is well-maintained ("language written in probability"). Narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally dips into expository interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery is often striking ("clung to the water like oil," "nodes that rose and fell like breathing"). However, the prose relies on filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "He realized") to convey meaning rather than dramatization. The "physics made visible, mathematics made beautiful" line leans toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The choice of a glazier interpreting interference patterns offers a fresh lens on the familiar "gentrification/loss of legacy" trope. The synthesis of wave physics and glasswork is ingenious, though the execution is slightly hampered by the prompt-mandated phrasing.</comment>
