<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation (legacy vs. survival) is clear, but the pivotal change relies on a convenient epiphany ("The frost itself was teaching her") rather than pressure-cooked agency. The decision to warn others forecloses the "disappear" option, but the emotional struggle is smoothed over by the reflective mode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The structure is solid, moving from the ledger revelation to a Decisive Change (keeping the list to warn others). Backstory density is high but anchors the stakes; the closure lands with a legible shift in tactics, though the "warning" plan emerges somewhat easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frost and charred paper provide a specific, tactile micro-setting that grounds the epiphany. The interaction between the ice crystals and the burnt ledger effectively bridges the physical environment and the internal realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are established (erasure vs. dangerous truth), but the scene lacks immediate external pressure, relying on internal processing. The escalation comes from memory rather than active scene friction; the final choice is a valid turn but feels relatively low-cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("No radiation needed," "beauty born from poison," "ambition's true price") rather than subtext. The "nature as teacher" realization is told directly to the reader, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and unified, fitting the reflective tone. However, it occasionally lapses into explaining the character's internal state ("knowing whoever wanted her father's records would assume...") rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but leans on clichés ("canyon walls held their breath," "punctured by stars") and abstractions ("scorched testament"). The lyrical attempts occasionally obscure the moment with melodrama ("daily surrender to sunrise").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The uranium glass hook is compelling and specific, but the resolution—finding a new, safe artistic path through nature's patterns at dawn—follows a familiar, safe literary template. The execution is competent but lacks a surprising synthesis.</comment>
