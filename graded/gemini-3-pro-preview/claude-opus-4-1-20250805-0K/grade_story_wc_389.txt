<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlowe is a consistent, legible focalizer who drives the narrative, but she lacks the internal contradiction required for higher bands. Her "variant allegiance" is stated rather than tested by a difficult on-page choice, resulting in a character who performs a function rather than struggling with a human cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building pressure through the storm to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. While the arc is solid, the causal path is low-resistance; the protagonist succeeds without a significant setback or twist, making the resolution feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the cobalt glass portico is not just scenery but a filter that colors perception and action. The specific sensory details ("cerulean shadows," "clouds speaking binary") ground the high-concept premise effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation is present via the intensifying storm, but the stakes remain abstract. Marlowe battles the elements, but she faces no genuine dilemma or trade-off; the lack of a "felt price" or sacrifice limits the emotional impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but resolves with a heavy hand. The Prophet's final line ("The old world ends not with apocalypse...") is an explicit thematic summary that flattens the subtext, triggering the penalty for moralizing in the final beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a high-lyric register that suits the "lonely visionary" archetype. It remains stable throughout, though the relentless poeticism risks distancing the reader from the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm. However, the text relies heavily on metaphor ("history's lungs," "taste copper and rebellion"), occasionally prioritizing lyrical flourish over clarity, which creates a slight drag on momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio astronomy and mysticism offers a distinct flavor, and the "variant allegiance" concept is fresh. The execution leans into familiar "magical realism" tropes, but the specific combination of elements feels organic.</comment>
