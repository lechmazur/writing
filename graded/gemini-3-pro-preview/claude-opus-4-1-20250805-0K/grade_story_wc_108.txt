<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus creates a functional center, but the antagonist, Jake, operates as a stock villain with melodramatic dialogue ("Submit to reset protocol") that flattens the conflict. The shift from fear to empowerment feels rushed and intellectualized rather than viscerally earned in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The inciting incident is clear, but the resolution relies on a "magic wand" causality: decoding equations on a cast allows Marcus to instantly reverse a physical shell's resonance via his phone. This lack of logical friction robs the climax of mechanical weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library offers strong, atmospheric grounding with sensory details like the smell of rotting paper and the chill of the metal. The "stellar dust" image is evocative, though it borders on purple given the otherwise grounded setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are established, but the escalation deflates because the protagonist enters the confrontation with a perfect, pre-calculated counter-move. There is no on-page struggle or cost paid during the climax; the victory is immediate and absolute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on explicit statement rather than subtext, violating the Thematic Echo penalty by having the protagonist whisper the thesis ("Vulnerability is power") directly to the antagonist. The theme is lectured rather than emerging organically from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and competent, but the dialogue drifts into artificial villain tropes that damage naturalism. The transition from the stunt double persona to the "awakened" self is narrated smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and readable, though occasionally overwrought ("seep through his skin like a promise"). Prompt phrases ("firmly adaptive," "trembling certainty") are inserted visibly rather than woven invisibly into the texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "stunt double as synthetic test subject" is a fresh and compelling premise. However, the execution falls back on a standard "confronting the creator" showdown with a technobabble resolution.</comment>
