<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara is a competent, focused protagonist whose expertise grounds the fantastical elements. Her interiority is consistent, though the stakes feel somewhat academic; the cost of her decision to document rather than repair is intellectual rather than visceral, lacking deep emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the broken state is revalued. The "future echo" provides a neat, circular causality that fits the premise, though the resolution leans heavily on internal realization rather than external consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the marble cavern and sunlight are not just backdrop but active tools in Mara's method (camera obscura). The physical properties of the space—light, acoustics, and mineral composition—meaningfully constrain and enable her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent but low-key; the impending end of the "wounded season" creates a soft deadline. The conflict is primarily philosophical (order vs. wonder), and while the tightening is perceptible, the lack of an antagonist or harder trade-off limits the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder through brokenness is compelling but undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs. The narrative pivots to explaining its own thesis ("She would know that wonder could be preserved...") rather than letting the image of the blueprint speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and measured, matching the atmospheric content perfectly. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying close to Mara's professional perception without slipping into unearned omniscience or melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("frozen lightning," "instruction manual written backward"). The rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though there is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the reflective moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central concept of a "wounded season" and fixing time via reflection is fresh and imaginatively executed. The inversion of the locksmith's role—preserving the malfunction rather than the fix—is a clever, non-obvious turn that elevates the story.</comment>
