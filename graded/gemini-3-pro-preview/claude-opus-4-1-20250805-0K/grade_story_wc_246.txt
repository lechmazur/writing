<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict between guilt and scientific integrity is palpable, driving the narrative effectively. While the "confidently uncertain" trait feels slightly inserted as a label rather than purely demonstrated, her final choice to relinquish control authentically culminates her arc. The connection to the grandfather provides a functional, if slightly convenient, emotional anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with the rescue ship's arrival providing effective causal pressure. The resolution—transmitting both coordinates—is a clever "Situational" closure that leverages the established mechanics of observer-dependent reality. The logic holds together well, offering a Decisive Change in stance that feels earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fountain pen serves as an excellent micro-setting object that grounds the cosmic scale in personal history. The station itself is somewhat generic ("curved walls," "observation chamber"), but the visual description of the anomaly's lensing effects adds necessary texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and high—30,000 lives versus the integrity of reality. The arrival of the rescue ship creates immediate, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist to act. The cost is abstract but felt: the surrender of a guaranteed "happy ending" for a truthful, uncertain one.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The exploration of guilt and edited memory is compelling, but the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. The final sentence ("sometimes the wrong seeds...") summarizes the theme rather than letting the image resonate, triggering a penalty for Thematic Echo/explanation in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending technical competence with philosophical introspection effectively. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining close third-person intimacy with Mira’s thought process without head-hopping or confusing shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent and clear, though occasionally leans into sci-fi clichés ("constellations of data," "raw manuscript of spacetime"). The rhythm is good, but the reliance on slightly purple descriptors prevents the line-level work from reaching the highest tier of freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "quantum observer" trope with a personal redemption arc is handled well. While the "reality editor" concept is familiar in the genre, the specific resolution—creating a superposition of choices for the captain—offers a satisfyingly distinct twist.</comment>
