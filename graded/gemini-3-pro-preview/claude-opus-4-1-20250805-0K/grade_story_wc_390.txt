<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is a competent focalizer, and her internal duality (logic vs. ancestral memory) is established quickly. However, her arc is linear execution of a pre-decided plan; there is little on-page hesitation or struggle between competing values, making the sacrifice feel inevitable rather than actively chosen in the moment. The "Collectors" remain faceless forces rather than a relationship-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative drive is clear and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the signal—lands with visible cost. The timing of the antagonists' arrival (bursting in exactly at the moment of completion) is a standard thriller convenience that slightly softens the Causal lens. The logic of the ritual is handled well within the established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "drift-ice marina" is distinct, tactile, and integral to the plot. Sensory details like the "frozen metal" and the "honey and blood" sunset ground the ethereal elements effectively. The environment actively constrains the action and necessitates the specific solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly communicated, involving both immediate survival and long-term safety. The escalation relies on a simple ticking clock (sunset/Collectors) rather than a deepening of interpersonal or complex obstacles. The cost of the final choice is high (loss of physical form), though the lack of an alternative option reduces the agency of the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice and becoming one with duty resonates well through the final image. The concept of "sonic absolution" is integrated into the narrative logic rather than just being a prompt keyword. The ending avoids heavy moralizing, letting the image of the "shimmer of blue" carry the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching the "fleshly ethereal" tone requirement. The shift from technical observation to mythic resonance is handled smoothly. There are no POV slips, and the distance is managed well to show Mira's internal state during the transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset") and vague similes ("wings of forgotten birds"). The phrase "electronic hunger" feels slightly abstract compared to the concrete grounding elsewhere. The line-level craft supports the tone but draws attention to itself in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a lighthouse keeper becoming the light is a familiar trope in speculative fiction, though the sonic/ice angle adds a fresh texture. The synthesis of prompt elements is organic, but the narrative beats follow a predictable "race against time to sacrifice" structure.</comment>
