<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to decode the past is grounded in specific action (tapping), and the connection to her grandmother provides solid agency. However, her pivotal realization relies on internal summary ("Lena finally understood") rather than embodied reaction, distancing the reader at the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Decisive Change (lowering the station to dive) that follows the Accumulative lens of the "symphony." The logic holds, though the expository paragraph explaining the "revelation" slows the momentum right before the final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The auditory specifics of the station (glass singing, metal ringing) effectively turn the setting into a tool for discovery. The isolation above the water constrains options well, though the visual description of "shadows" is less distinct than the soundscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—official data vs. hidden truth—and escalate from observation to a life-altering physical commitment. The "shadows moving" beat adds a somewhat generic mystery pressure compared to the more unique rhythmic investigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of "translation" rather than death drives a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end, recontextualizing the tragedy. The theme lands with resonance, only capped by the slight over-explanation in the narrative summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and reflective, matching the story's rhythmic motif. However, distance control slips in the final third, shifting into an explanatory mode ("Everyone saw death...") that feels more authorial than character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While sensory imagery is often vivid ("glass sang high"), the climax suffers from filter verbs and expository scaffolding ("Lena finally understood," "The revelation had been delayed"). These artifacts flatten the immediacy of the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate grief with a sonic investigation method offers a fresh angle on the submerged city trope. The "translation" concept elevates the material, though the geometric shadows and diary discovery are familiar genre beats.</comment>
