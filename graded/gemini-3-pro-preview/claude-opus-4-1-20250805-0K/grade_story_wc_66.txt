<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mariel is a competent vessel for the plot with no internal friction or contradictory impulses; her lack of fear and the diagnostic labeling of her emotion ("thistled calm") flatten the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a predictive summary at the end ("Audience members would breathe...") which resolves the tension via exposition rather than leaving the charged potential of the delivered scores to speak for itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "ember alcove" and the constraint of the radio dial's amber light create a vivid, intimate atmosphere that grounds the magical elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The only on-page obstacle is a wavering signal resolved instantly by patience; with no hard choice or sacrificed resource, the stakes remain theoretical despite the declared danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The poignant motif of memory-dust is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph, where the narrator summarizes the thematic thesis instead of allowing the image to resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but leans heavily on exposition to explain the magic system ("Mariel had discovered...") and the history, creating a distance from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasional purple phrases ("narrative spores") and the tendency to explain effects ("dreams would return") reduce line-level tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio transcription and magical dust is inventive, though the "story famine" backdrop feels familiar; the execution is solid but safe.</comment>
