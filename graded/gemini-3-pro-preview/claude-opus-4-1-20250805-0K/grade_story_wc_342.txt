<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is consistent, but her agency is limited to executing a pre-determined plan using a found map; the "discovery" of limits is summarized rather than dramatized through struggle. The prosopagnosia serves more as a thematic superpower than a constraint that forces difficult trade-offs on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves thematic closure, but relies on a convenient backstory discovery ("She'd already discovered") that lowers present-action tension. The plot functions as a linear procedural toward a known goal rather than a causal chain of escalating choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "tree trunk library" is rendered with vivid, tactile specificity ("grooves worn smooth," "sawdust," "bark"). The atmosphere of the hollowed oak effectively grounds the abstract concept of the light portrait.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conflict is largely external (the deadline) and static; the protagonist faces no significant active opposition or dilemma during the scene. The resolution comes from following instructions on the coin rather than through a high-stakes decision or costly sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and non-visual identity is resonant, though the execution leans on explicit statements ("Lyra understood now," "faces were merely one form") rather than subtext. The final image of carrying the sky inside effectively lands the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, somewhat reverent tone appropriate for the subject matter. The narrative voice effectively mediates the sensory shift from sight to touch/spatial awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished but relies on several clichés ("crystalline clarity," "wind held its breath") that dull the imagery. While the rhythm is generally good, some descriptions feel slightly overwritten ("condemned cathedral of knowledge") rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a light-portrait based on a tactile coin map is imaginative and pairs well with the tree-library setting. The execution transforms the "blind seer" trope enough to feel fresh, though the lack of narrative friction limits its impact.</comment>
