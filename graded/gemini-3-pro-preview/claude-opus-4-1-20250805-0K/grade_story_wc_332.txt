<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is established, but the climax relies on diagnostic internalization ("spending her own capacity") rather than embodied sensation, abstracting the emotional cost. The internal conflict is resolved through sudden realization rather than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causality is robust; the magic system is taught efficiently and pays off in a decisive renunciation. The structure manages the backstory and present action well, delivering a clear closure unit where the protagonist alters her path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago and the specific light conditions at dawn are integral to the plot, constraining the magic effectively. The atmosphere is vivid, though relying occasionally on standard descriptors like "molten copper."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and escalate cleanly; the trade-off between fulfilling the grandmother's dream and preserving Mara's own vitality creates a legible, felt cost at the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of recognizing rather than resurrecting the past is coherent, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("Some longings, she understood now..."), which flattens the subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, managing the shift from observational description to internal decision without distinct breaks. The tone matches the magical realism of the premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with clear momentum. However, the reliance on slightly familiar imagery ("eyes the color of deep water") and the explanatory nature of the ending hold it back from the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of "painting with light" using glass shards to vitalize memory is an inventive and visual synthesis of the prompt elements, offering a fresh take on the trope of unlived lives.</comment>
