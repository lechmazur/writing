<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yula is a consistent focalizer, but her characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("historically reverent nature") and backstory summary rather than active struggle in the present. Her defining trait—stillness—renders her static; the "choice" to respond to the echo is a confirmation of mastery rather than a decision forged under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative loop is coherent, and the closure (the pulse revealing itself as her own past voice) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the stakes are low; the "cost" of her 300-year vigil is established as a sunk cost in backstory, leaving the on-page climax without a palpable price or risk of failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "canyon of endless echoes" and bone towers provide a distinct, physically constraining environment that is essential to the plot's acoustic logic. The sensory details—calcified remains, the warmth of the arrowhead—effectively ground the abstract premise of navigating time through sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal and purely conceptual; the "wandering pulse" is a curiosity to be solved rather than a pressure that forces a difficult trade-off or tests Yula's resolve. The escalation tracks proximity, not danger, resulting in a serene but low-stakes vignette that lacks dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The central theme of "stillness as movement" is evocative but undercut by explicit moralizing in the finale ("learned that the greatest journey was the one that required no steps at all"). This summarizes the subtext for the reader instead of trusting the resonant image of the returning voice to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register that suits the "deep time" scope of the story. It occasionally lapses into explanatory distance ("She understood that true navigation happened in stillness"), placing a filter between the reader and Yula's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("stretched like a wound," "sheet music written across the sky"). However, telling artifacts ("Yula's historically reverent nature demanded...") and the summarizing final didacticism flatten the poetic impact of the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept—applying the physics of stone skimming to navigating time via acoustics—is highly original and vividly realized. While the "it was me all along" time-loop resolution is a familiar trope, the specific mechanism of using bird patterns and bone resonance to decode history feels fresh.</comment>
