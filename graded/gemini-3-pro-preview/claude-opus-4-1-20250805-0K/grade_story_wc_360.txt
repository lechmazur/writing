<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is defined primarily by her function and the abstract concept of her empathy rather than specific, grounded choices. The conflict between borrowed personalities ("merchant's pragmatism wrestled with a child's wonder") is summarized as a list of labels rather than dramatized through contradictory actions or distinct internal voices battling for control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows a clear accumulative arc fueled by the dying stars, leading to a legitimate Conceptual Repricing closure where the nature of emotion is redefined. The transition from "mathematics" to "typography" provides a satisfying intellectual click, though the causal trigger for this specific epiphany feels slightly convenient ("sudden clarity") rather than forced by an unavoidable pressure point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and the vanishing constellation create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that acts effectively as a narrative clock. The sensory details ("silver ink," "crystalline walls") are specific and integral to the printing process, grounding the metaphysical concepts in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pressure is consistent, driven by the cosmic clock of the dying stars, but the stakes remain largely internal and abstract. While the loss of self is mentioned, the protagonist seems to glide into the fragmentation without significant resistance or tangible cost, lowering the felt tension of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central theme of translation—emotion to math to typography—is handled with sophistication, culminating in a resonant final image ("seventeen different mouths"). The subversion of the prompt's motivation (realizing it isn't math) adds depth, moving beyond a simple execution of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic tone of the piece. The distance is well-calibrated, though at times the "lucid turbulence" leads to a density of abstraction that slightly distances the reader from Mira's immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic ("mechanical heartbeat," "solutions to the equation"), but occasionally lapses into "purple" mathematical metaphors that obscure rather than clarify ("grief multiplied by infinity," "square root of abandonment"). These abstract constructions reduce the visceral impact of the otherwise strong imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics with celestial decay and emotional calculus is fresh and imaginative. The "typography as emotion" conceit offers a genuine intellectual turn that elevates the prompt's components beyond their literal definitions.</comment>
