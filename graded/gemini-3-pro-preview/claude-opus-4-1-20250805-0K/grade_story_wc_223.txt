<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to document the "small gestures" is compelling and specifically grounded in her backstory as a "crisis actor," creating a strong internal engine. Her refusal of the visitor's offer is consistent with her established characterization, though the interiority occasionally leans on diagnostic phrasing (e.g., "benevolently ruthless") rather than purely embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and decisive, utilizing the single scene to crystallize a stance against the new government's narrative. The closure is excellent, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina's refusal and return to her "walking" recontextualizes her isolation as a position of power and truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is utilized masterfully, not just as backdrop but as a tool for the dialogue and a metaphor for the protagonist's mission. The acoustics and the chessboard constrain the interaction and charge the final image, fulfilling the requirements for the highest tier of setting integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes are clear—narrative integrity versus political legitimacy—and the arrival of the visitor forces a meaningful choice. While the external pressure is resolved somewhat quickly with the visitor's retreat, the internal cost of remaining in the "shadowland" is well-dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "unbinding memory from myth" resonates powerfully through the "crisis actor" inversion, turning a conspiracy trope into a statement on witnessing. The ending avoids simple moralizing, instead offering a resonant image of endurance ("W-E R-E-M-A-I-N") that feels earned by the preceding action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the "historian" persona. The transition between the lyrical descriptions of the gallery and the sharper, more cynical dialogue with the visitor is handled smoothly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-quality with strong rhythm and imagery ("ghosts of legislation"). However, a few metaphors feel slightly overworked (rats holding votes) or self-consciously literary, which occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "crisis actor" conspiracy theory with a genuine survivor's trauma in a post-conflict setting is a highly original and effective premise. The specific method of "walking words" adds a unique layer of performative witnessing that feels fresh and thematically tight.</comment>
