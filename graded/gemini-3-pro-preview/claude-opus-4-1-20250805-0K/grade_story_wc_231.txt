<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnus is a compelling focalizer whose interiority is rendered with distinct, sensory metaphors ("trying on wet clothes"). His emotional arc—from professional curiosity to personal devastation and finally to a reconfigured peace—is coherent and moving. The realization regarding his son relies heavily on intuitive leaps, but the emotional logic holds firmly within his established isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, with a brilliant causal linkage between the lighthouse's rotation and the memory gaps. However, the pivotal realization—connecting scratched dates on a dock immediately to the stranger being his son returning stolen memories—is a significant knowledge leap that feels more like an authorial reveal than a deduction earned purely by scene cues. Closure is strong, effectively recontextualizing the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the lighthouse is not just scenery but a mechanical constraint that unlocks the mystery (aligning rotation with memory gaps). The "opal dock" serves as both a physical platform for the clues and an atmospheric anchor. Vivid sensory details ("salt-cracked palm," "churning gray waters") create a tactile reality that grounds the magical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes escalate cleanly from an abstract mystery to a deeply personal tragedy, shifting the burden of the "curse" into a gift of connection. The cost is palpable—decades of lost time and the son's sacrifice—and is felt on the page. The internal pressure mounts effectively as the investigation narrows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a burden versus a gift is explored with sophistication, culminating in the powerful inversion of suicide into baptism. The concept of "gaps" representing preservation rather than absence offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central melancholy. Subtext is handled well, particularly in the description of the "wrong" flower.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, assured, and appropriately melancholic, utilizing a lexicon that fits the nautical/memory-keeper persona perfectly. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader close to Magnus's perception without slipping into unmotivated omniscience. The transition from observation to epiphany is smoothed by the strength of the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with standout imagery ("stretched into fog like a severed finger") that serves the tone. There is a slight tendency toward over-explanation in the climax ("The final gesture hadn't been suicide but baptism"), but the line-level craft is generally excellent. The repetition of the prompt phrase "softly persistent" is noticeable but functionally integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with the mechanical rotation of a lighthouse is a genuinely fresh mechanic. While the "long-lost child" reveal is a classic trope, the specific context—returning memories stolen by a spouse—twists it into something original and emotionally distinct.</comment>
