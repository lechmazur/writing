<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a living character; his motivation is authorially stated ("This was his method") and his contentment lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative forms a coherent textural vignette ending in Earned Stasis, but lacks the causal tightening or decisive turn required for higher bands; the loop structure is competent but static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean setting is tactile and vivid ("third rail sang," "rusted ladder"), effectively grounding the surreal premise with specific sensory details that charge the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal as Eleanor is a compliant participant in the fantasy; the interaction lacks opposition, risk, or a moment where the "estrangement" is genuinely tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Resonance is undercut by heavy-handed aphorisms ("Every ending is just a beginning") and explicit thematic moralizing in the final paragraph that replaces narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, successfully maintaining the melancholic tone, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("liminal space," "silence how to speak").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and readable, though slightly purple in descriptors; the insertion of the required phrase "melodically haunted" feels mechanical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the glass harmonica's specific acoustics with the subway setting creates a fresh aesthetic texture, even if the "comforting the lost" trope is familiar.</comment>
