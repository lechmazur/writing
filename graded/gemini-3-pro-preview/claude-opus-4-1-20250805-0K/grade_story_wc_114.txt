<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is distinct, blending technical meteorological knowledge with the metaphysical "oracle" trait effectively ("swallowed this truth," "incorporating it"). The choice to smudge the signature is a strong character-defining action that earns the stasis of the ending. The "oracle" gift risks being a convenience, but the physical grounding in "frost-numbed fingers" and fever symptoms keeps it embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from the fever's aftermath to a verified discovery and a decisive closure act (the smudging). The ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the "margins" not as neglect but as protection. Causality is driven by the protagonist's specific perception, though the initial discovery relies slightly on the "gift" as a shortcut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and integral, moving beyond backdrop to become a participant in the bloom. Specific details like "curling from condensation" and "green-gold ribbons" anchor the supernatural elements in tactile reality. The station's isolation mirrors the "margins" theme perfectly, enhancing the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The internal pressure to verify the truth before descent drives the scene effectively. While external opposition is absent (the colleagues have already left), the environmental pressure of the aurora and the physical toll of the fever provide sufficient stakes. The "trembling hands" and calibration sequence offer a tangible escalation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic integration of "fault tolerance," "margins," and "impossible flowers" is exceptional, turning a technical term into a profound philosophical stance. The final image of the smudged signature resonates deeply with the concept of protected truths. (Score capped at 8.8 due to Global 9+ Gate linking Q5 ceiling to Q2 score).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical but precise register that suits the "oracle" persona. The shift from scientific observation to numinous experience is handled without breaking narrative distance. Occasional phrasing leans slightly purple ("intimate sorrow"), but it coheres with the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sentence rhythm. A minor artifact appears with the phrase "peripherally aware," which feels mechanically inserted twice to satisfy the prompt, creating a slight repetitive drag. Otherwise, the line-level craft supports the story's ethereal weight well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of botany, geomagnetism, and oracular intuition creates a fresh, specific metaphor for hidden knowledge. The concept of flowers that bloom only in "electromagnetic sorrow" is a genuinely ingenious image that elevates the familiar "secret diary" trope.</comment>
