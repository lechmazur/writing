<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yann’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing the burden of her "curse" with her duty. The shift from herder to guardian is earned through the revelation, offering a clear emotional reconfiguration. The specific mechanics of her precognition (seeing three heartbeats ahead) add distinct texture to her perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from ritual to revelation to re-commitment with clear causality. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing of the world’s state. The orientation and pacing are effective, though the "flashback" within the vision risks slowing momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospherically strong, but the central premise ("frictionless age") lacks tactile consistency. Yann manipulates stones and stands on a bluff without addressing the immense physical difficulty of doing so without friction (traction, grip). The setting feels more like a magical backdrop than a world governed by the stated physical change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively internalized; the cost of the "curse" is palpable and recontextualized by the end. The tension is quiet and epistemic rather than physical, but the resolution—accepting a lifetime of waiting—provides a satisfying, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of resistance vs. flow is handled with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The reinterpretation of the "broken" world as a return to an "original state" creates a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. The shift between the immediate sensory experience and the cosmic scope of the vision is handled smoothly without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic ("borrowed dawn," "ribbons descending"). Some descriptors lean slightly generic ("something more complex," "luminous with understanding"), but the density of information and image is generally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blend of quasi-physics and mythic eel-herding is creative. However, the selective application of the "frictionless" rule (applying to water/eels but not rocks/feet) undermines the ingenuity of the speculative premise, making it feel like soft fantasy disguised as sci-fi.</comment>
