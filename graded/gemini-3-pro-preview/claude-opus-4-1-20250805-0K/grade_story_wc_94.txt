<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is distinctly rendered, blending artistic necessity with political resistance. Interiority is rich and specific to her role as a poet-astronomer. The prompt-mandated attribute "furiously tranquil" is told rather than purely embodied, but her steady work amidst the storm effectively dramatizes her stoicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The structural use of the darkroom timer creates a solid rhythmic backbone for the scene, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The reliance on a discovery from three weeks ago places the true inciting incident in backstory, slightly lowering immediate narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting; the observatory is not just a backdrop but the engine of the story's central metaphor and physical action (light-writing). The contrast between the storm below and the stars above actively charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and thematic, driven by the vigil and the storm's escalation. The stakes are high (exile, erasure), but the immediate on-page conflict is largely internal and maintenance-based rather than a sharp, evolving tactical crisis. The "vigil" mode justifies this but limits dynamic range.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of "cartography of scars" is deeply resonant. However, the narrative tends to explicitly articulate its themes ("The irony wasn't lost on her," "revealing precisely what the state couldn't bear"), turning subtext into text. This over-explanation slightly dampens the power of the imagery itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, perfectly matching the protagonist's identity as a celebrated poet. The transition between technical darkroom details and abstract poetic thought is seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("lightning carved silver veins"). There is a slight tendency toward purple phrasing ("applause from the universe," "electric kiss"), but the rhythm and line-level control are generally strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core conceit—developing censored manuscripts into new poems using starlight and photographic negatives—is a brilliantly specific and original synthesis. It revitalizes the familiar "censored artist" trope with a fresh, tactile mechanic.</comment>
