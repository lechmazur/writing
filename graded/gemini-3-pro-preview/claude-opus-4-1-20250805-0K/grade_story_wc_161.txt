<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Margot is distinct, but her internal arc is largely summarized through seasonal metaphors ("winter's quiet work," "learning to trust") rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure. The "withering" to "blooming" trajectory feels observed from a distance rather than lived on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The structure relies heavily on a montage of passing time ("Three months ago," "By summer," "One evening") rather than a continuous scene or tight shards, which dilutes immediate tension. The resolution depends on a high-magnitude coincidence (Theodore's wife happened to be Margot's former employer) rather than causal action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The attic setting is rendered with strong sensory detail—dust motes, golden light, rust-red meteorite—that mirrors Margot's internal state. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the tone well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established in backstory but rarely tested in the present; the conflict of reputation and healing is resolved through the passive passage of time and a serendipitous gift. There is little active on-page struggle or cost paid by the protagonist in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of reinvention and "truth in the margins" is coherent but delivered somewhat explicitly through the narrator's summary. The final resonance is sweet but leans on sentimental assertion rather than earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the period setting. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought phrasing ("blooming with suspicion") but generally maintains a stable, atmospheric distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic. There is a tendency toward summary-style sentence structures ("She began her work by...", "Theodore noticed..."), but the line-level craft is solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of elements (pigeons, Mars rock, archive) provides a fresh texture, but the "healing in a quiet bookshop" narrative arc and the coincidence-based resolution feel familiar and safe.</comment>
