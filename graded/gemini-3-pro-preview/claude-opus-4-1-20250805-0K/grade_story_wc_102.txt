<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mae is a functional protagonist with a clear goal ("finding where unused love is stored") but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her actions are largely procedural responses to external prompts (memory, ghost's instruction) rather than active choices made under pressure. The emotional landscape is described ("copper of ancient heartbreak") rather than dramatized through behavior or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The structure is legible and the closure (releasing the photos) lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's purpose. However, causality relies heavily on destiny-driven conveniences—the sudden "past life memory" and the impulse purchase of the tear "without knowing why"—which weakens the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("wisteria," "brass fittings"), establishing a strong atmospheric mood. However, the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("prayer written in stone," "compressed starlight") that blurs the physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Escalation is present (sparks -> ghost -> door), but the narrative lacks genuine opposition or tension; the ritual succeeds without complication or risk. The final cost (giving up the photos) is a nice conceptual beat, but it feels more like a destined conclusion than a hard-won price paid after struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered explicitly through dialogue ("They're all here, waiting to heal the world..."), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is thin because the story articulates its meaning directly rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the magical realist genre. The narrative distance is controlled, though the "foggy lucidity" descriptor borders on oxymoronic confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from "purple" density ("ribbons of light... like silk scarves," "compressed starlight"). While technically sound, the reliance on flowery metaphors occasionally obscures the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The use of a camera obscura as a tool for spiritual mediumship is a fresh, specific detail that elevates the concept. However, the "repository of unused love" and the "ghost guiding the pilgrim" are familiar sentimental tropes that limit the story's ingenuity.</comment>
