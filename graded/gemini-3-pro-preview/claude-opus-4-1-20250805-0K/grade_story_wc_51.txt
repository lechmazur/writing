<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and the pivot regarding her father’s view of light effectively anchors the Conceptual Repricing of her trap. The realization that she collects burdens creates a distinct, tragic agency that fits the accumulative mode well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds; the progression from the grandmother’s specific weight to the grotto’s collective mass builds satisfying pressure. The "warming" burner offers a resonant, magical closing image that physicalizes the memory, validating the final stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "bronze grotto" is excellent, integrating acoustics ("shingled hush") with the magic system to physically constrain Mara’s orientation. The specificity of "17 grams" grounds the metaphysical concept in a tactile, high-cost reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is internal and textural, moving from personal grief to the weight of the environment itself. The ending earns its stasis; the cost of "knowing" is felt through the physical burden of the burner, though the conflict remains quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse memory creates a strong thematic backbone about revealing vs. pushing back darkness. However, the final sentence explicitly states the thesis ("some prisons we weave ourselves") rather than trusting the image to carry the resonance, triggering a Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, handling abstract fractal concepts with sensory precision. The transition into backstory is smooth, and the perspective remains tightly anchored in Mara's sensory experience of weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high, with strong sensory verbs ("exhaled," "calcified") and consistent rhythm. "Boundary-lessly" is jarringly ungrammatical, though accepted here as a prompt constraint; otherwise, the prose supports the meditative tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractal mathematics, acoustic resonance, and the physical weight of grief offers a fresh, specific magic system. The "whalebone" metaphor creates a memorable visual distinct from standard "weaving" tropes.</comment>
