<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s internal conflict—the pull to migrate versus the duty to stay—is rendered with palpable weight. Her physical limitation (moon-phase weakness) creates immediate, embodied struggle that forces reliance on the tool, grounding her "patchwork" nature in action rather than just backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from general duty to a specific, high-stakes personal intervention (the brother). Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis; the final image of the scarred bronze foot effectively reconfigures her resignation into active purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot acts as a superb micro-setting element, functioning as a tool, an anchor, and a symbol that constrains the physical action of cranking the array. The atmosphere of the "poisoned corridor" is established through concrete, tactical details like the salt and satellite shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate naturally from strangers to a child to the protagonist's brother, tightening the emotional screw while the physical task (cranking the array) becomes harder. The cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the heavy knowledge that she is guiding loved ones toward a "geography of loss."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "reverse migration"—a fatalistic return to dying roots—is compelling and well-integrated. While phrases like "geography of loss" lean slightly toward explicit telling, the ending image of building bridges with words successfully anchors the theme in the central action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic lyricism that suits the mythic/dystopian tone. The shift from technical instruction ("Seven degrees north") to intimate reassurance ("Little one, listen") demonstrates good range and control within the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("scraped against concrete"), though occasional phrasings like "vast indifference that had swallowed whole cities" and "terrible longing" feel slightly generic compared to the sharper, more specific imagery of the salt and sulfur fields.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a reverse migration to a poisoned home is a fresh inversion of standard tropes, giving the story a distinct emotional texture. The "patchwork" element, while a bit prompt-heavy, is integrated well into the physical logic of the character.</comment>
