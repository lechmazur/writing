<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cassia’s motivation is clear and her background as a revolutionary effectively colors her archaeological perspective. However, her internal emotional landscape relies on stock phrasing ("familiar fire," "unshed tears"), and her competence feels slightly unearned as the solution comes too easily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal path with a legible closure (Charged Poise). The resolution relies on a somewhat convenient "magical" interaction between the shard and the temporal streams that dissolves the obstacle too quickly, lowering the sense of earned difficulty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting of the baroque asteroid with visible timestreams is vivid and functions well to frame the conflict. The specific detail of the covered mirrors effectively grounds the metaphysical argument in the physical environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the stakes are high (saving a civilization), the interpersonal conflict is low-friction; Director Huang capitulates after a single demonstration with minimal resistance. The victory feels smooth rather than forged through pressure or significant cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of redeeming defeat is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Cassia understood that some defeats were simply preparations...") rather than letting the dramatic action carry the resonance. This explanatory ending limits the thematic impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a poet-protagonist, but occasionally veers into melodrama. The perspective stays firmly with Cassia, filtering the world through her revolutionary past effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by a density of clichés and stock imagery ("frozen tears," "edges singing," "unshed tears," "familiar fire," "beautiful and terrible"). These artifacts dull the emotional sharpness of the line-level work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque aesthetic with visible time physics is fresh and engaging. However, the "trapped souls in crystal" trope is familiar, and the execution follows a standard "skeptic vs. believer" template.</comment>
