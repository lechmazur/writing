<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marina's interiority regarding the "hollow" memory of her daughter is compelling and grounded. However, the epiphany regarding the city founders' specific surgical history feels like an unearned knowledge leap; she deduces complex societal backstory instantly from a single visual cue, turning interiority into exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief is reclaimed—is poignant and earned by the protagonist's choice. The score is limited by the expository "download" in the climax, where the mystery is solved by a sudden intuition about the founders rather than a causal on-page discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; details like ashes drifting "upward like snow" and the specific behavior of the gravity pockets ground the magical elements. The physical environment actively constrains movement and guides the investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, balancing the city-wide crisis with the intimate loss of a child. The final choice to keep only one memory and rebury the rest creates a nuanced "Earned Stasis" with a visible emotional cost: the return of grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a physical weight affecting gravity is executed with consistency and resonance. The connection between the whale's beaching and accumulated sorrow lands effectively without feeling overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person voice is consistent and lyrical, matching the atmospheric tone of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Marina, though the narrative distance slips slightly during the expository realization about the founders.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the phrase "gleaming silence" appears three times (twice in adjacent closing paragraphs), creating a distracting lexical loop. Additionally, "crystalline clarity" is a cliché that weakens the pivotal moment of realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating city, gravity-distorting salt crystals, and a grief-magnet whale offers a fresh and specific reimagining of memory tropes. The "burial of memory in salt" is a distinct and memorable concept.</comment>
