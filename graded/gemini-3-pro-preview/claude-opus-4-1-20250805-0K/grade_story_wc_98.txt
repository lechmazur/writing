<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira is a functional protagonist whose agency drives the resolution via the ledger and seed. While her intellectual epiphany is earned and shapes the outcome, her emotional stakes ("heavier than grief") are stated more than embodied, keeping the internal conflict slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational arc, resolving with a Conceptual Repricing where the definition of reality is adjusted to save the island. The "Quantum Folklore" pivot creates a satisfying logical turn, though the resolution meets little resistance beyond the ticking clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, with the ghost orchids serving as a functional micro-setting that mirrors the theme of ephemeral reality. While the atmosphere is strong, specific cultural details (starlight tea, whale-bone harps) lean toward generic fantasy tropes rather than unique, gritty particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (cultural erasure) and the monsoon provides effective time pressure. The deepening of understanding—from viewing contradiction as a flaw to a feature—is a strong internal escalation, though the external threat remains distant (the Council) rather than immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "Quantum Folklore" concept integrates theme well into the mechanics of the story. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("After all, what could be more real..."), summarizing the thesis in a way that reduces the subtextual resonance and triggers the penalty for sermonizing endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyrical quality ("translucent as forgotten names") that fits the fable mode. The juxtaposition of this lyricism with the bureaucratic terminology of the "Council of Empirical Facades" is a purposeful choice that effectively highlights the central conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and some striking imagery ("laughter recorded on seismographs"). It occasionally drifts into "purple" adjective-heavy description, and the final sentence serves as a rhetorical scaffold that slows the momentum of the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a bureaucrat reality-checking fantasy islands is engaging and fresh. The specific synthesis of "Quantum Folklore" transforms the standard "dying magic" trope into a clever epistemological puzzle, demonstrating strong ingenuity.</comment>
