<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mara is defined clearly by longing, but her internal arc feels static; the "purification" of intention is asserted as backstory rather than dramatized as an on-page struggle. The resolution—Thomas returning because she asks correctly—undercuts her agency and creates a wish-fulfillment dynamic devoid of difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: she climbs, she asks, he returns. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost"; Thomas returning "not fully human" is framed as a victory rather than a price paid, making the ending feel unearned and the causality soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "cobalt lighthouse" and the "bruise healing into gold" provide strong, specific grounding. Sensory details like the cool stone and the scent of jasmine effectively anchor the ethereal elements, though the setting exerts little physical pressure on the plot's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the antagonist is Thomas's internal guilt, which dissolves immediately upon Mara's reassurance. There is no escalation of stakes or meaningful reversal; the outcome feels inevitable from the moment the vial is opened, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of love transcending death is present but handled with heavy-handed sentimentality ("manifest memory into molecules"). The text tells the reader how to feel about the connection rather than allowing subtext to carry the weight, resulting in a melodramatic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally slips into purple prose ("screaming tenderness" as a narrator tag). The POV remains stable with Mara, though the emotional register stays at a single high pitch without modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose has moments of beauty ("bruise healing into gold") but suffers from overwriting ("vibrations of intent," "gentle violence"). These dense, abstract phrases sometimes clutter the emotional clarity rather than sharpening it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse keeper engaging in a romance with a ghost is a familiar trope. While the specific mechanic of the scent is a nice touch, the execution follows standard genre beats without subverting them or offering a fresh structural angle.</comment>
