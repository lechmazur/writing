<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marlow is atmospherically rendered but functionally passive; he witnesses the plot rather than driving it. The ghost explains the timing ("You're early"), explains the stakes ("debt grows heavier"), and executes the resolution ("She reached for the bead"), leaving the protagonist with no decisive micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure is coherent, but the climax relies on a time-locked external trigger ("Every hundred years") rather than protagonist action. The logic contradicts itself: the ghost claims the debt was "his—to let me go," yet she is the one who physically breaks the bead to resolve it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of the alchemical greenhouse; the setting constraints (mercury, starless sky) effectively pressure the mood and tactics. The transformation of the setting at the end (magical fruit to mortal apples) carries the thematic weight of the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (eternal winter vs. mortality), but the lack of protagonist agency flatlines the conflict. Marlow endures the visitation rather than wrestling with a difficult choice; the resolution happens to him via the ghost's intervention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of accepting mortality ("sweet and mortal" fruit) lands with strong resonance. The ending image successfully reweights the premise, trading the "poisonous" magic for a liberated, ordinary dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately gothic, maintaining a consistent lyrical texture. The narrative distance is well-controlled, enhancing the fairy-tale atmosphere without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("swallowed this corner of the world"). Minor deductions for the repetitive use of prompt phrases like "mournful elation" and "winter-cracked fields" as verbatim refrains, which feels slightly looped rather than rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of the ghost-bride trope with specific alchemical imagery. The concept of "roots drinking from pools of liquid mercury" adds a unique textural layer to the standard gothic romance frame.</comment>
