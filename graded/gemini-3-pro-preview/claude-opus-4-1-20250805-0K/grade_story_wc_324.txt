<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on essayistic self-definition ("detective of the departed") rather than embodied emotional struggle. The epiphany regarding "incidental heroism" feels author-inserted to satisfy a prompt rather than a natural psychological output of the pressure she faces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ending violates causality by asserting a total resolution ("seventeen hearts remembered") while the protagonist is merely running toward the antagonist, skipping the actual confrontation or mechanism of rescue. This "mission accomplished" summary disconnects the outcome from the on-page action, failing the requirement for a dramatized closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details like the "copper taste" of interference and the "amber fragments" of light grounding the fantasy. The setting actively supports the tracking mechanics, though the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("cathedral of suspended gold").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fading photograph successfully creates a ticking clock, but the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The climax consists of a realization followed by movement, lacking a decision with a visible cost or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit reflection ("heroism was incidental") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This stated moral contradicts the protagonist's behavior, as her intentional, detective-like pursuit of the source undermines the concept of "incidental" action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the urban fantasy tone well. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism that feels performative rather than strictly filtered through the character's immediate perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the imagery is vivid, the prose suffers from strained metaphors; the opening simile ("breath through broken teeth") is visually confusing for mist in a glass atrium. Phrasing like "virus of forgetting" and "reeling hush" leans on cliché rather than fresh, concrete observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for grief" using analog tech is imaginative and engaging. However, the execution resolves into a standard "defeat the energy vampire" trope without a fresh twist or subversion, and the summarized ending diminishes the concept's impact.</comment>
