<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira functions as a vessel for the concept rather than a conflicted agent; her "burden" is stated in exposition ("Legacy's burden, her mother had called it") but never tested by a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. She accepts her role without struggle, resulting in a character who performs the plot rather than driving it through specific, costly agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (enter, find, listen, write, leave) with high clarity but low causality; events happen *to* Mira rather than because of difficult decisions. The closure relies on a "tidy" summation in the notebook rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the status quo with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is consistent, blending the academic with the wild, though the "molecular structure" explanation clashes slightly with the mystical tone of "dreaming" walls. While vivid, the setting remains largely backdrop; the ivy and ruin do not actively constrain Mira's tactics or force trade-offs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>External and internal pressure are virtually absent; Mira navigates the ruins without physical danger, time constraints, or emotional resistance. The "burden" implies weight, but on the page, she encounters only open doors and helpful clues, lacking the friction required to earn the ending's emotional claim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is resolved through explicit assertion rather than dramatized experience; the final notebook entry ("The walls dream of us because we taught them...") acts as a sermonizing summary that flattens ambiguity. This relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the character explains the story's meaning to the reader, triggering a penalty for lack of subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is smooth and controls the "archivist" tone well, though it occasionally drifts into sentimental elevation ("patient as stone, faithful as ivy"). The perspective is stable, but the lack of distinct perceptual bias—beyond the magical hearing—makes the narration feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies on stock imagery ("brittle as autumn leaves") and familiar sentimental phrasing ("whispered," "ghosts," "memories"). The rhythm is steady but lacks the sentence-level propulsion or fresh textural density expected at the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise combines the "Stone Tape Theory" (walls recording sound) with the "nature-reclaimed apocalypse" trope (e.g., *The Last of Us*), resulting in a competent but familiar synthesis. The execution is safe, avoiding the risks or specific, weird nuances that would make the concept feel fresh.</comment>
