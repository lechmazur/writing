<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus creates a cohesive internal arc, moving from skepticism to witnessing with earned interiority. The motivation to "appraise" truth rather than collect trophies is well-dramatized in the final choice to leave the wheel, showing a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on the synchronicity of the radio confession matching the exact moment of discovery, which strains causality even for a ghost story. However, the closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is vivid and purposeful ("sweating brick walls," "dust that hadn't stirred"), effectively grounding the ghost elements in industrial reality. The setting actively pressures the protagonist's mood and pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure, but the escalation of the radio voices successfully builds accumulating tension. The final renunciation provides a satisfying, if quiet, resolution to the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of the "ghost shift" as a metaphor for unseen labor and unabsolved guilt resonates deeply. The distinction between absolution and witnessing at the end offers a nuanced, non-moralizing thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, blending technical observation with lyrical reflection. Occasionally, the tone slips into slightly over-poetic registers ("frequencies only the desperate could hear"), but the POV remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though some metaphors feel slightly worn or heavy-handed ("metal tombstones," "DNA strands"). The integration of the radio dialogue is handled smoothly without disrupting the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of talk-radio psychics with industrial exploration offers a fresh, specific angle on the ghost story genre. The specific mechanism of the bead-wrapped valve wheel grounds the supernatural in tangible history.</comment>
