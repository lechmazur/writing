<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera is a competent, distinct focalizer whose specific actions (the chemical timer) demonstrate agency beyond mere observation. The "purposefully curious" trait is well-dramatized through her choice to stay, though her internal monologue regarding "budget committees" relies on standard "scientist vs. bureaucrat" tropes that feel less fresh than her technical actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly structured around the situational pressure of the evacuation deadline and the fleeting ice phenomenon. The chemical timer provides a strong causal mechanism for the climax, and the closure—exchanging the Earth grain for the lunar image—lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the site with clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "gray-white regolith" and the sublimating ice are vivid and grounded in the specific physics of the setting. The props (tarnished brass hourglass, Hasselblad) effectively anchor the 1979 timeframe, though the description of Earth as "pregnant and blue" leans on a familiar cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The conflict is effectively situational, pitting Vera against the entropy of the "dawning hush" and the evacuation clock. While there is no interpersonal conflict, the stakes of preserving a fleeting moment before humanity's retreat are felt and escalate cleanly through the chemical countdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of retreat versus persistence is well-supported by the hourglass imagery, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("when humanity remembered its courage"). This direct statement of the thesis in the final paragraphs flattens the subtextual resonance of the grain exchange.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the "last inspector" persona. The POV remains tightly controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts into slightly purple phrasing ("star-pierced void") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on some decorative abstract noun phrases ("dawnlit melancholy") and stock metaphors ("ghost's breath") in key moments. The technical description of the silver nitrate process is a high point, offering density and specificity that contrasts with the softer descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The alternative history setting of a 1979 lunar retreat offers a fresh melancholic angle on the space age. The synthesis of the ancient hourglass grain with the futuristic (for the time) chemical photography creates a unique conceptual pairing, even if the underlying "accountants vs. dreamers" dynamic is familiar.</comment>
