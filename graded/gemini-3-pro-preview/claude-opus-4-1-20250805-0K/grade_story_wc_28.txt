<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sarai’s internal struggle between restoration and transformation is well-delineated, and her backstory of "aberrant mercy" provides strong motivation. However, her primary conflict is resolved partly by external validation (the stones explicitly naming/accepting her) rather than a purely internal realization, which slightly diminishes her agency at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Situational arc, moving from a loop of guilt to a moment of release. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from restorer to creator). The reliance on the magic system to literally spell out the protagonist's identity ("Gentle Radical") acts as a convenient shortcut for the turning point, softening the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "shattered sky" and the "crimson tessera" grounding the scene effectively. The environment feels tactile and actively constrains the protagonist's loop, serving as more than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the antagonist (Brotherhood of Ash) remains an abstract background threat rather than a source of immediate scene pressure. The resolution comes relatively easily once the stones signal their acceptance, reducing the sense of risk or sacrifice required to reach the conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of mercy and transformation is coherent, but the subtext is undercut by the literal manifestation of the theme in the stones ("spelled out... Gentle Radical"). This heavy-handed labeling functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the thesis explicitly rather than letting it emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and evocative, fitting the mythic tone. However, the repeated use of the clinical term "retrocognitive" creates a register clash against the ancient, magical atmosphere, briefly disrupting the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery. However, the phrasing "warm coldness" and "cold warmth" feels repetitive and oxymoronic without adding depth. The ending leans into slightly purple abstraction ("cradling empathy in arms of steel") that feels less grounded than the earlier descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with a post-catastrophe restoration narrative is effective. While the "magic reveals true self" trope is familiar, the specific focus on "aberrant mercy" as a crime adds a fresh moral dimension to the backstory.</comment>
