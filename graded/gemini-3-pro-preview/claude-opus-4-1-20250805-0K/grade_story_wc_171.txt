<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling protagonist whose specific backstory—transforming grief into "operative gentleness"—distinctly shapes her tactical choice to break protocol. Her interiority is grounded in the concrete loss of her brother, and the transition from violence to patience feels earned and specific rather than generic. The choice to reveal failures rather than grievances acts as a strong, character-driven engine for the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and effective, utilizing the memory-glass clipboard to physically manifest the shift from stalemate to connection. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the light changing from red to "something in between" creates a tangible, earned resolution without over-promising total peace. The breakthrough is causally linked to Mara's risky deviation from tradition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional, with the twin suns' alignment mirroring the negotiation's balance and the alien physiology (crystalline vs. dark-bodied) adding specific texture to the scene. The memory-glass clipboard serves as an excellent micro-setting that constrains focus and charges the final image. The environment actively pressures the characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict is sharp and immediate, pitting Mara not just against the enemy but against the inertia of history and ritual. The Theren delegate's challenge ("abandon justice?") raises the stakes effectively, forcing Mara to articulate the thematic core. The escalation from ritual silence to verbal confrontation to physical connection feels organic and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of redemption requiring the admission of shared monstrosity is handled with nuance, avoiding simplistic moralizing. The ending resonates powerfully by acknowledging the "flawed" nature of the peace—"not yet gold"—which feels emotionally honest and thematically mature. The subtext of the "grandmother's mark" adds a layer of personal grief to the political abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a high-stakes, slightly mythic tone that suits the sci-fi diplomatic context. The shift in focus from Mara to the collective reaction of the delegates is managed smoothly. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Mara's specific brand of weary wisdom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is generally excellent, with standout phrases like "operatively gentle" and "constellation of almost-peace." The opening line ("absorbed centuries of tears") leans slightly into melodrama, but the writing quickly tightens into precise, evocative imagery. Information density is high, and the rhythm supports the solemnity of the ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (peace talks, ancient enemies) into something fresh through the specific mechanic of the memory-glass and the focus on shared guilt. The "clipboard" as a central artifact of deep lore is a clever inversion of expectations. The emotional logic feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
