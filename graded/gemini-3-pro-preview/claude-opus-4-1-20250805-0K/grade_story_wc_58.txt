<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara observes with distinct interiority, but her role remains largely passive; her motivation is stated ("learning the geography") rather than dramatized through high-pressure choices or resistance. The character functions more as a camera than an agent of change, limiting the depth of the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively builds a mood of resignation, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly. However, the orientation and movement rely heavily on internal monologue rather than dramatized interaction, creating a slightly static narrative shape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with rich sensory details ("crimson weft," "incense smoke") firmly grounding the abstract concept. The "shadowed garden" serves as an effective, moody container for the projection mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Escalation is internal and subtle; while the density of observation increases, the stakes remain static (observation/acceptance) without forcing a difficult trade-off or active decision. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening of the screw to force the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept of "explained absences" is poignant, but the ending articulates the theme ("healing was not a destination but a map") in a direct summary. This explicit moralizing in the final paragraph triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, flattening the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately elevated for the lyric mode. The transition between physical presence and projection is handled smoothly without confusing the reader's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is evocative but repetitive with key terms ("absence," "presence") and relies too often on filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "realized"). The phrase "lonesome splendor" appears twice, feeling forced as a refrain in such a short space.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living using a magical carpet thread is a fresh, specific synthesis of fantasy elements. The execution leans on familiar tropes of the "dying city," but the central hook provides a unique angle.</comment>
