<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moth is a distinct focalizer with a clear role, but her pivot from preserver (17 years of perfection) to destroyer feels slightly retroactive ("She understood now why she had been cryptic"). The internal conflict is resolved somewhat conveniently by destiny rather than an agonized choice between two active values, though the cost is high.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fable logic holds together well, with the "Great Softening" providing a sturdy frame for the surreal causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the destruction of the library; the cost is absolute, and the transformation of the protagonist into text completes the narrative arc effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the glass trees and frost patterns are not just backdrop but the mechanism of resolution. The environment pressures the character (the trembling shelves, the shedding pages) and provides the tools for the climax, meeting the high-band criteria for integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high—the destruction of the protagonist's world—and the escalation is clear as the bottle destabilizes the environment. However, the conflict is largely internal and abstract; the antagonist is an object/concept, which makes the tension intellectual rather than visceral until the library begins to physically collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The thematic work is coherent, but the final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("rupture can be revelation") rather than letting the image speak for itself. This explanatory coda deflates the resonance of the final image, trading ambiguity for a sermonizing summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable quality that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though there are moments of slight over-explanation ("of course") that distance the reader from Moth's immediate experience during the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("sun painted frost patterns"). While some phrases lean towards the purple ("origami made of time"), the rhythm is strong and the line-level mechanics support the dreamlike atmosphere without confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a magical library is a familiar trope, but the specific mechanics of the frost-printing and the "Great Softening" add a fresh layer. The execution elevates the premise, though the ending leans on a familiar meta-fictional turn (the character becoming the story).</comment>
