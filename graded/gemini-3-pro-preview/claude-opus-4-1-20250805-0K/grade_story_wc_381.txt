<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's ethical stance—sacrificing positive futures ("loves that would never bloom") to ensure peace—creates a compelling, complex worldview. Her solitude is effectively drawn, though the "decades of communion" feels slightly more told than shown through specific, idiosyncratic behaviors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving cleanly from the inciting ritual to a resonant closure. The "Earned Stasis" ending, where the prophecy is dissolved rather than fulfilled, lands with clear conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting actively participates in the resolution, with the brook serving as a necessary tool. However, descriptors like "terrestrially cosmic twin" feel overwritten, and the atmosphere wavers between mythic and modern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high and clearly defined; the resistance of the "living" prophecy creates tangible pressure. The cost—the loss of beneficial futures to maintain stability—is a strong, felt price paid for the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of censorship as a form of mercy is well-articulated. The subversion of the self-fulfilling prophecy trope resonates strongly with the final image of the crumbling wing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Significant register drift disrupts the fantasy immersion. Terms like "collective unconscious," "white noise," and "potential energy" belong to modern psychology and physics, clashing sharply with the established tone of "moth-thoughts" and "moonlight."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While imagery is often vivid ("invisible fruit"), the prose suffers from the register slips noted above and occasional heavy-handedness ("trillion smaller possibilities"). These anachronisms break the spell of the otherwise lyrical style.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central mechanism—silencing a prophecy by diluting it in running water—is an inventive and fresh subversion of standard fantasy tropes. The "origami wing of crystallized moonlight" is a memorable, creative object.</comment>
