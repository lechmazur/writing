<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, grounded focalizer whose transition from survivalist to custodian of memory is well-motivated by the specific discoveries in the box. The internal conflict between the bitterness of the abandonment and the love for her grandfather is resolved through the acceptance of the "tangled promises," creating a strong emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative drive works well, moving from the appearance of the ghosts to the opening of the box and the final realization. The closure (Earned Stasis) is distinct and resonant, with the protagonist accepting a conceptual cost (the weight of silence) that reconfigures her existence. A slight reliance on intuition before evidence in the middle beat prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "bleached" hives and "scorched" oasis creating a tangible sense of desolation. The sensory details of the stained glass box—its warmth and the light it catches—effectively contrast with the harsh environment, grounding the supernatural elements in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily thematic and emotional, centering on the preservation of history versus the consumption of the desert. The pressure is subtle but coherent, escalating as the dawn threatens to erase the ghosts, forcing Mara to engage with the box to capture their message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "unspoken words" and "tangled promises" is beautifully woven into the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image. The connection between the environmental collapse and the community's communication failure adds depth without becoming overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, melancholic, and precise, suiting the "mute eloquence" tone required. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Mara's perceptions while allowing for the necessary exposition about the past.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like "broken teeth" and "captured sunset." There is a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing ("luminous weight"), and the required phrase "contextual clues" feels a touch academic against the poetic backdrop, but the overall rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "beekeeper of ghosts" in a post-apocalyptic setting is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. The focus on the "covenant" as a physical and metaphorical object adds a layer of ingenuity that elevates the standard "last survivor" narrative.</comment>
