<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara serves as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a fully realized character. Her motivation ("haunted nightly") is stated in exposition but lacks dramatized emotional weight or internal contradiction. She faces no difficult choices and succeeds without struggle, leaving her arc flat and devoid of the required character-specific cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, lock-and-key structure where obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient magical tools. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect solution with no lingering tension or price paid—failing the requirement for closure with felt or conceptual cost. The causality is smooth but lacks the friction of a genuine narrative argument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative, blending the whale carcass with the salt chamber effectively, but the environment functions largely as a static backdrop. While the descriptions are vivid, the "fluctuating gravity" is atmospheric rather than a physical constraint that forces the protagonist to adapt her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure. The protagonist moves from desire to fulfillment without encountering resistance, turning the story into a procedural ritual rather than a dramatic struggle. The "pockets of gravity" are described as a force but never act as a genuine obstacle to her goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and heavy-handed exposition ("Mara understood then that deleted memories were not lost..."). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge through subtext or ambiguity, resulting in a didactic tone that flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is cohesive but leans into a saccharine fairytale register that softens the impact of the potentially darker "rotting scar" imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("sand fell away like sifted dreams," "tide's breath hardened") that obscure physical reality. The reliance on abstract similes and high-concept phrasing halts momentum, prioritizing decorative lyricism over clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the prompt elements—specifically the salt chamber within a whale scar—is creative and visually distinct. However, the narrative execution falls into a safe "healing/fixing" trope common in prompt-based fiction, lacking the risk-taking or subversive edge required for a higher score.</comment>
