<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract labels ("reticent," "warmly observant") and diagnostic emotion ("surge of purpose") rather than embodied behavior. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Marek performs a ritual without hesitation or psychic cost, resulting in a flat, purely functional protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc relies on a magical "soft reset" (stones glowing) to solve the inciting incident (lamp dying), stripping the climax of causality and cost. The closure is a symmetric satisfaction that erases the stakes rather than forcing the protagonist to navigate a changed reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Setting details are generic lighthouse tropes ("iron ribs," "broken panes") that fail to constrain action. The shift from "haunted" to "sanctuary" is asserted through adjectives rather than earned through a change in sensory interaction or physical limitations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the dying lamp presents a problem that is immediately solved by a magical ritual without opposition or trade-off. There is no escalation of pressure, only a linear progression toward a guaranteed, cost-free success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Subtext is suffocated by explicit moralizing, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the lesson ("collective memory of those who dared to care"). The theme is delivered as a sermon rather than emerging organically from the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly interpretive, frequently telling the reader how to interpret images ("trapped sunrise," "silent punctuation") instead of allowing the details to land. This "helpful narrator" syndrome distances the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Prose is laden with "purple" abstractions ("luminescent ache," "trapped sunrise") and relies heavily on weak adverb-adjective pairings ("warmly observant," "cold, uneasy silence"). The "dared to care" rhyme in the final beat undermines the intended gravity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise of a magical solution to a mechanical failure in a lighthouse is a familiar sentimental trope. The execution offers no fresh subversion or grit, relying on the "cozy" safety of the bottle metaphor without exploring the danger of the dark.</comment>
