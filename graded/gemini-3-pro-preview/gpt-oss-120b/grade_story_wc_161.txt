<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract labels ("storm of loss") rather than embodied emotion or specific interiority. Lila lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, acting as a functional vehicle for the magical concept without making high-stakes choices that reveal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a summary of "weeks" rather than a dramatized scene with causal progression. There is no distinct inciting incident or structural tightening; the resolution ("attic filled with a soft chorus") arrives through procedural description rather than earned struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The setting relies on "vintage" tropes ("yellowed maps," "dust motes") that create a generic atmospheric backdrop without constraining the character's choices. Specificity is ornamental rather than functional to the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Stakes are purely abstract ("echo of lost songs") with no concrete obstacles or opposition. Success is immediate and linear; there is no escalation of pressure, and the "fragile trust" mentioned is never tested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("She realized that reinvention does not erase...") rather than subtext or action. The resolution is sentimental and tidy, offering a simple "healing" narrative without complexity or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly distant and reliant on poetic abstraction ("withering grace," "celestial lullaby"). The psychic distance prevents immediate engagement with the character's sensory reality or urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose is heavy with abstract telling ("She believed that preserving...") and cliché adjective-noun pairings ("luminous whirl"). Frequent use of filter verbs ("Lila knew," "She realized") distances the reader from the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the mechanic of mapping dust motes is inventive, the story's execution follows a generic "magical healing" template. The lack of risk-taking or formal innovation leaves the piece feeling like a response to a prompt rather than a unique vision.</comment>
