<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype with no interiority, contradiction, or on-page micro-choices; his motivation is explicitly stated ("simple yet fierce") rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a summary of a routine ("Every morning") rather than a dramatized scene with a specific inciting incident; the lack of a singular event prevents meaningful closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Imagery of the "iceberg fragment" and "copper arm" is vivid, but the lack of a specific temporal anchor ("Every morning") prevents grounded spatial choreography or immediate sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict or opposition; the wind "bows," the neighbors understand, and the gulls fall silent, leaving the protagonist with no obstacles to overcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("Thus hope glistens") and abstract assertions ("symphonies of truth") rather than emerging organically from narrative action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone but relies heavily on distancing filter verbs ("He has learned," "He knows") and passive observation rather than immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Significant repetition of keywords ("glisten," "wonder," "truth") creates a "template cadence"; a subject-verb agreement error ("arm that glisten") and abstract noun overuse reduce clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story relies on a standard "artist preserving beauty" trope without a fresh twist or specific synthesis; the execution feels generic and lacks risk-taking or unique insight.</comment>
