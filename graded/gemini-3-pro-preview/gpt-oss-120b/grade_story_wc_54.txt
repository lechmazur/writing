<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a cipher for the theme rather than a living character; she encounters no internal conflict, makes no difficult trade-offs, and experiences emotions only through diagnostic labels ("stoic wonder"). Her success is immediate and unearned by struggle or specific capability, lacking the "competence balanced with genuine struggle" required for agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path of unobstructed success with no causal friction; the protagonist intends to fix the terminal and simply does so without setback. The mechanism of resolution (using a sextant to route voltage) relies on dream logic rather than established story rules, and the ending lacks a legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details ("dust," "cracked control panel") provide a visual texture, but the setting functions more as a metaphorical construct than a physical space. The interaction between tools and the environment (aligning a sextant to control electricity) breaks physical verisimilitude without establishing a magical realism frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>There are no stakes or opposition; the terminal yields to the intern’s efforts immediately. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal, resulting in a procedural description of success rather than a dramatic arc with risk or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("equations... for the very sentiment") rather than subtext or action. The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the prose summarizes the moral ("infinite nature of engineering and hope") instead of allowing it to emerge from the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly elevated and abstract, creating distance rather than immersion. The reliance on high-register metaphorical phrasing ("vector of unfinished plans") dominates the narration, flattening the distinctness of the character's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from heavy "genitive metaphor" overload ("maze of intentions," "lattice of intention pathways," "framework of possibility"), which obscures concrete action. These artifacts reduce clarity and momentum, replacing sensory grounding with abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The concept of "engineering hope" is treated as a generic trope without specific, lived detail or genuine complication. The story synthesizes familiar elements of post-apocalyptic reclamation but resolves them with a "magic wand" convenience that lacks ingenuity.</comment>
