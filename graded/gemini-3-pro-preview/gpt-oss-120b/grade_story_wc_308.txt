<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by prompt labels ("historically reverent," "harmonic stone skimmer") rather than embodied behavior or internal conflict. Her interiority is summarized through abstract nouns ("weathered resolve") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. The character functions as a passive vessel for the ritual rather than an agent of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The structure is linear and lacks a distinct turning point or moment of pressure; the protagonist desires a skill and acquires it without complication or setback. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (navigating the mind instead of the canyon), it arrives without a felt cost or a prior foreclosure of options, reading more like a completed tutorial than a narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospherically described with vivid imagery ("towers of bone," "endless echoes"), establishing a strong mythic mood. However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of physical constraint or obstacle that forces specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a dominant stake or active opposition; the protagonist faces no risk of failure and pays no visible price for her success. The narrative escalates only in descriptive density, not in pressure or consequence, resulting in a flat trajectory where the goal is achieved through simple observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of stillness and continuity is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed repetition of keywords ("pulse," "echo") rather than emergent subtext. The insights feel asserted by the narrator ("even stillness moves through time") rather than earned through the character's specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that suits the subject matter. However, the high psychic distance prevents emotional intimacy, and the voice occasionally slips into "telling" the reader how to interpret the moment rather than allowing the action to speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from lexical repetition ("pulse," "echo," "canyon") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("weathered resolve" appears twice as a label). The reliance on adjective-heavy description ("skeletal spires," "ancient ribs," "thin air") slows momentum and creates a dense, somewhat purple texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the concept of acoustic navigation is interesting, the execution relies on standard fantasy tropes and a literal, additive approach to the prompt elements. The interpretation of "stone skimmer" is passive, missing the kinetic potential of the title, and the story takes few risks with structure or perspective.</comment>
