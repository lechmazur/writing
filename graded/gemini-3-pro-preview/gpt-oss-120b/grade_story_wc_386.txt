<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a functional archetype defined by a singular purpose without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or distinct personality traits. Emotional states are described via abstract labels ("grief," "purity") rather than embodied experience, and the character faces no difficult choices that test her values or competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative reads as a procedural summary of a magic system rather than a dramatized scene; events unfold linearly without causal resistance or necessity. The closure is a task completion ("pulsed brighter") that lacks the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; success is inevitable and unearned by struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and lyrical ("trembling silver," "liquid mirror") but function primarily as atmospheric decoration rather than constraining choice. The setting is established clearly, but the "glacier ice" and "shrine" do not exert pressure or force tactical adjustments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The story lacks an active antagonist, obstacle, or ticking clock; the protagonist executes a plan without meaningful opposition or risk of failure. Escalation is purely atmospheric ("veil thicken") rather than causal, and the stakes remain abstract concepts ("hidden purity") that never face a concrete threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the narration ("truth... could expose the hidden beauty") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The resolution offers a tidy, sentimental moral that resolves complex grief into simple "purity" without earning the insight through dramatic action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies heavily on explanatory telling and filter verbs ("she knew," "she recognized," "she realized") which creates distance and reduces immediacy. The psychic distance is static, summarizing the character's understanding rather than immersing the reader in her perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("weaving... filaments through a loom of memory") that prioritize ornament over clarity. A high frequency of abstract descriptors and filter verbs clutters the sentences, slowing momentum and obscuring the physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core mechanic of analyzing "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" is imaginative, but the execution relies on high-fantasy exposition rather than grounded specificity. The story synthesizes familiar tropes of dream-walking and purification without a fresh structural or character-driven angle.</comment>
