<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara functions as a passive vessel for the magical prop rather than an agent of change; she executes a ritual without facing a difficult choice or internal contradiction. Her motivation is stated in abstract thematic terms ("living calculus") rather than grounded in immediate, felt desire or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear procedure (wait, cast spell, succeed) with no causal reversals or obstacles within the scene. The resolution relies on a "magic feather" device that dissolves bureaucratic problems off-page, violating the requirement for on-page closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like lilies and polished oak are vivid but skew toward cliché ("whispering shadows"). The setting provides atmospheric backing for the magic system but does not exert concrete pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conflict is entirely abstract and located off-page (bureaucracy in a distant country); there is no immediate antagonist or obstacle in the prep room. The tension is atmospheric ("mourners whispered") rather than causal, resulting in a low-stakes ritual where success feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Themes are articulated through heavy-handed exposition ("turning stubborn doubts into fluid possibilities") rather than subtext or action. The story lectures the reader on the meaning of the trade instead of allowing it to emerge organically from the drama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from high psychic distance and overwrought "writerly" phrasing ("seep into her marrow," "veins of gold"). The tone prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense with mixed metaphors and abstract nouns ("stone walls of prejudice," "ink's alchemy"). Phrases like "liquefy rigid thinking" are treated as literal mechanics, blurring the line between metaphor and reality in a way that obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the combination of a funeral home and political asylum is novel, the execution falls into a "magic fixes everything" template. The story lacks a fresh structural turn, relying on the inherent power of the prop to resolve the plot.</comment>
