<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara serves as a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her motivation lacks internal conflict or personal cost. The attribute "cautiously hopeful" is applied as a repeated label rather than dramatized through difficult, high-stakes decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The story dissolves into a summary montage ("She taught," "Word spread") that trivializes the resolution, violating the single-scene scope. The causality is weak, relying on a "magic bullet" technology (subsonic hum) to instantly resolve complex social and political conflicts without earned effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic adjectives ("restless static," "old university") rather than concrete, tactile details that constrain action. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the antagonist's "power plays" are abstract and easily defeated by a single action. The Dean’s opposition evaporates instantly upon hearing the signal, removing any genuine struggle or necessity for compromise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("power plays lose their edge when all ears listen as one") rather than subtext. The resolution offers a simplistic binary where unity is achieved via technological mind-nudge, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and occasionally drifts into omniscient summary, breaking the immediate POV. The tone struggles with the "ethereal grit" prompt, resulting in forced phrasing that clashes with the fable-like atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten and dense with mixed metaphors ("airwaves split like a mirror shattered"). Reliance on abstract adjectives ("celestial," "ethereal," "subsonic") creates a lack of immediacy and slows narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the premise of a radio operator intercepting cosmic signals is promising, the execution relies on the familiar "magic frequency heals society" trope. The lack of grounded consequences makes the outcome feel naive rather than earned.</comment>
