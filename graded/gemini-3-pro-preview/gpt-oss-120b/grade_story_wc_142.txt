<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") rather than dramatized behavior. Mira's "dual allegiance" is stated in exposition but never tested by a difficult on-page choice, resulting in a protagonist who functions as a plot device rather than a living person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative acts as a high-level synopsis or fable rather than a short story, summarizing weeks of action instead of dramatizing a specific scene. Crucial beats—the reorganization effort and the confrontation with investors—are glossed over in summary, stripping the narrative of immediate causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a "raft city" is evocative, the description remains at the "postcard" level ("kaleidoscope," "bright banners") without specific sensory grounding. The setting functions as a generic backdrop rather than a tactile environment that constrains the protagonist's physical movements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and lacks visceral stakes; the opposition (investors) is defeated instantly by a mural without any on-page struggle or counter-move. The resolution feels unearned because the "tightrope" Mira supposedly walks is never pulled taut in a specific moment of crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is didactic, delivering a tidy moral about community versus privatization through explicit assertions rather than subtext. The ending offers a simplified, symmetrical victory that ignores the complexity of the stated economic threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently telling the reader what to feel ("hopeful desperation") rather than evoking it through distinct perception. There is no unique "perceptual signature"; the voice reads like a standard fable summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Prose is overwritten with abstract metaphors ("living verses," "relentless wonder") and relies heavily on telling over showing. The phrase "hopeful desperation" is repeated as a shorthand for emotion that the scene fails to dramatize concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the setting offers a fresh visual, the plot follows a generic "community art saves the neighborhood" template without distinct twists. The execution lacks the specific, lived-in detail that would transform the trope into something original.</comment>
