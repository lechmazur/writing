<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific character; she lacks interiority, contradictory impulses, or defined micro-choices in a "now." Her actions are narrated as habitual summary ("each time," "she moved") rather than dramatized decisions under immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The piece fails the core requirement of a dramatized scene, functioning instead as a synopsis or legend summary spanning "lifetimes" and "countless suns." There is no grounded "now" where cause and effect play out; the closure is narrated from a distance rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is consistent but relies on abstract, "white room" descriptions ("endless night," "frost-bitten vines") without concrete spatial grounding. The setting functions as a backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space that constrains the character's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is retrospective and internal, lacking an immediate antagonist or obstacle in the present moment. The narrative lacks escalation; the resolution (fading away) happens because the summary says it is time, not because of a decisive, high-stakes choice made under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Themes are explicitly stated ("changing their alchemy from metal to memory") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on heavy-handed explanations of the moral ("debts... could be repaid through resonance") rather than resonant imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but distant and overly poetic, maintaining a "legend-telling" remove that prevents emotional intimacy. The tone is uniform throughout, lacking the modulation required to build tension or distinguish narrative beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Significant overwriting and purple prose obscure clarity ("tasted of molten hope," "sigh that tasted of roses and rust," "veil a whisper of ash"). The density of abstract metaphors and synesthesia creates a barrier to visualization and dulls the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost bride repaying a debt is a familiar trope, and the execution offers little fresh subversion or specific, lived detail to elevate it. The reliance on summary and abstract magic prevents the premise from feeling distinct or urgent.</comment>
