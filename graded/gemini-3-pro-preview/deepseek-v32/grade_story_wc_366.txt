<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is explicitly stated via exposition ("His own motivation, he realized...") rather than dramatized through conflict. The shift from a grounded skipper to a character capable of metaphysical "bottling" lacks setup, making the climax feel disconnected from his established skillset. The trait "warmly observant" appears as a repetitive label rather than a demonstrated behavior under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story suffers from a severe causality break at the climax: the resolution relies on an unearned magical act (bottling a feeling to create physical light) that contradicts the realistic grounding established earlier. The timeframe element is inserted as an awkward meta-commentary ("The timeframe was set...") rather than woven into the narrative flow. Closure is achieved through a "Deus Ex Machina" mechanics shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is distinct, utilizing the lighthouse setting effectively to create a mood of isolation. However, descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("glass-paned crown," "luminescent ache") rather than relying on sensory concrete details that constrain the character's choices. The stone-stacking detail is a highlight of specific, grounded world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The conflict is resolved with virtually no resistance; Leo decides to bottle a feeling, and it simply works immediately, removing the ghost and fixing the light. There is no cost, trade-off, or failure cycle to escalate the tension before this success. The stakes are declared but the solution is too convenient to carry weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of connection and protection is legible but heavily explicated through telling ("His action was to protect..."). The "anonymous letter chain" offers strong thematic potential, but the sentimental resolution flattens the complexity of the grief into a tidy, magical fix.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently stepping in to explain the meaning of actions or thoughts. The tone wavers between gritty maritime realism and whimsical fairy tale without a smooth bridge between the two modes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Several text artifacts mar the prose, including the repetition of prompt phrases like "warmly observant" and "luminescent ache" as static labels. Scaffolded sentences ("The method of reply was not...", "His action was to protect...") reduce density and momentum. The literal insertion of the timeframe prompt as a sentence breaks immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of the stone-stacking communication system is inventive and touching. However, the ghost story follows standard tropes, and the "bottling a feeling" resolution feels like a genre error (shifting to fable/magic realism) rather than an ingenious twist on the premise.</comment>
