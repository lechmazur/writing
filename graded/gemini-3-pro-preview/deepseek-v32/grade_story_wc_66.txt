<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris functions as a diligent archetype rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or distinct flaws. His motivation is clear, but his success feels inevitable, with no moment of doubt or difficult choice to test his resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear accumulative path where actions lead directly to success without setbacks or cost. While the dust waking is a Decisive Change, the lack of "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" prevents the closure from resonating deeply; the resolution feels magical rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strength, with the ember alcove and mist creating a vivid, consistent mood. The sensory details regarding the radio's green light and the dancing dust are specific and grounding, though the "thistled calm" descriptor is reused rather than evoked through new imagery at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>External and internal pressure are minimal; Aris faces no active antagonism, risk of discovery, or possibility of failure. The stakes remain abstract ("rebuild narrative") and are not tested by immediate danger or sacrifice, leaving the victory feeling low-stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of art as resistance is coherent and woven through the plot, but execution leans heavily on explicit statements ("The dust listens..."). The message is delivered didactically through the broadcast lyrics rather than emerging organically from subtext or struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but occasionally repetitive, relying on the prompt phrases ("thistled calm") as crutches. The tone matches the "fable" quality, though it sometimes drifts into abstract summary rather than immediate scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean but suffers from mechanical repetition of required phrases ("secretly luminous" appears three times; "thistled calm" twice). These repetitions act as text artifacts that break immersion, and filter verbs ("He understood," "He realized") occasionally distance the reader.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central image of teaching dust to form shapes via radio light is imaginative and visually distinct. However, the lack of narrative friction and the fable-like simplicity keep the concept from reaching a deeper, more complex level of engagement.</comment>
