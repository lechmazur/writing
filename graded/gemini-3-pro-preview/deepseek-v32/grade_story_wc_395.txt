<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s internal conflict is compelling, culminating in a choice with palpable weight. However, her initial "philosophical itch" and rapid descent into obsession are told rather than dramatized through progressive action, making the setup feel slightly mechanical compared to the strong, embodied resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and the closure is decisive, effectively utilizing the "lie" to resolve the immediate threat while deepening the personal cost. The middle section relies on summary ("cross-referenced everything," "unofficial tools") rather than scene to bridge the discovery and the climax, reducing the tension of the investigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "digital necropolis" is established with competent sensory details ("hummed," "cold corridors"). While functional, the setting draws on familiar cyberpunk tropes without establishing a unique or surprising specific atmosphere that constrains the protagonist's physical actions beyond the screen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and escalate logically from a technical curiosity to a threat against survival. The final choice creates a meaningful "Earned Stasis" where the protagonist preserves the truth at the cost of personal isolation, a price vividly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory and erasure is coherent and lands with emotional resonance. The final insight—that deleted files live in the keepers—is poignant, though the explicit articulation of this moral in the narrative narration ("The deleted files had a destination, she now knew") leans towards telling rather than letting the subtext breathe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone of melancholic gravity. The perspective stays firmly with Aris, though the transition into summary during the investigation creates a slight distance that dampens the immediacy of the discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and readable, with a few evocative phrases ("frozen river of thoughts"). However, reliance on phrasal clichés ("terrible truth," "eyes cold," "thin smile") and the slightly awkward insertion of the required attribute dampen the line-level freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of a memory archivist uncovering a corporate conspiracy is a well-worn trope. While the execution is competent and the internalization of the files offers a nice conceptual turn, the story follows a predictable path without significantly subverting genre expectations.</comment>
