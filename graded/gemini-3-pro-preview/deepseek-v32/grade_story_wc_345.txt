<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The collective "we" POV lacks distinct interiority or internal contradiction, relying on summarized emotions like "doubt crept in" rather than dramatized struggle. Mara functions as a prop for physical actions without agency, and the group's obedience "without question" strips the narrative of character-driven friction. The emotional arc is stated rather than embodied, failing to meet the standard for character particularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The narrative relies on "and-then" summary spanning years rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure, violating the scope default for this length. The progression is linear and resistance-free, resulting in an outline-like structure where problems are solved by instructions rather than agency. Orientation is clear, but the lack of an on-page closure unit with felt cost anchors the score low.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Imagery like the "tapestry of gnarled fruit trees" creates a pleasant atmosphere but remains generic and fails to constrain choices under pressure. The setting serves as a static backdrop for the fable rather than an active force or tool that bodies must navigate with consequence. The description is vivid but lacks the sensory hierarchy of a character under immediate stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible as the collective obeys instructions instantly, bypassing potential tension or trade-offs. The narrative lacks meaningful tightening or escalation; success is granted through compliance, and the only internal obstacle ("doubt") is resolved instantly by a message rather than earned action. There is no visible cost to the characters' choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("You are the gardeners now") and sermonizing summaries that explain the meaning rather than allowing it to resonate. This direct statement of the thesis in the final act flattens subtext and relies on "Thematic Echo" rather than organic emergence from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "we" voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive mythic tone, though it creates significant psychic distance that prevents intimate engagement. The narration tends toward the "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of events ("In that moment, we understood...") instead of trusting the dramatization to convey meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose relies on clichés ("kaleidoscope of color," "tapestry") and abstract telling, with heavy use of adjectives that reduce immediacy. The rhythm is repetitive, often following a pattern of instruction-action-result, and lacks the information density or propulsion required for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The fable-like structure and "we become the mentors" conclusion are familiar tropes executed without a fresh, risky synthesis. The story plays it safe with a linear path to a clearly stated moral, lacking the specific, lived-in detail or structural risk that would transform the premise into something urgent.</comment>
