<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's arc from jittery to steady is clear and structurally sound. However, his pivotal choice is driven by a vision that provides explicit instructions, slightly diminishing the sense of active agency in the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal path to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the courier's duty is repriced. The reliance on a convenient vision to solve the central puzzle prevents a higher score, but the cost (loss of artifact) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and specific, with details like "leadwood," "silent, green fire," and "spectral stag" grounding the fantasy. The setting actively participates in the climax, fueling the germination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The decision to destroy the delivery in favor of planting it represents a meaningful tightening of stakes with a clear cost. The pressure of the environment supports the turn effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed exposition, particularly in the final paragraph ("wonder waited, patient as a seed"). The text explains the metaphor rather than letting the imagery resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mythic tone. The perspective stays firmly with Kael, effectively filtering the world through his anxiety and eventual realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("nerve exposed to the wind"). Information density is good, though some moments lapse into summary ("They did not simply grow; they germinated") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "courier planting the package" is a nice variation on the delivery trope. The execution is competent and atmospheric, though the lesson-oriented ending feels slightly formulaic.</comment>
