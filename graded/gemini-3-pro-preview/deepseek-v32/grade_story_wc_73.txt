<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is rendered with precision; the shift from "formless regret" to holding a "beautiful, terrible truth" marks a clear, earned psychological reconfiguration. The "grim optimist" trait is not just a label but drives the persistent, calculated ascent and the final acceptance of the "documented system."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is exemplary; the "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the staircase from a "blind engine" to a "documented system" perfectly answers the narrative question with distinct conceptual cost. The logic of the "rupture" follows clearly from the established rules of the dice and the staircase's reactivity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tactile details like the "slick cold" rail, the "humming" iron, and the sound "like tearing silk" effectively ground the abstract, infinite geometry in immediate sensation. The setting acts as an antagonist that responds to the protagonist's actions, satisfying the constraint requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The escalation is driven by active agency—the decision to risk the "greater experiment"—and the cost is viscerally felt in the "crushing weight" of the returned memory. The stakes transition smoothly from intellectual curiosity to emotional survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical logic and emotional grief is profound, offering a complex resolution where regret is not erased but "proven" and integrated. The ending resonates with a "beautiful, terrible truth" that feels earned by the preceding logic rather than imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register ("lemma," "calcified," "coordinates") that perfectly mirrors the mathematician's analytical worldview without becoming dry. Distance control is precise, keeping the reader firmly within the protagonist's interpretative frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong imagery ("cage of his own design," "ghost of perpetual motion") that advances character and setting simultaneously. The pacing of the climax—the "stutter" and "suspension"—is handled with excellent rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, specific reconfiguration of the Sisyphean trope by introducing active, mathematical engagement with the punishment. The use of the dice to introduce a "self-referential flaw" is an ingenious mechanism for the climax.</comment>
