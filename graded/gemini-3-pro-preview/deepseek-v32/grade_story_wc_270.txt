<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is declared ("singular: to evolve tradition") rather than dramatized through struggle or doubt. She lacks internal contradiction, making her actions feel procedural rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible, but the "freak accident" telepathy acts as a convenient shortcut to solve the central puzzle without difficulty. Causality is soft, relying on this sudden ability rather than ingenuity or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The integration of the hot spring as a sonic instrument is excellent, grounding the fantastical method in the physical setting. The geothermal atmosphere is palpable and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the "elders" are an abstract off-stage concept rather than a present force. Marta faces no failure condition or active resistance, making the climax feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("not a predestined blueprint, but a question"), robbing the ending of resonance. Subtext is replaced by explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is stable and fable-like, though it relies on distancing summary to convey internal states. The single POV is maintained without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prose is functional but suffers from clunky exposition (the "freak childhood accident" sentence) and heavy reliance on telling. Information density is diluted by abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The combination of elements—sonic keys, geothermal instruments, and biological amber—is creative. The central concept of "destiny as a question" offers a fresh take on the reconstruction trope.</comment>
