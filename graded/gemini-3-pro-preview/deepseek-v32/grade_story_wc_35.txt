<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira’s internal landscape is well-drawn, and the cost of her action (permanently altered palate) creates a solid arc of sacrifice. The "chef" identity feels slightly metaphorical rather than practical until the climax, but the emotional logic holds. The interaction with Elara effectively establishes the stakes of the "contagious" emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean causal line to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where cost is paid on the page. The discovery of the pavilion relies on a slightly convenient "recent downpour" and dune collapse, but the resolution mechanism is tightly linked to the character's established ability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "coral icebound pavilion" in a desert is a striking, surreal image that anchors the atmosphere effectively. Sensory details are vivid ("smelled of clean salt," "biting through her boots"), utilizing the protagonist’s specific sensory focus to ground the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central conflict is clear, with the external pressure of the "stored remorse" escalating through the handshake and the pavilion's discovery. The cost is legible and felt—Mira sacrifices her own internal peace to heal the fortress—satisfying the requirement for agency with consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of the "sin-eater" reimagined through culinary synthesis is handled with resonance and avoids heavy-handed moralizing. The ending offers a meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo, balancing the relief of the fortress against the weight Mira must now carry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly mythic tone that suits the magical realism of the premise. The shift from observation to internal consumption is handled smoothly, though the "sturdy brittle" phrasing feels slightly mechanical in its insertion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, though occasionally relies on adjectival stacking ("damp, sturdy brittle silence"). Some emotional descriptions lean into "tell" territory ("faces etched with hope and fear"), but the climax is rendered with strong, active imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chef's palate with memory-work creates a fresh angle on the empathetic healer trope. The central image of frozen coral in a desert is imaginative and memorable, elevating the standard "cleansing a cursed place" plot.</comment>
