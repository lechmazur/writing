<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("sensory map maker," "synesthetic impressions") rather than embodied behavior. The protagonist's motivation is stated as a constant abstraction ("weight of a withheld truth") rather than shown through conflict or desire. The repeated use of the phrase "cyclically spontaneous" as a trait label disrupts immersion and feels mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path but relies on convenience; the protagonist finds a shard that solves the mystery via an info-dump vision. The closure—accepting the burden—is a "Decisive Change," but it feels unearned because the struggle was bypassed by the artifact's intervention. The "cyclically spontaneous" power activates exactly when the plot requires it, reducing agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The setting is established clearly with some evocative details ("scent of ozone," "decaying starship skeletons"). However, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop for the psychic vision rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The "thin place between realities" concept is told rather than demonstrated through interaction with the physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract ("weight of a withheld truth") and the conflict is resolved too easily by the green glass shard. There is no escalation of pressure; a "violent psychic current" appears and is immediately tamed. The final decision to accept responsibility lacks tension because the alternative was never seriously entertained on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("mass of consequence, the density of love"). The story tells the reader exactly what to feel rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the action. The repetition of the phrase "withheld truth" flattens the subtext into a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("cyclically spontaneous," "murmur of half-remembered dreams") that break the rhythm. The tone is overly solemn and abstract, lacking the modulation needed to make the climax feel distinct from the exposition. Distance is somewhat remote, filtering experience through heavy adjectives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Significant "template-cadence" artifacts lower the score; the phrase "cyclically spontaneous" is repeated four times, and "green glass shard" four times, creating a robotic texture. The prose leans into purple abstractions ("mental embroidery," "gravity of continuity") instead of concrete imagery. These repetitions act as scaffolding that should have been removed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a mentor sealing a rift to save worlds is a standard trope, handled here without a fresh subversion. While the "sensory map maker" concept has potential, it is treated as a job title rather than a unique lens for the narrative. The execution feels like a dutiful response to a checklist rather than an organic story.</comment>
