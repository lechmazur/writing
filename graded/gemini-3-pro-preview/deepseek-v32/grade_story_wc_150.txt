<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Leila serves primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted agent; her "warmly curious nature" is applied as a label that conveniently suppresses fear rather than dramatizing a struggle. Motivation is stated ("need to restore lost faith") rather than revealed through high-stakes choice, and the internal arc lacks a visible cost or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path of discovery with minimal Causal or Situational pressure; the "days" of excavation are summarized, bypassing the tension of the task. Closure is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (RR), but the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" is a striking, visceral concept that anchors the piece; imagery like the "porous crust of ancient bone" and roots threading through ribs is vivid and specific. The setting actively connects to the central mystery, though the "village" aspect remains vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the environment yields to the protagonist without resistance, and the "demanding" excavation is glossed over in summary. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and the stakes remain abstract and internal without a concrete test on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor of bones as "seeding" is potent, but the story relies on heavy-handed exposition at the end to explain it ("The faith she restored was not in a place, but in the pattern"). The narrative voice explicitly deconstructs the theme for the reader rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, though it occasionally drifts into abstract summarization ("air felt thick with interrupted journeys"). The perspective is stable, but the repetition of the specific prompt phrase "warmly curious" for both the elder and Leila feels mechanical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level imagery is often strong ("xylem and phloem," "ivory beads"), but the prose relies on "telling" regarding emotions ("solemn reverence," "cautious enchantment"). Rhythm is controlled, though the summary of the excavation drains momentum in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core invention—a sundial built from ancestors' bones that measures seasons for the orchard—is highly imaginative and synthesizes the prompts into a fresh, mythic image. This concept elevates a standard "return to roots" narrative above the average.</comment>
