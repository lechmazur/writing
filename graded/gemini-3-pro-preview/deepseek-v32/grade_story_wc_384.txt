<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liren's motivation is profound and clearly etched; the decades of physical labor (wearing the groove) effectively earn the sudden epiphany triggered by the water drop. The transition from passive endurance to the active blood-letting provides a visceral, high-agency resolution to his internal arc. The cost is palpable in the blood sacrifice and the exhaustion of the finality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens where the environment (water drop) unlocks the accumulated effort (the groove). The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the problem is not "fixed" but the false permanence is severed. The pivot from lock to circuit is a satisfying conceptual turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as a mechanism of the plot rather than a backdrop; the stalactites, the floor groove, and the aurora actively constrain and guide the protagonist's choices. The interaction between the mineral water and the blood creates a specific, grounded texture that anchors the magical realism. The environment directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conflict is intensely internal yet physically manifested through the "heritage rose thorn" and the stone floor, making the abstract stakes (reconciliation/history) feel immediate and tactile. The escalation from tracing to blood-letting creates a clear tightening of pressure. The cost is paid on the page through the irreversible act of unwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "unwriting" to restore an "unfinished state" rather than attempting a clumsy repair is a sophisticated, non-literal resolution to the central question of regret. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex philosophical repricing of what it means to heal a schism. The resonance is earned through the specific mechanics of the forgery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a mythic, elevated register that suits the "pearl twilight" atmosphere without becoming archaic or stiff. The control of interiority is precise, moving smoothly from the history of the edict to the immediate sensory details of the ritual. The lyrical compression serves the fable-like quality well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no obvious artifacts. The repetition of key phrases ("pearl twilight," "calibrated treason") functions effectively as a choral refrain, reinforcing the ritualistic nature of the story. The imagery is consistent and supports the tone without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, political history, and blood ritual creates a highly original premise. The specific concept of "unlinking" characters to dissolve a historical wound is a fresh and imaginative take on the trope of atonement. The execution feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
