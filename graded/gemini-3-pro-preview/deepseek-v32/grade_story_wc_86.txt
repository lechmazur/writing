<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal landscape is rich and distinct, grounding the high-concept premise in specific emotional stakes (the hollow apology). However, her dialogue occasionally drifts into authorial speechifying ("It represents a simple truth"), which flattens the character into a mouthpiece for the theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure is impeccable: a clear orientation, a distinct pivot point via the object, and a closure that reconfigures the relationship without over-resolving the war. The ending lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protocol is visibly altered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is tactile and purposeful; the mist and wind press against the characters, mirroring the internal obfuscation and tension. The parapet feels like a distinct, lived-in space that constrains the action effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the tension of the exchange is felt, particularly in the risk of the offering. The conflict is resolved somewhat easily—the captain's acceptance meets little resistance—but the psychological pressure holds the scene together.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Aris explicitly deconstructs her own metaphor for the captain ("It represents a simple truth: we compartmentalize..."), converting potential subtext into a lecture, which diminishes the narrative resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the "furrowed hush" tone well. Dialogue, however, feels stilted and overly formal, lacking the natural rhythm of a tense standoff in favor of thematic articulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-quality and dense with imagery ("silence etched with the memory of gales"). However, a visible typo ("a error of timing") and the slightly overwrought nature of the dialogue prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of the prisoner exchange trope with the specific, domestic object of the drawer pull is fresh and impactful. The proposal of sharing non-military observations is a genuinely ingenious specific detail that grounds the abstract theme of peace.</comment>
