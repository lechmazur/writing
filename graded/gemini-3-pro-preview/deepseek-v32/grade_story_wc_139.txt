<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli is a distinct, well-motivated protagonist whose internal conflict—honesty versus his father’s transactional cynicism—drives the climax. The choice to use the tools of deception (the prep room makeup) to achieve an honest protection is a strong, character-specific resolution. The "fair trade" motivation is clearly dramatized in the final action, though the note borders on over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving from static tension to a decisive breach and resolution. However, the climax relies on the intruders being repelled by the "staged finality" enough to perform only "cursory glances" at the specific target they are hunting; this creates a slight plausibility strain in an otherwise grounded scene. Closure is decisive and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exemplary; the funeral home prep room is not just atmospheric but instrumental, providing the specific tools (cosmetic wax, prep table) that enable the protagonist's solution. The sensory details—formaldehyde, false serenity, the stainless steel shelf—effectively ground the "deathly vitality" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high (Aris's life), and the escalation provided by the breach forces a clear, pressurized choice. The conflict between Eli's values and his father's world is resolved through action that carries a visible relational cost (the note and the defiance).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of transactional value vs. genuine aid is well-threaded, but the ending suffers from a heavy-handed Thematic Echo. The note explicitly stating "I have found my first axiom... The fair trade is..." converts subtext into text, moralizing the closure rather than letting the action speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and successfully blends the clinical atmosphere with Eli’s internal moral geometry. The POV remains tightly anchored to Eli, filtering the "deathly vitality" through his specific perspective effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent with some strong imagery ("poison thread"), but suffers from filter verbs ("Eli watched," "Eli saw," "Eli could feel") that distance the reader. Some phrasings are slightly passive or clunky ("The method was by waiting actively"), which drags on the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a refugee thriller with the specific mechanics of a funeral home is fresh and engaging. Framing the moral choice through the lens of geometric proofs adds a unique intellectual layer to the standard safe-house trope.</comment>
