<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by labels ("reticent," "weathered innocence") rather than dramatized complexity; his transition from recluse to public speaker happens in summary without internal struggle or cost. He functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a living character with contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story violates the scope default by summarizing days of research and a presentation rather than dramatizing a single pressurized scene. The climax lacks causality and resistance; the audience's immediate acceptance drains the narrative of tension and renders the closure unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the library is described, the details rely on clichés ("frozen tears," "dusty windows") and do not constrain action. The specific "post-dictionary" reality is asserted in exposition but does not manifest in the physical environment or the character's immediate interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the scholar faces no external opposition, technical failure, or internal doubt. The resolution—instant universal acceptance of a paradigm-shifting discovery—bypasses all stakes and cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("testament to life's persistent expansion") and moralizing tags ("curiosity never ages"). The resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and passive, relying heavily on filter verbs ("He saw," "He knew") and summary. The tone is uniform and fable-like, lacking the distinct perceptual texture required for a literary voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>High density of text artifacts and loops; phrases like "suspended hush," "fractured sequences," and "weathered innocence" are repeated mechanically (2–3 times each). The prose relies on abstract telling ("The method was arduous") rather than concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the concept of sonic fossils in books is imaginative, the execution follows a generic "vindicated genius" template without subversion or specific human detail. The fable-like structure simplifies complex ideas into platitudes.</comment>
