<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The summoner functions as a cipher for the ritual rather than a character with specific desires or flaws. There is no internal conflict or moment of difficult choice; he succeeds through simple competence, resulting in a narrative devoid of felt emotional cost or character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows a linear path of task completion without a meaningful reversal or inciting pressure that forces a change in tactics. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction—the problem is solved exactly as intended—missing the "Resonant Reconfiguration" or necessary cost for high-band closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "nocturnal haven" is established with functional but generic descriptors ("fireflies," "willow leaves") that signal genre without constraining the protagonist's choices. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than an active force that shapes the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Stakes are high in concept ("unravel the calm of the world") but abstract in execution, lacking immediate on-page jeopardy. The opposition is described as "straining" but does not force the summoner to escalate his efforts or pay a price, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme of silence versus chaos is delivered through explicit exposition and a moralizing conclusion ("best left unmapped"). Subtext is minimal as the story relies on telling the reader the significance of the ritual rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice attempts an elevated, poetic tone but is undermined by the mechanical repetition of forced phrases like "terrestrially cosmic." These insertions disrupt the psychic distance and make the voice feel constructed around external constraints rather than character perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The prose is heavily marred by "text artifacts," specifically the verbatim repetition of complex phrases ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") three times each in a short space. This creates a stilted, algorithmic rhythm that severely hampers flow and readability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of using an origami wing to map silence is inventive, the execution follows a standard fantasy ritual template. The rigidity of the specific repeated phrases prevents the premise from evolving into a unique or surprising narrative vision.</comment>
