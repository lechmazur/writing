<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on direct labeling ("motivation was pure," "purposefully curious") rather than dramatized choice. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; Aris acts as a functional vessel for the plot without embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear task-completion sequence (wait, photograph, leave) lacking causal turns or complications. Closure is symmetric satisfaction—she achieves exactly what she set out to do—without visible cost or reconfiguration of the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting is functional but relies on generic descriptors ("desolate yet breathtaking," "gentle glow") and abstract nouns rather than sensory particularity. The repeated phrase "during the space age" distances the reader rather than grounding the era in specific detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no pressure or escalation; the protagonist merely waits for an inevitable event with sufficient oxygen. The stakes are abstract ("preservation") and never tested by opposition, forcing no meaningful trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme is delivered via explicit moralizing statements ("testament to outlasting oblivion") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The concept of "dawnlit melancholy" is asserted repeatedly as a label rather than evoked through the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The voice is distant and reportorial, often explaining the story's intent ("Her motivation was pure") rather than inhabiting the character's perspective. Phrasing is repetitive, particularly the awkward insertion of prompt terms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Prose is marred by mechanical "scaffold" sentences that insert prompt elements clunkily (e.g., "Her attribute of being purposefully curious drove her..."). The text relies heavily on filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") and repetitive labels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The core concept of witnessing a fleeting lunar flower is a familiar trope executed here without a fresh angle or specific, lived detail. The mechanical integration of required elements prevents organic immersion.</comment>
