<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kai serves more as a thematic vessel than a dramatized character; his motivation is stated via exposition ("rejected false comfort on principle") rather than revealed through struggle. He lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, proceeding from concept to execution without a moment of doubt or high-stakes micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies on synoptic summary ("walked the cove for days," "Another came") rather than a continuous dramatized scene, violating the short-story scope default. The structure resembles an outline of events where success follows intention linearly, lacking the causal friction or "try/fail" cycles required for high-band structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details derived from the "working memory" concept (callus on a hand, tide angles, scent of rot) are vivid and ground the setting effectively. The atmosphere of the abandoned cove is palpable, though the summary mode prevents these details from constraining immediate action in a specific moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract (Man vs. Entropy) and lacks immediate scene pressure; obstacles are overcome effortlessly in summary ("cleared the irrigation," "planted"). The arrival of the trader functions as a reward rather than an escalation of stakes, resulting in a flat narrative arc without felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit essayistic statements ("not a resurrection, but a reconciliation") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the moral lesson directly, which reduces resonance and triggers the penalty for explicit moralizing at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The fable-like voice is consistent and controlled, suiting the mythic quality of the tale. However, the narrative distance is high, keeping the reader at arm's length and favoring generalized observation over immediate, embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("swirling with faint, captured light"), but relies heavily on expository telling ("laced with genuine concern"). The density of abstract definitions ("conception through working memory") slows momentum and distances the reader from the physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of the amber bottle holding "working memory"—raw, tactile sensations rather than polished history—is an inventive and fresh twist on the archive trope. This specific mechanism elevates the standard "rebuilding a ghost town" premise significantly.</comment>
