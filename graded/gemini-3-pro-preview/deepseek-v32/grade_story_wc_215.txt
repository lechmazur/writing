<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elias is defined entirely by static labels ("astonished," "recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than choices made under pressure. He lacks internal conflict or specific interiority, functioning merely as a passive vehicle who obeys the ghosts' instructions without hesitation or personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on broad summary ("One day," "As he worked") rather than a specific, anchored scene with real-time causality. The resolution is a "fix-it" sequence where the central problem dissolves without resistance, and the "Event" and timeline remain vague backdrop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("scorched wasteland," "green memory") without distinct sensory texture. While the stained glass box provides a visual anchor, the environment functions more as a symbolic stage than a lived-in place affecting the character's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually non-existent; the wasteland is a passive condition and the ghosts act as helpful guides rather than obstacles. Elias faces no difficult trade-offs or risks, resulting in a linear progression of success that lacks narrative tension or earned stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Themes are explicitly preached to the reader ("unspoken words were not of regret, but of hope") rather than emerging from subtext. The story relies on declaring its meaning through abstract summaries instead of allowing the imagery to carry the weight of the "tangled covenant."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The voice is distant and expository, frequently filtered through "telling" constructions ("Elias understood," "He resolved") that create a fable-like detachment. The narrative distance prevents any intimacy with the protagonist, making the experience feel like reading a synopsis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers significantly from mechanical "prompt-itis," inserting required phrases like "contextual clues" and "tranquilly perceptive nature" in clumsy, expository sentences. The reliance on abstract nouns and repetitive sentence structures flattens the rhythm and imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "healing the wasteland" fable is executed with conventional tropes and lacks a fresh perspective or specific human complexity. The integration of prompt elements feels like a mandatory checklist, resulting in a story that lacks organic logic or surprise.</comment>
