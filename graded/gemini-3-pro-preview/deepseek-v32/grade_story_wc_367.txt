<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Kael functions as an archetypal figure rather than a fully realized character; his emotions are described via labels ("shadowed elation") rather than embodied in action. There are no significant micro-choices or internal conflicts; his competence is absolute, resulting in a lack of vulnerability or human cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear vignette describing a procedure rather than a story with causal complications. The closure represents a "soft reset" where the storm passes and duties resume without a Decisive Change or paid cost, failing the closure requirement for a felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The visual description of the lighthouse and the mechanics of the light are vivid and distinct. However, the mention of "print news" creates a jarring anachronism against the high-fantasy tone of "centuries of silent stars," disrupting the world's internal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the storm is summoned and steered with perfect competence, offering no resistance or risk of failure. The stakes ("shape a new dawn") remain abstract, and the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through didactic exposition ("His motivation was not merely...", "This was the shaping he intended") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The story tells the reader what to think rather than allowing resonance to build from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from a stiffness caused by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The narrative distance is somewhat remote, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than experiencing the storm's pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose is marred by severe repetition of full prompt phrases ("glass lantern wick" x4, "total internal reflection" x3, "otherworldly routine" x3), creating a scaffolded feel. This synonym freeze and reliance on labels dulls the narrative flow significantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse keeper steering storms is a standard fantasy trope, here executed formulaically to fit the prompt. The lack of a fresh twist or deepening of the premise results in a generic feel.</comment>
