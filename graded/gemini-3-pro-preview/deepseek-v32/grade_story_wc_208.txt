<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are asserted via labels ("spirited," "perpetually learning") rather than dramatized through friction or choice. The protagonist's internal shift is purely intellectual, lacking the visceral, contradictory impulses or felt cost required for high-band interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot moves linearly with a clear goal, but the pivot relies on the object acting (the slide glowing) rather than the protagonist forcing a turn. The leap to understanding the specific "treaty" logic feels unearned by prior causality, reading as a convenient epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "turbine-hum" and "black stone form" are effective and specific. However, the setting transitions (storm to unnatural calm) rely on familiar tropes without constraining the protagonist's physical choices enough to reach higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretically high (survival), but the tension dissipates quickly as the magic object provides the solution instructions. The "cost" of reimagining her art is conceptual and stated, not a felt sacrifice or difficult trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("she understood the core concept: timewoven alliances") rather than subtext or action. This didactic approach prevents the theme from resonating organically or offering meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and reasonably polished but suffers from filter verbs and explanatory distance. The narrative often summarizes the character's mental state ("hollowed out the mind") instead of inhabiting the perception directly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is competent with moments of strong imagery ("dusk bled"), but marred by adjective stacking ("complex, glowing latticework") and some "telling" constructions. The rhythm is functional but lacks a distinct propulsive texture suited to the storm setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The combination of driftwood sculpting with a magical beacon offers a fresh specific method. However, the underlying structure—lost traveler activates ancient device to find the way home—is a standard fantasy template not deeply transformed here.</comment>
