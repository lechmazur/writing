<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation ("prove that coincidences have meaning") grounded in backstory. However, the on-page cost is low; his struggle is primarily interpretive rather than a visceral trade-off or painful sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from a static wait to a decisive act of reinterpretation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the beacon's purpose changes, though the convenient timing of the star alignment relies heavily on the "coincidence" theme to bypass causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting details like the "glass humming pavilion" and the "shard of hush" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, forcing him to rely on the specific machinery and alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined but remain abstract (personal validation vs. silence) rather than immediate or dangerous. The escalation is internal; external pressure is minimal, resulting in a low-tension climax resolved by a single moment of insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in fragments is well-integrated into the mechanics of the prism. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("It simply proved... that meaning could be assembled"), flattening the resonance into a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the melancholic setting. The transition from the "curse" of retrocognition to its utility is handled with smooth psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density ("shard of hush so complete it felt solid"). Phrasing is generally strong, though "retrocognitively blessed" reads as a slightly clunky expository label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inversion of the beacon's purpose—from guiding ships to signaling mere existence—is a fresh take on a common trope. The concept of "silence" as a frozen instruction adds a unique layer to the retrocognition element.</comment>
