<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the concept than a living character; motivation is delivered via diagnostic labels ("His motivation was singular") rather than dramatized through friction. Internal conflict is absent; Ero moves from reverence to understanding without a moment of doubt or contradictory impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the orientation is solid, but the resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved perfectly without cost. The pivot via the birds feels convenient (divination logic) rather than an earned causal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and resonance is vivid and tightly integrated into the plot's mechanics. The environment actively constrains and enables the protagonist's "skimming," serving as more than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain purely conceptual; there is no external pressure, time limit, or risk of failure to drive tension. The conflict is a puzzle solved in a vacuum, lacking the "felt pressure" or trade-offs required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; the ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("He understood now that to navigate without moving was to listen...") rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that suits the subject matter. While occasionally verging on purple ("slice time"), the narrative distance is controlled and the tone remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally competent, but the text relies on repetitive phrasing (the specific phrase "weathered resolve" appears three times) and some strained metaphors. These artifacts flatten the texture of an otherwise polished draft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—skimming resonance across bone towers like stones over water—is imaginative and elevates the story above standard fantasy tropes. The synthesis of sound and navigation offers a fresh angle on the prompt elements.</comment>
