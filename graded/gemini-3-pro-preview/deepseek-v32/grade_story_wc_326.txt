<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Leo is a distinct presence, grounded by the specific "death certificate error" history and the heartbeat implant that externalizes his precarious existence. However, his motivation to "fetch wisdom" feels abstract and intellectual rather than viscerally urgent, creating a slight distance. The emotional stakes rely heavily on the atmosphere rather than a palpable internal struggle or difficult choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the "ink divination" logic is established early, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the resolution feels structurally convenient; the complex problem of "fragmented consciousness" is solved by a single traced spiral and a summarized passage of time ("worked for hours") rather than dramatized setbacks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and precise, blending the "creaking timbers" of the observatory with the sci-fi elements of the projector effectively. Sensory details like the "cool" porcelain shard and the "hollow, resonant silence" strongly anchor the reader in Leo's isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is primarily atmospheric; while the heartbeat counter adds a layer of tension ("frantic count"), the external task proceeds with procedural smoothness. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or moment of potential failure, making the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of non-linear survival and the value of the "unexpected beat" is poignant and well-integrated into Leo's character arc. However, the ghost explicitly articulating the thesis ("The fault was in the assumption of linear decay") triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, reducing the power of the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is polished and consistently maintains the "midnight solace" tone, suiting the high-concept premise. There are moments of slight overwriting ("symphony of beautiful, broken data"), but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is effective, particularly in the use of the heartbeat numbers to pace the action. While generally strong, some adjectival phrasing ("faint, kindly visage," "bureaucratic phantom") feels slightly ornamental and slows the immediate momentum of the ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic "death survivor," digital ghosts, and an ink-based scrying ritual is highly inventive and fresh. The specific combination of elements creates a unique sci-fi/fantasy hybrid aesthetic that feels distinct.</comment>
