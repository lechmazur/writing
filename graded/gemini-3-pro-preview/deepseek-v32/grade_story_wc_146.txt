<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Silas operates as a competent functionary rather than a character with internal geometry; he faces no contradictory impulses or moral dilemmas. His "patience" is a stated trait rather than a crucible for choice, and he succeeds without personal transformation or embodied emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear problem-solution arc with heavy reliance on summary ("Days that bled into weeks") rather than dramatized causality. Closure is achieved through a "magic fix" where the protagonist simply applies his skill with greater intensity, lacking a decisive turn or felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The auditory focus creates a distinct atmosphere, specifically the "silent, discordant note" and the weeping dust. The setting effectively anchors the magic system, though the description occasionally leans into generic fantasy tropes ("hollow mountain town," "starless midnight").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("forever-collapse") but the protagonist faces no active opposition or tactical failure; the solution proceeds smoothly without forcing a hard trade-off. The climax relies on intensity ("furious circuit") rather than a qualitative change in approach or a confrontation with a limiting flaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of sonic restoration is coherent and woven through the imagery of the arch and footsteps. While consistent, the resolution—harmony cures entropy—feels largely assertive and lacks the complexity of a negotiated or costly peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone suitable for a fable, controlling the distance well. However, the reliance on high-register abstractions ("sonic soul," "infinitely patient") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant cliché ("days that bled into weeks," "breath of life," "starless midnight") and adjective stacking that slows momentum. While grammatically sound, the reliance on stock phrases prevents the imagery from achieving the "flawless" density required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "sonic mason" tuning a town via footsteps is an inventive magic system that elevates the standard "stranger heals a town" fable. However, the plot beats themselves remain conventional, lacking a subversive or unexpected turn.</comment>
