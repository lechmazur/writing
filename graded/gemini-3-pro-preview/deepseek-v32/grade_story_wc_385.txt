<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("richly perceptive," "motivation was clear") rather than embodied action or thought. Elara lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her "duty" is stated but the emotional cost is not dramatized in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a synopsis or summary rather than a dramatized scene, with key plot points listed ("came in fragments") rather than experienced. Causality is soft; the resolution is achieved through a simple song without a distinct turning point or obstacle that forces a hard choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The setting provides a functional backdrop with some visual cues ("starlight," "cold stone"), but lacks tactile specificity or constraint. The "serpentine nexus" is named but does not spatially pressure the character's movement or decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract; the "webs of intrigue" are described as a barrier but do not actively oppose Elara in the scene. The resolution—singing to release the echo—is immediate and lacks a visible price or trade-off, resulting in low tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("people echo when their stories are unfinished"), removing subtext and resonance. The moral is delivered as a lesson learned rather than emerging organically from the conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently breaking immersion to insert prompt phrases ("through progressive disclosure") as expository narration. This creates a register clash between the mythic tone and the meta-commentary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Prose is dominated by telling ("She was richly perceptive," "Her motivation was clear") and "to be" verbs. The insertion of required elements as clunky noun phrases ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue") disrupts rhythm and creates visible artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The core premise is a standard "release the ghost" trope with little variation or subversion. The concept of "webs of intrigue" remains an abstract label rather than a fresh mechanism for the supernatural setting.</comment>
