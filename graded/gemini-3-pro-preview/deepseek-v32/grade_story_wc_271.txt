<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("somatic echo," "survivor") and therapy-speak rather than embodied experience. There is no internal contradiction or struggle; the protagonist simply applies a technique and succeeds, making her feel more like a case study than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story violates the single-scene default by using a montage structure ("Days turned into weeks") to summarize healing rather than dramatizing a pivotal moment. Closure is a soft reset—planting a tree—that lacks a visible, paid cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting is functional but generic, acting as a passive backdrop rather than a force that constrains choice. Details like the "automated beam" and "damp earth" are standard and do not exert pressure on the protagonist's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Conflict is internal but low-stakes, resolved through narrative summary ("Gradually, the panic subsided") rather than urgent action or difficult choice. The protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure, and the resolution comes without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative voice ("Her motivation was clear: to anchor optimism in realism"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The ending creates a negative "thematic echo" by restating the thesis as a summary of the character's growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and clinical, filtering the protagonist's experience through abstract therapeutic concepts ("somatic markers," "nervous system"). This creates a barrier to intimacy, telling the reader what is felt rather than evoking the sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive label insertion (the phrase "quietly talented" appears twice as a static tag). Abstract nouns and telling ("curated peace," "relic of the life") replace concrete imagery, flattening the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a formulaic "healing journey" template where trauma is managed linearly with a specific tool. The integration of prompt elements feels like a checklist, lacking an organic synthesis or a fresh perspective on the subject matter.</comment>
