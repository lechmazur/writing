<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies on explicit labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal conflict is stated in summary ("tore at him daily") rather than demonstrated through mutually exclusive choices on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc deflates tension by resolving the central effort through a summary montage ("The following days were a whirlwind"). The climax functions as a speech rather than a dramatized struggle, leading to a low-cost resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid ("scent of frying dough") but remain atmospheric; the environment does not impose physical constraints that force specific tactical choices. The raft city concept is strong but feels like a backdrop rather than an active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes are declared but not tested against active opposition; the developers are off-page, and the community is persuaded instantly without friction. The lack of on-page obstacles makes the victory feel inevitable and unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is undercut by heavy-handed exposition in dialogue ("reminds us that we built this from scraps"). The story articulates its moral clearly but fails to embed it in subtext or ambiguous action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but generic, relying on standard literary phrasing ("riot of light," "silent herald") without a distinct perceptual signature. It creates a smooth surface that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose relies on abstract telling ("brittle optimism," "desperate need") and cliché summaries ("whirlwind of clandestine activity"). These artifacts flatten the emotional impact and obscure the mechanics of the reorganization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "community vs. developers" trope is executed competently but predictably. The raft city setting offers a fresh coat of paint, but the underlying narrative structure lacks specific, non-obvious ingenuity.</comment>
