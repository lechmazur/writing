<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kiran's internal shift from retrieval to guardianship is distinct, but his characterization relies heavily on static tags ("perpetually surprised," "eyebrows permanently arched") that border on caricature. The initial yearning is established through summary ("familiar, hollow pull") rather than dramatized action or specific backstory. The final decision is earned, but the "weaponization" motive introduced late simplifies his internal moral calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and closes with a decisive change, but the central puzzle solution relies on weak "techno-magic" logic (a drone seeing "heat-residual lines" on a cold silicon chip to reveal data paths). This causality break undermines the grounded tone of the forensic investigation. The transition from digital data glitches to a physical lever ("pull") feels slightly gamified rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with high sensory specificity, blending ancient stone textures ("worn stone path," "oxidized green") with sci-fi elements effectively. The atmosphere of "violet twilight" and "indigo" supports the mood well. The observatory functions as an active participant in the story, not just a backdrop, which elevates the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the climax is softened by the late introduction of the employer's villainous intent ("weaponize this frequency"). This makes Kiran's decision to leave the chip a simple moral binary rather than a complex personal sacrifice. A more difficult choice would have required renouncing a valid claim or facing a personal cost beyond merely defying a faceless antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "missing pieces as invitation" is resonant and lands well in the final image. However, the execution is somewhat explicit, with the text explaining the meaning of the signal ("frequency of belonging") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight. The "forensic poetry" concept is strong but under-explored in favor of the literal signal broadcast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady control over the third-person limited perspective. There is a slight tendency toward purple prose ("profound indigo," "luminescent web") that occasionally distances the reader. The integration of technical terminology with archaic descriptions is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flow is generally good, but distinct repetition artifacts mar the polish. The specific phrase "brilliant dimness" appears twice, and the character tag "perpetually surprised" creates a jarring echo in a short space. These repetitions feel like oversight rather than intentional rhetorical devices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of typography ("type foundry matrix," "glyphs") with a sci-fi precursor legacy is a genuinely fresh angle on the "ancient artifact" trope. While the "temple activation" structure is standard, the specific details of the chip and the concept of "usage trails" as star charts offer a unique aesthetic layer.</comment>
