<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's skepticism is stated as a label ("religiously skeptical") but is immediately contradicted by his reliance on psychic radio calls and his instant acceptance of the supernatural, offering no internal struggle. Mara functions solely as a plot device to deliver backstory, lacking agency or presence in the scene. The "drowsy alertness" is told as a physiological state rather than embodied in perception or choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The plot relies on a massive coincidence: a live radio caller describing the exact room and object Alex is currently viewing deep underground, which functions as a Deus Ex Machina. The resolution—a speech to the ghosts that instantly fixes the haunting—lacks a causal mechanism or paid cost. The physics of receiving clear radio signals in a deep tunnel breaks immersion without an established supernatural rule.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic industrial tropes ("rust and wet stone") without specific, tactile grounding. While the beaded valve wheel is a nice detail, the environment does not constrain the character’s movement or choices. The functionality of a radio in a deep tunnel is a significant verisimilitude break that is not addressed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; Alex encounters no physical danger, obstacles, or resistance from the ghosts or Mara. The stakes are abstract ("weight of a swallowed truth") and are resolved by a simple monologue, lacking any moment of doubt or difficult trade-off. The escalation is linear and friction-free.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly sermonized in the narration rather than dramatized ("swallowed truths manifesting as physical weight," "weight... was a moral one"). This violates the show-don't-tell principle and triggers the penalty for thematic echoing, as the story explains its own metaphor to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is functional but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Alex felt," "He aimed to appraise," "Alex understood") which distances the reader. The prose struggles to integrate the required prompt phrases naturally, resulting in clunky shifts in register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story suffers from severe repetition of prompt phrases ("swallowed truth" appears 4 times; "drowsy alertness" appears 4 times), creating a scaffolded feel. Phrasing is often awkward (e.g., "aimed to appraise"), and the density of filter verbs dulls the immediacy of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core concept of a "ghost shift" is promising, but the execution follows a standard "acknowledged the ghost to free it" formula. The unique element of the psychic radio is undermined by the reliance on convenient coincidence rather than investigator skill.</comment>
