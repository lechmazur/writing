<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is rich and consistent, grounding the high-concept premise in sensory experience. However, his agency is somewhat reactive; the pivotal breakthrough relies on passively overhearing a watchman rather than an active investigation that forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's identity, but the path there relies on a convenient coincidence (the watchman discussing the specific poison "Aconite" at just the right time) which resolves the central mystery too easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and strictly integrated, functioning as both a physical constraint and a mirror for the protagonist's internal state. The "labyrinth of shipping containers" is tactile and atmospheric, grounding the surreal elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The internal stakes are well-defined, and the cost of the realization ("sharp, painful shard") is felt. However, the external pressure is low, and the escalation depends more on chance—finding the label, hearing the story—than on the protagonist forcing a crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of erased history is compelling, but the text explicitly explains its own symbolism ("perfect metaphor for his mind"), which flattens the subtext. This direct thematic statement reduces the resonant power of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, matching the "bureaucratic phantom" persona well. The control of psychic distance is steady, maintaining the necessary detached intimacy throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished with strong sensory details ("greasy water," "chill of rust"). The climax, however, relies on summary ("In a flash that was not quite memory") rather than dramatizing the sensory flood, and there is some reliance on filter verbs ("found himself noticing").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the container labyrinth with the concept of memory reconstruction is fresh. The "amnesiac discovers he was murdered/poisoned" trope is familiar, but the setting and "layering" method add a distinct texture.</comment>
