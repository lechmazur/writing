<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("feral nostalgia gripped her," "chronologically confused") replaces embodied emotion. The pivotal shift from jealousy to empathy is summarized as an internal reset rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing of the grave, but the causal chain is soft; the resolution relies on a frictionless epiphany ("jealousy melted") rather than earned narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The setting is functional but generic ("silver logs," "dried herbs"); the physical space dissolves into a dreamscape too quickly to meaningfully constrain the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Escalation is minimal; the protagonist resolves the high-stakes conflict (sanity vs. death) via a low-resistance writing exercise, lacking a moment of genuine potential failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the meaning of events ("testament to jaded wonder," "laboratory for temporal understanding") rather than allowing subtext to emerge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Narrative distance is remote, utilizing abstract summary of mental states ("perception was chronologically confused") instead of grounded, voice-specific perception or immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mandatory elements are inserted as mechanical phrases ("Getting jealous of past selves had become her method"), disrupting flow. Sentence structure is repetitive, often relying on simple subject-verb openers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of a dream chronicler seeing her own grave is engaging, but the "healing through writing" resolution is a standard trope executed without structural or stylistic freshness.</comment>
