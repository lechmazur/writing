<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on exposition and memory rather than active struggle in the present. Her pacifism is presented as a completed state of wisdom rather than a value tested by difficult choices on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a coherent vignette with a legible Earned Stasis closure (sheathing the knife despite the tremor). However, the middle section is weighted down by a lengthy reflective flashback that explains her philosophy rather than dramatizing it through action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the dome to contrast with the desolation outside. The sensory details ("scent of ozone," "dust of collapse") are strong, though the repeated use of specific phrases ("engraved quiet") feels slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conflict is largely internal and retrospective; the only present-moment pressure is the tremor, which occurs late. Elara’s reaction (sheathing the knife) is symbolic but lacks a felt cost or genuine temptation to violence, resulting in low narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly through narration ("weaving it into something that lasts," "humble symbol of transformation") rather than emerging from subtext. The story tends to moralize, explaining the meaning of objects and actions to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the contemplative tone. However, the integration of specific required phrases creates occasional stiffness, sounding more like a list of attributes than organic observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from "telling" over "showing," often explaining the symbolism of items immediately after introducing them. Phrasing required by the prompt (e.g., "senselessly perceptive," "inculcating plants") sits awkwardly within the sentence rhythm, feeling inserted rather than native.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of a healer in a ruined world is a familiar trope executed competently but without a fresh twist. The story fulfills its constraints dutifully but doesn't transcend them to offer a surprising or risky perspective.</comment>
