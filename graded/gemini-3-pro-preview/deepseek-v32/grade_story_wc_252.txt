<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is consistent and drives the central choice, but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("quiet war," "combative tenderness") rather than embodied sensation. The "violence became impossible" beat is intellectually summarized rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible with a clear Decisive Change at closure. However, the inciting incident (the call) acts as a convenient external summon that simplifies the protagonist's struggle, reducing the weight of agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "black sand" and "rugged chaos" work well, though "sublittoral fringe" feels inserted to satisfy a prompt rather than organically woven into the dock's geography. The transition to the mythic space is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake (freedom vs. obligation) is resolved, but the cost is undercut by the romanticized ending where the abandonment creates immediate healing for Elara. The conflict dissolves into a "happy" leaving rather than a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ending relies on explicit thematic summary ("Freedom was not an escape, but an embrace"; "truth of his own nature") to convey meaning. This over-articulation in the final paragraph flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>A clear POV breach occurs in the final sentence, shifting access to Elara's internal state ("her own heart... now open") without a section break. The phrase "permission slip" creates a jarring register clash with the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose leans on abstract noun-adjective pairings ("spectacle of efficiency," "profound disappointment") that create distance. The anachronistic "permission slip" metaphor disrupts the maritime/mythic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "call to the sea" is a familiar trope executed competently but without significant subversion. The disappearing island adds a touch of specific imagery, but the emotional trajectory follows a standard path.</comment>
