<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli is a distinct, well-realized focalizer, and the transition from roadie to appraiser feels authentic. The internal conflict between his need for validation ("confidently uncertain") and his history is compelling. A slight deduction for the diagnostic interiority ("Loss, he told himself, was only a misalignment...") which reads more like therapy-speak than embodied thought in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, using the physical examination of the amp to trigger a natural progression into backstory and realization. The closure—writing the subjective provenance on the tag—is a strong Decisive Change that acts as a Conceptual Repricing of the object. The reflection-heavy middle (Track A reflection-led) is well-anchored to the prop, keeping the present frame stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the "echo valley" of the quarry mirrors the protagonist's internal state ("thinner and unsure"), and the sensory details of the amp (dust, smell, curve of the cabinet) are tactile and precise. The environment and the object constrain the character's focus and effectively charge the final decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Internal pressure builds effectively through the contrast between the auction house's demands for fame and Eli's private knowledge. The stakes are personal and professional, leading to a quiet but meaningful tightening where he chooses integrity over the auctioneer's requirements. The cost is the potential commission or professional redemption, traded for personal truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of valuation versus memory is strong, but the score is capped by the final sentence ("He felt, dimly, to discover purpose after loss was enough, finally"). This is an explicit theme statement that summarizes the emotional resolution rather than letting the resonant action (writing the tag) stand on its own, diffusing the ending's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and authoritative, naturally integrating industry jargon (chassis, monitor, dope) without over-explaining. The "confidently uncertain" motif anchors the narration well. The perspective stays firmly with Eli, coloring the world through his specific fatigue and expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative ("growled past," "insulating himself... with facts"). However, the final sentence relies on a filter verb ("He felt") and abstract summary, which weakens the line-level impact at the crucial closing moment. The diagnostic sentence about loss in the middle also drags on momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a roadie turned antiques appraiser is fresh and offers a unique lens on the value of objects. The execution avoids clichés of the "washed-up rocker," offering a more nuanced professional pivot that feels grounded and specific.</comment>
