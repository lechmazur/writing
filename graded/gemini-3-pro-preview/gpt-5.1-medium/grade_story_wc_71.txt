<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli is a distinct, hypersensitive focalizer whose internal logic drives the narrative. His choice to move the bed toward the "altered corner" rather than retreat is a deeply character-specific resolution that earns the label "creeping normality noticer" beyond a mere prompt insertion. The integration of his professional/personal obsession with the house's behavior is seamless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from observation to ritual to a decisive crisis (the storm/shard) and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the physical act of moving the bed answers the house's "question" with visible cost. The logic holds perfectly under the Accumulative/Textural lens, where density builds to a breaking point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary antagonist and partner; the "corner where no furniture fit" actively constrains choice and shapes the final image. Specific details like the rust stain shaped like the coastline and the "listening device" orris root create a vivid, tactile reality. This category breaks into the 9s because the environment forces the protagonist's hand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are psychological but rendered with physical consequence. The escalation from "testing" the house to the storm's "curtains across the sky" raises the pressure effectively. The cost—sleeping with one's head in a corner that feels "heavy" and "dense"—is palpable and eerie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of animism and memory is handled well, though the explicit "creeping normality" bookends feel slightly diagnostic. However, the final insight—that the house's flaws are a desperate attempt to say "I am still here"—provides genuine resonance without becoming a moralizing sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and observant, matching Eli's "noticer" persona. The refrain of the "daydreaming" streetlights anchors the passage of time effectively. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader locked in Eli's interpretive framework.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("swallowed by the plaster"). However, the repetition of the specific phrase "inadvertently profound" (once for diagrams, once for the house's intent) feels mechanically forced by the prompt, creating a slight rhythm bump in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of communicating with a "haunted" house through furniture arrangement rather than exorcism is a fresh, specific angle. The execution avoids standard horror tropes in favor of a melancholic, symbiotic relationship.</comment>
