<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation ("trace honest origins") that drives the narrative. However, the characterization relies on direct labeling ("tranquilly perceptive," "logical") rather than purely enacting these traits through pressure, and the emotional cost of the discovery remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal link between the blackout (removing "watchers") and the investigation is logical, effectively enabling the plot. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the library's history, though the discovery of the specific folio in the "narrow aisle" feels slightly fortuitous/convenient for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atmospheric pressure of the sunken city is palpable, with strong sensory details ("velvet over rust," "reluctant lips") that ground the speculative setting. The environment actively shapes the mood, though the "tiny manual wick" is the only tool that strictly constrains action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (truth vs. erasure), but the conflict is primarily internal and low-pressure, lacking an active antagonist or time constraint beyond the blackout's duration. The escalation is linear—suspicion leads directly to confirmation without a complicating reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of curated history versus honest origin is well-developed and resonates through the imagery of the stamp and the gaps. The ending provides a satisfying, non-moralizing answer to the central question of what was lost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the atmospheric tone. However, narrative distance is occasionally padded by filter verbs ("she realized," "she believed," "she felt") which creates a slight barrier to immediate immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from filter verb usage and some "tell-heavy" phrasing ("She loved the stamp because it told the truth"). These artifacts dull the immediacy of the investigation, though the rhythm and imagery remain generally strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a sunken library is familiar, but the specific angle of a blackout revealing "breathing" gaps and the use of the stamp as a compass adds a fresh, specific layer. The execution elevates the trope.</comment>
