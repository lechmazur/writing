<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio’s internal conflict—stabilizing as an engineer versus surrendering as an archivist—drives the narrative to a decisive turn. The "helix-minded" trait moves beyond a label to dictate his specific tactical solution (entangling rather than straightening) at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative traces a clear arc from mechanical setup to psychic overload to integration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lio accepts the conceptual cost of losing his singular biography to become the archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and crucial; the "tectonic engines" and geological strata provide the physical constraints that mirror the internal memory work. The canyon's seismic response acts as the feedback mechanism for Lio's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates coherently from the physical trembling of the toolkit to the psychic resistance of the "entangled" dreams. The escalation forces a clear stance shift—surrendering to complexity—that carries visible emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of non-linear healing ("shortest path... not straight") emerges organically from the protagonist's specific cognitive style and the story's imagery. The ending resonates without needing to state the moral explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical precision with lyrical interiority ("equations in starlight"). The control of psychic distance allows the surreal imagery to land with emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold loops. Images like "notes crumbling like chalk" and "silver ivy" anchor the abstract concepts in visceral sensory details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology, optics, and neuroscience creates a fresh, specific frame for the "memory diver" trope. The concept of "tectonic engines" beneath a canyon offers a unique world-building texture.</comment>
