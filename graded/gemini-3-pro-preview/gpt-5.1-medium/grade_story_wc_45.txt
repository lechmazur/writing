<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal contradiction—a skeptic who forgives people but not the universe—drives the narrative beautifully, culminating in a choice that honors both traits. The voice is distinct, and the emotional logic of bone-setting as a form of forgiveness provides a compelling, character-specific lens for the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and potent, moving from a mundane morgue to a metaphysical rescue with earned dream logic. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the crumbling body serving as a tangible, high-cost proof of the successful "correction" and the shift in Mara's reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Specificity is exceptional, with details like "scars arranged like careful handwriting" and "experiments grew beside rumors" doing heavy lifting for the tone. The physical environment actively mirrors the thematic tension between artificial perfection and the messy, "smudged" truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—truth and a life versus the village's easy comfort—and the pressure escalates coherently from investigation to interdimensional intervention. The cost is felt in Mara's abandonment of her safety (skepticism) to perform a miracle she fundamentally mistrusts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of bone-setting applies brilliantly to the thematic question of fixing broken realities ("mistakes into constellations"). The transformation of a "cleft in certainty" into a literal doorway is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration that unifies plot and theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is authoritative and lyrical, maintaining a consistent "perceptual signature" that filters the magic through a medical/skeptical lens. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing the reader to feel the intimacy of the bone-setting act.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally exquisite ("tendons realign like rearranged sentences"), but the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "shrewdly innocent" for two different nouns (contraptions, then the boy) creates a visible artifact. This specific redundancy breaks immersion in an otherwise polished text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inversion of the changeling myth—stealing a tooth to save the displaced child rather than the reverse—is fresh and poignant. The concept of a bone setter acting as an interdimensional bridge offers a unique, grounded perspective on a high-fantasy trope.</comment>
