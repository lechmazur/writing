<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ilen is a competent, focused protagonist whose compassion and skill are established early. While his motivation is clear, he lacks internal contradiction or significant struggle; his success feels inevitable due to his overwhelming competence, reducing the sense of risk on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, effectively translating a ritual process into a global shift. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) works well, establishing the erasure of memory as a tangible cost ("holes in memory"), though the sequence leading there is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the magic system; the brook and the "valleys of silence" are not just backdrop but the active tools of resolution. This tight integration of environment and agency elevates the piece significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes are high (collapse of kingdoms) but remain abstract and distant. The conflict is one-sided; the prophecy is a passive target that is erased without actively resisting or complicating Ilen's ritual, resulting in low immediate tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of silence as a healing, protective force is developed consistently through imagery and action. The ending resonates with the premise, offering a nuanced resolution where safety comes at the cost of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the mythic tone. The POV remains stable and intimate, effectively filtering the world through the summoner's specialized perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally modifier-heavy ("terrestrially cosmic," "paper thin as dried river mist"). The density of imagery is high and generally effective, creating a strong atmospheric texture without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of combating a viral prophecy with silence and origami is fresh and imaginative. The execution avoids standard combat tropes in favor of a more original, ritualistic resolution.</comment>
