<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s internal contradiction—a ghost seeking relevance through bureaucracy and service—is compelling and distinct. Kerran’s agency drives the plot despite physical limitations, and the emotional arc from feeling unheard in life to being trusted in death is poignant and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, escalating from initial warnings to a planetary fracture. Closure is achieved through a decisive evacuation that costs the survivors their homes and the ghost its connection (the bell), fulfilling the requirement for a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the physics of the floating arches and the behavior of the nebula dictate every tactical choice. Sensory details like the "mineral ghosts" in the glass and "discarded vertebrae" of ladders are vivid, specific, and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (survival of the community) and escalate effectively as the environment disintegrates. While the survivors accept the ghost’s leadership with relatively low friction, the environmental pressure and the tangible costs (loss of home, the cracked bell) maintain high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of collective survival and the persistence of care beyond death is woven naturally into the action. The "brambled hope" at the end resonates as a non-literal answer to the story's central struggle, avoiding preachy moralizing while delivering emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and strictly controlled, maintaining the ghostly perspective without head-hopping. The detachment of the dead balanced against an intense desire to help creates a unique perceptual signature that enhances the story's mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-functioning imagery ("discarded vertebrae," "brambled hope") that advances the narrative. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with the tension, and there are no visible artifacts or scaffolding that impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost functioning as a disaster relief coordinator via chalk and bells is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The story transforms the prompt's elements into a cohesive, distinct vision that feels authentic rather than assembled from a checklist.</comment>
