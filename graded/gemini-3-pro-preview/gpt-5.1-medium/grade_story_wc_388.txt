<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from professional skeptic to the very thing he once debunked is executed with masterful irony. His internal landscape is specific and contradictory—distrusting seals but believing in blackmail—making the final choice to withhold the diamond feel inevitable and deeply character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality is tight and propulsive, moving from the shed's investigation to the orchard's excavation without wasted motion. The closure is a quintessential Decisive Change/Charged Poise, where the discovery of the "stillpoint" forces a high-stakes ethical pivot that recontextualizes his entire mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and active, constraining the protagonist with its toxicity ("respirator," "radioactive dust") while serving as the central mystery. Details like "gray, irradiated fruit" and the "loop of chain fused to the base" ground the speculative elements in tangible, gritty textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a bureaucratic safety check to the acquisition of a world-altering technology. The pressure of the environment and the implied threat of the Committee tighten around Theo, forcing a stance crystallization that feels earned and significant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of power and the "lie" of miracles is woven naturally into the plot. The irony of a man who exposes conspiracies choosing to become a secret keeper offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about truth and control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is sharp, cynical, and highly distinct, filtering the world through Theo's lens of leverage and data. The transition from technical observation to the realization of the "secret government" is handled with consistent psychic distance and tonal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold, with high information density in every line. Images like "scattering rainbows into a crushed, fractured halo" and "dust storms scratched the sky" serve the atmosphere without clogging the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic agrarian setting with a hard-sci-fi data concept (the diamond as storage/protocol) is fresh and engaging. While the "found data" trope is familiar, the transformation of the protagonist's role elevates the material beyond standard genre conventions.</comment>
