<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's world-weary expertise serves as a perfect lens for the supernatural, grounding the impossible in labor disputes and mechanical fatigue. The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" feels slightly constructed to fit the prompt, but the decision to act against training manuals reveals genuine character agency and curiosity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is tightly wound; the ghost's pressure leads directly to the mechanical interaction, which triggers the structural breach. The closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change that reconfigures the story's reality with a high conceptual cost—the tearing of the "treaty" between floors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with tactile precision, from the "cracked midway" to the specific "concrete shaft that should have ended in dirt." The inverted room at the climax is a vivid, disorienting image that perfectly pays off the initial atmospheric setup of a building that lies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The external pressure from the ghosts and the physical threat of the bulging ceiling effectively force the protagonist's hand. While the struggle is brief, the stakes are raised efficiently from a repair job to a breach in the fabric of reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of architectural deception ("facades crack from the inside first") is brilliantly integrated into the plot's mechanics. The ending does not merely state the theme but dramatizes it through the literal tearing of the ceiling/membrane.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, blending technical jargon with cynical resignation ("nostalgia to curdle into lawsuits"). The humor regarding the "union representative" adds texture without undercutting the tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with visceral imagery like wires humming like "entrails." However, the integration of the prompt phrase "began when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" creates a jarring tense clash (began/dies) that momentarily disrupts the otherwise smooth past-tense narration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator mechanics with a haunted circus offers a fresh, specific angle on the ghost story genre. The "inverted room" climax feels inventive and earned rather than a standard jump-scare resolution.</comment>
