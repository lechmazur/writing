<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid, treating phobias as concrete antagonists ("knives, crowds...") that define the protagonist's internal landscape. The shift from "backup body" to active agent is earned through the interaction with the child, though the initial reaction to the file burning feels slightly abstract until grounded by the specific beat with the cast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a surreal bureaucratic erasure to a grounded moment of connection and resolution. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist reframes their fear as a weapon, with the legible cost of "trust hurts" acknowledging the pain of the new path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "rusted library" is an exceptional setting, blending decay with the artificiality of the soundstage ("books sealed in clear plastic") to mirror the protagonist's identity crisis. The environment actively charges the final realization about the "illusion of invincibility," satisfying the 9+ criteria for setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high and personal (erasure of identity), escalating through the surreal exclusion by the studio. The turning point with the child's cast provides a clear mechanism for the protagonist to reclaim agency, pivoting the conflict from external oppression to internal repurposing with distinct on-page proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of embracing fear is resonant, but the explicit statement "vulnerability is power, not a liability" in the narration acts as a Thematic Echo that undercuts the subtext. The physical act of decoding the cast communicates this far more effectively than the direct assertion, which lowers the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, carrying a "trembling certainty" that matches the protagonist's arc from erasure to definition. The integration of corporate language ("clerical correction") with poetic imagery ("kinked around fear like a wire") creates a cohesive and compelling tonal texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong sensory details like "shredded call sheets the way kids stare at roadkill." Sentence rhythm supports the tension well, avoiding loops or artifacts while maintaining high information density throughout the interaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double being erased as a "clerical error" is a fresh, surreal take on identity and Hollywood artificiality. While the "wise child" trope is familiar, the specific mechanic of the cipher cast elevates the execution beyond the generic.</comment>
