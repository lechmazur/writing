<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict—caught between the mother's inherited terror and the "trembling idea"—is visceral and drives the scene effectively. The embodiment of fear as a "rough wall" and a "clenched fist" grounds the abstraction well. The Locksmith functions perfectly as a catalyst, enigmatic yet distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is tight and purposeful, utilizing the "viaduct as hinge" metaphor to frame the transition. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator pays the cost of safety to gain release, satisfying the rubric's requirement for a felt shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting specificity is exceptional; the "bruising" sky and "broken roars" of the river mirror the internal psychic landscape. The environment actively charges the final image, where the "looser minutes" of the viaduct facilitate the release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates steadily through the interaction, shifting from the external riddle of the Locksmith to the internal confrontation with the mother's legacy. The stakes are clear and felt—the cost of remaining safe versus the risk of becoming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of trauma as a "door" rather than a wall is resonant, though the Locksmith's dialogue ("fear is not an enemy...") leans slightly didactic near the end. This explicit articulation softens the subtextual power slightly but remains effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, maintaining a consistent melancholic texture. The shift from observation to internal expansion during the magical opening is handled with excellent distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-caliber and dense, though the repetition of "bruise/bruised" (sky) and "pin" (star) within a short space detracts slightly. The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "hush of cosmic possibility" borders on purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a metaphorical locksmith is a familiar trope, but the specific execution regarding the mother's hair and the "vein torn from the dark" adds fresh emotional weight. It avoids generic fantasy by anchoring the magic in specific psychological grief.</comment>
