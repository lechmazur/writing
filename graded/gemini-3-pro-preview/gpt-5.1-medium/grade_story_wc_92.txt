<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iri is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal state matches her external actions perfectly. Her "calmly inventive" nature is dramatized through her preparation of the copper rods and her handling of the sundial. The interaction with Trann effectively displays status dynamics and code-switching without heavy exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and efficient, moving from the blackout (opportunity) to the arrival of the message (confirmation) to the execution (closure). The ending provides a decisive change with a resonant conceptual cost—the locks "forgetting" their function rewrites the fort's reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "bottled daylight" and the mechanics of the gate serve both atmosphere and narrative function. The contrast between the luminous walls and the "smoky bruise" of the blackout grounds the stakes in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tension is situational and situational pressure is handled well, though the immediate interpersonal conflict is low since Trann is an ally. The stakes are clearly articulated, and the risk of "rewriting stories" provides sufficient weight to the final action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of silent, mechanical revolution is compelling and well-executed. The interior monologue explicitly stating the theme ("not one of shouting crowds, but of rewired habits") is slightly didactic, but the final image of the locks forgetting sides resolves this beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and precise, mirroring Iri's mechanic-like perception. The shift from bureaucratic observation to conspiratorial action is handled smoothly within a consistent third-person limited perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("chipped edge spun like a frightened compass," "chains sighed"). The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final sentence is an exceptional example of conceptual repricing through imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a revolution fought through maintenance and lock mechanics rather than weaponry is fresh. The use of a sundial's shadow as a decryption key for a resistance message is an ingenious specific detail.</comment>
