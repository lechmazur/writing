<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Jae’s internal conflict between the Council and Carnival Row is well-dramatized through action rather than just thought. However, the introduction of the specific trait "orderly intuitive" as a nickname friends use ("friends called me Jae, the orderly intuitive") reads as unnatural exposition and strains credibility. The protagonist's competence is otherwise displayed convincingly through the translation of data into graffiti.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative effectively bridges a timeline of months by anchoring the arc in two distinct interactions with Lilo, fitting the mosaic/shard allowance. The escalation from zoning maps to evacuation routes provides a strong causal spine. Closure is achieved through a "Charged Poise" ending that crystallizes the stakes (fight or flee) in a resonant final image, though the middle section leans heavily on summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and functional, with the raft city’s physical constraints (crumbling piers, moorings) directly shaping the plot and the encoded messages. Specific details like the "foundation stone chip" and "neon tides" ground the fantastical elements in sensory reality. The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary pressure vessel for the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established early and escalate naturally from bureaucratic reorganization to existential threat. The pressure points are tangible—rent hikes, security gates—and force the protagonist into a deeper complicity and eventual resistance. The cost of the final stance is felt, even if the outcome remains suspended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "order as a story" versus the chaotic reality of the marginalized is woven neatly into the plot mechanics without feeling preachy. The synergy between the protagonist’s bureaucratic role and the artist’s subversion creates a nuanced exploration of complicity. The ending resonates by reframing the map not as a tool of control, but as a binary question of survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally distinct, blending lyrical observation with technical wariness. However, the self-definition in the opening ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") feels slightly functional and prompt-heavy, temporarily distancing the reader. Once past the setup, the voice settles into a consistent, observant register that suits the "liaison" role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm and sensory density ("phosphorescent paint," "skeleton of drowned suburbs"). While the "investors... like sharks" simile is a bit cliché, the "foundation stone chip" warming against the chest provides a strong, tactile anchor for the internal conflict. Line-level momentum is maintained well despite the summary passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating carnival city with the mechanics of gentrification offers a fresh twist on familiar themes. The central conceit—using graffiti to repurpose bureaucratic data into community survival tools—is an ingenious and specific narrative device that elevates the story beyond a standard dystopian resistance tale.</comment>
