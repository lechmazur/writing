<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman is a compelling, specific focalizer with deep interiority anchored in a distinct worldview. His motivation—fidelity to the botanist’s memory—is clear and drives the scene’s action. A slight reliance on summary for the botanist’s history prevents the highest band, but the emotional cost of his solitary duty is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, using the planting ritual to deepen the central metaphor. The closure—a conceptual repricing of the battlefield as a future garden—lands with resonance. The middle section contains a substantial backstory block (~25%) that, while relevant, momentarily pauses the present momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is excellent, with details like "coral cathedrals" and "bomb glass" grounding the surreal premise. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's choices (planting in cracks, avoiding ammo), functioning as a dynamic crucible rather than a static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent and textural rather than acute, fitting the accumulative lens. The escalation occurs through the deepening specificity of the planting sites (from general soil to buried ammunition). While lacking sharp external antagonism, the internal weight of "uncounted years" provides sufficient drag and cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of restoration without erasure is handled with nuance ("merely accurate"). The story avoids easy moralizing, instead offering a complex view of healing where the garden "reclaims a battlefield without anyone noticing." The final vision serves as a resonant answer to the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical register that suits the fable-like tone. The shift into the botanist’s backstory is managed with clear transitions. Distance is generally well-controlled, though the filter is occasionally visible ("He wondered," "He imagined").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("braided the air," "low language of salt"). Information density is high with minimal scaffold. A few instances of filter verbs in the final beat ("He imagined the battlefield") distance the reader slightly from the image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a coachman, dead languages, and post-war botanical restoration—is highly original. The concept feels fresh and specific, avoiding generic post-apocalyptic tropes by focusing on a quiet, constructive ritual rather than survivalist action.</comment>
