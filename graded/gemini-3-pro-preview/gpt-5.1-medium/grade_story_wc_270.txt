<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Teta Lila is a distinct, resonant force whose "insurgent" backstory informs present action without stalling momentum. The narrator's internal conflict—caught between the plant-fear and the grandmother's resolve—drives the agency in the final release, making the mentor-student dynamic essential rather than expository.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving logically from discovery to decoding to confrontation under a clear Causal lens. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that resolves the central tension of "implanted destiny" with visible social and conceptual cost (defying the Council).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "ghost ribs against blackened mountains" and "rain smelled of burnt oranges" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that serves the tone perfectly. The setting is not just backdrop but an active participant; the bathhouse plants and cliffs facilitate the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined early and escalate effectively with the Council's arrival, transforming a private ritual into a political defiance. The pressure is coherent, forcing a crystallization of stance where the protagonists choose uncertainty over safe control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "evolving tradition" is successfully dramatized through the amber and kite symbols, avoiding abstract preaching. While the dialogue occasionally borders on explicit thesis-statement ("roots that had survived by bending"), the final image of the sprout in the water powerfully reweights the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blending the magical (plant telepathy) with the gritty reality of reconstruction. Narrative distance is well-calibrated, keeping the focus on the immediate sensory experience and the weight of the grandmother's legacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally high-density and propulsive, with fresh imagery ("leaf-thoughts... like dripping resin") that avoids cliché. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the tension, and the text is free of loop artifacts or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of genetic "implanted destiny" with magical realism elements like plant telepathy and kite-script creates a genuinely fresh narrative space. The specific combination of post-volcanic setting and revolutionary grandmother archetype feels inventive and memorable.</comment>
