<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal discipline creates a compelling filter for the narrative, grounding the abstract concept of the "pulse" in concrete action. The shift from physical searching to internal stillness is well-motivated by the established trait of "waiting," leading to a character-specific resolution that feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, layering sensory details to build a "map of sound" that justifies the final Conceptual Repricing. The closure is resonant, transforming the initial motivation ("navigate without moving") into a realized state with the felt cost of ending the physical journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is inextricably linked to the plot; the "towers of bone" and "canyon of endless echoes" act as the primary antagonists and tools. The environment actively constrains the character’s choices, forcing him to rely on sound and memory rather than sight or stride to solve the central problem.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes are internalized but palpable; the tension between the wandering "stray pulse" and the need for bearings drives the escalation. The cost is paid in "stillness," a renunciation of physical agency that feels earned and significant within the story’s mythic logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of history as a "residue of countless choices" emerges organically from the stone-skimming mechanic, avoiding heavy-handed exposition. The ending achieves deep resonance, reframing the protagonist not as a traveler but as a focal point for the past's unfinished intentions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a controlled, mythic distance that perfectly matches the "historically reverent" protagonist. The prose manages the transition from external observation to internal epiphany without breaking the established perceptual signature or slipping into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery like "a tool... was a sentence the past tried to finish." The rhythm of the prose mirrors the skimming stones—precise, rhythmic, and settling into a resonant silence without reliance on scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "harmonic stone skimmer" with the "canyon of bone" creates a unique and memorable premise. The story transforms the trope of the wanderer by focusing on acoustic mapping and stillness, offering a genuinely fresh perspective on navigation and memory.</comment>
