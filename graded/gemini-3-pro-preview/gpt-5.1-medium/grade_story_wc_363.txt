<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nari’s internal conflict is embodied in action; the decision to unweave her life’s work creates a profound, character-specific cost. Her intuition regarding the puzzle feels earned by her vocation as a spinner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and resonant; the magical logic of the puzzle demanding the tapestry operates smoothly within the fable frame. The transition from assembly to magical portal is handled with earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, efficiently grafting bamboo and orchard to isolate the protagonist. The atmosphere actively supports the magical realism, though the "silence breathe" image is slightly worn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is masterful; the cost of the tapestry—ten years of youth—is palpable and forecloses the past to open the future. The sacrifice is a definitive high-stakes trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is strong and emerges from the action, though the line about "latent sacrifice" borders on explicitly explaining the subtext. The ending image resolves the theme beautifully without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable genre. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing Nari’s interiority to color the descriptions of the puzzle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally metaphor-heavy ("stubborn question," "hush of time's unraveling"). The rhythm supports the weaving motif, but a few adjectives clutter the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving and jigsaw puzzles as a method of magical exchange is fresh and tactile. The concept of "warping space" via cardboard edges is a unique reimagining of portal tropes.</comment>
