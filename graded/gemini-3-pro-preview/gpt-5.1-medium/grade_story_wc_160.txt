<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; Arlen's machinist worldview permeates his perception ("encrypted compassion"). The forensic analysis of the adhesive effectively dramatizes his hyper-observance and empathy without exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a strong Conceptual Repricing (the city as a circle/loop), offering a legible cost (loss of permanent supremacy). The council's swift agreement is slightly compressed but earned by the physical demonstration of the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot and theme; the amphitheater's history of treaties and the volcano's dormant power actively frame the conflict. The "breathing" motif grounds the pacing in the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high; the escalation from the adhesive analysis to the council's argument works well. Arlen's intervention forces a decisive stance, though the council's capitulation feels slightly rapid for the depth of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted compassion" is woven masterfully into the mechanics of the floodgates and the social contract. The final image of the chain reshaping the city offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical precision with lyric observation. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Arlen's internal processing of external chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically varied. The recurring phrase "as the building breathes" creates a strong cadence, though its present tense creates a slight friction with the past tense narrative that feels intentional but noticeable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil engineering, political philosophy, and a fantasy setting is fresh and specific. The solution (time-sharing dry ground) feels inevitable yet ingenious.</comment>
