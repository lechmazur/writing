<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marek's motivation is rooted in specific backstory (the sister), and the woman's grief is physically embodied in the freezing tears. However, the protagonist's internal attribute ("weaves truth carefully") is inserted via repetitive exposition rather than demonstrated naturally in the pivotal moment. The interaction feels slightly functional, with the woman serving primarily as a vessel for the mystery rather than a fully resisting agent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc from dream to revelation to choice, with closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the woman's burden. The "psychic detective" mechanic—touching the globe to instantly download the corporate conspiracy—is efficient but slightly lowers the sense of earned discovery. The ending successfully establishes a felt cost (betraying family legacy) without needing to dramatize the aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with strong sensory details like "glitter clumping like wet ash" and the "throat swallowing candlelight" that constrain the mood effectively. The "melted snow globe" acts as a potent micro-setting and symbol. The score is capped below 9.0 due to line-level repetition artifacts in the opening description (glacier/glaciers, carved/carved).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes are high for the client (family betrayal vs. justice), and the pressure escalates coherently through the dream analysis. While the cost is clear, the protagonist functions largely as a guide who faces little direct resistance, which slightly softens the central conflict. The resolution relies on the woman's acceptance, which is earned but happens relatively quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "thin places" and inherited guilt is resonant and well-integrated with the setting imagery. However, the climax relies on explicit moral instruction ("money turned from inheritance into lifeboats") that tells the reader the theme rather than letting the subtext carry the weight. This directive dialogue flattens the ambiguity of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and consistent, suiting the "ghost whisperer" archetype. However, control slips with visible artifacting, such as the redundant phrasing of the protagonist's attribute in adjacent paragraphs. These slips disrupt the otherwise polished tone and prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose contains significant flaws, including a stuttering opening sentence ("carved a candle-lit shrine carved"), a grammar error ("glaciers northern face"), and a jarring loop where the phrase "weaves truth carefully" is repeated almost verbatim in adjacent paragraphs. While individual images are striking, these unforced errors in a short piece severely impact polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a wreck-diver medium and a glacier shrine offers a fresh, atmospheric twist on the ghost story genre. The specific mechanism of analyzing "cameos in dreams" is ingenious and grounded. The execution is marred by technical slips, but the core concept and synthesis of elements remain strong and memorable.</comment>
