<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s transformation from a passive interpreter to a "gambler setting the table" is compelling and earned through high-pressure micro-choices. Her internal landscape is vivid, blending technical competence with cosmic wonder, and the final shift in stance feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Causal lens where the protagonist’s interference directly triggers the "Charged Poise" closure of the window rattling. The inciting incident (sale) and climax (broadcast) are perfectly linked, and the ending reconfigures the stakes without needing to resolve the external debate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is tactile and atmospheric, with the "tuning fork jammed into the clouds" acting as a defining image that grounds the cosmic stakes. Sensory details like the "nervous hum," "gray snow," and "neon ballast" create a specific, pressurized environment that influences the protagonist's mood and actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict is well-braided, balancing the immediate campus politics with the ethereal threat of the Void. The escalation is palpable as the debate upstairs physically intrudes (dust) on Mara’s domain, though the cost of her interference is more potential than immediately paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "stubborn hope" amidst "power plays" emerges organically from the action rather than through exposition. The connection between the community's fracture and the signal's behavior creates a resonant subtext about the noise of human conflict attracting cosmic attention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and assured, seamlessly welding technical radio terminology with lyrical, almost mythic observation ("sky thinking aloud"). The distance is controlled perfectly, keeping us deep in Mara’s competence while allowing the grandeur of the Void to shine.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong rhythmic control ("power play written in radio ink"), driving momentum effectively. A minor deduction for the "hiss like snakes in deep grass" simile, which feels slightly idiomatic compared to the fresh imagery elsewhere, but overall line-level craft is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise offers a genuinely fresh synthesis of campus drama and cosmic horror, avoiding genre clichés by grounding the "contact" in engineering pragmatism. The concept of the signal as a "trickster" responding to human leverage adds a unique layer of ingenuity.</comment>
