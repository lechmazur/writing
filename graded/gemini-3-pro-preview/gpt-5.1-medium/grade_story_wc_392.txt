<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s professional weariness is well-drawn, and the shift from compliance to rebellion is legible. However, the supervisor’s pressure relies on expository internal monologue ("echoed in my head") rather than a dramatized past interaction or concrete present constraint, making the antagonist feel slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient, utilizing the lantern as a clear pivot point to bridge the inciting incident and the climax. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (the decision to report the truth), though the supernatural vision resolves the ambiguity somewhat conveniently, reducing the protagonist's active agency in uncovering the truth before the final choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and specifically rendered, with the "throat clearing" metaphor and the "soft pinging" of rails creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. The transition from the damp physical tunnel to the spectral overlay is handled seamlessly through the lighting, grounding the supernatural in the physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are sharply defined—integrity versus job security—and escalate clearly from internal doubt to an unavoidable confrontation with the victims. The cost is made explicit in the final decision to endanger the budget and job stability, satisfying the requirement for a felt price attached to the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The thematic connection between historical and modern systemic neglect is ambitious and largely successful. However, the internal monologue near the end ("fear disguised as policy") verges on stating the thesis directly, which flattens the subtext slightly compared to letting the entangled imagery speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending bureaucratic precision with a noir-tinged melancholy that suits the setting. There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("I saw," "I realized") during the climactic vision, which creates a layer of distance when immediate immersion is most needed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with high information density and strong imagery ("air itself seemed bruised"). A few phrases lean toward melodrama, and the final paragraph summarizes the emotional resolution ("apology that echoed without sound") rather than letting the concrete action of writing the report carry the full weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "preventable death investigator" with a ghost story about the Underground Railroad offers a fresh, specific angle on subway tropes. The concept of "entangled memories" as data for a report provides a unique, character-specific lens on the supernatural encounter.</comment>
