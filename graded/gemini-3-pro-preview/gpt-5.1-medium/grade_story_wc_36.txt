<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply internalized and consistent; Cael’s shift from commanding to listening is earned through the specific ritualistic actions on page. The "boy died" backstory provides necessary weight to his grief, though the epiphany borders on explicitly stated self-diagnosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The situational drive lens holds firmly, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Cael redefines his relationship to the relic. Closure is distinct and legible, though the linear descent-and-realization structure is somewhat safe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the "listening" quality of the stone and the wind's interaction with the flute directly catalyze the climax. Sensory details are purposeful, integrating the "avalanchingly quiet" attribute into the physical logic of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Internal pressure is sustained well, with the silence of the canyon amplifying the stakes of the ritual. While the external conflict is in the past, the present-tense struggle with the relic provides sufficient meaningful tightening to carry the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent and touching, but the protagonist explicitly articulates the thesis ("mistook duty for conversation") in the final stretch. This direct stating of the moral reduces the implicit resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a solemn, lyrical tone appropriate for the "relic keeper" archetype. Control over psychic distance is tight, staying firmly within Cael’s perception without leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic ("commas in a sentence" is a standout metaphor). The required phrase "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice, which feels slightly repetitive for such a distinct adverb, but it is integrated grammatically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a failed magic-user finding redemption in a simpler connection to nature is a familiar trope. The execution is high-quality and specific, but the core arc follows a well-trodden path.</comment>
