<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s dual nature—official surveyor versus secret witness—creates a compelling, contradictory interiority that drives the scene. Her choice to use professional skills for a private, poetic act is earned by established backstory and grounded in the immediate scene. The cost of her isolation and the finite nature of her resources (ink, time) is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative drive, using the ritual of repair to build pressure against the rising tide. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the repair site from a ruin into a secret archive. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure fits the scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is an exceptional setting that actively constrains the protagonist; the rising tide acts as a physical clock and a thematic antagonist. Sensory details like "marble shoulders bowed under barnacles" and the "tang of old iron gall" ground the abstract theme in visceral reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as the preservation of memory against "oceanic smoothness." Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (the tide) and resource scarcity (the inkwell), forcing a race against erasure. While the conflict is quiet, the cost—the permanent sealing of her own grief—is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "witnessing" integrates seamlessly with the plot mechanic of embedding notes in grout. The narrative avoids heavy-handed moralizing, instead offering the resonant conclusion that "absence, properly mapped, can burn." The connection between engineering repair and emotional preservation is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a precise, melancholic control that mirrors the protagonist’s profession. The modulation between technical language ("load tolerances," "grout and resin") and lyrical observation ("drowned lantern") creates a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few phrases lean toward the abstract ("interlaced absence," "absence layered within absence"), but the concrete imagery ("swallowing the note so gently") largely balances this. No mechanical artifacts or loops disrupted the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic infrastructure repair with poetic preservation offers a genuinely fresh premise. The specific mechanism—using the surveyor’s grout to seal secret histories—transforms the familiar trope of the "secret artist" into something structurally unique and memorable.</comment>
