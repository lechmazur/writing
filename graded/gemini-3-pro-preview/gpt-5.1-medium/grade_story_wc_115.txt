<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc, moving from arrogant skepticism to a shared burden of guilt, is compelling and well-motivated by the atmosphere and Evan's vulnerability. However, the label "religiously skeptical" is repeated three times verbatim, which feels like a mechanical constraint rather than organic characterization, preventing a higher score despite the strong underlying psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Situational/Accumulative drive, where the physical journey into the tunnel effectively mirrors the deepening engagement with the truth. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator's acceptance of the "phantom footfalls" validates Evan's reality and satisfies the central motivation with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength, with tactile and auditory details like "mineral cold" and "machinery running underwater" grounding the supernatural elements. The "beaded valve wheel" serves as an excellent anchor object that bridges the industrial setting with the devotional subtext.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tension between the narrator's skepticism and Evan's desperate need for validation creates a distinct and coherent pressure throughout the scene. The stakes escalate naturally from a physical exploration to a moral judgment, though the external conflict (the fire investigation) is largely backstory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of the "ghost shift" eloquently synthesizes themes of corporate negligence, labor rights, and actual haunting without feeling disjointed. The ending resonates by treating the supernatural not just as a spooky event, but as the accumulated weight of unseen human cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent, balancing a gritty explorer vibe with lyrical introspection. However, the forced repetition of prompt phrases—specifically the clumsy insertion of "reckless abandoned-mill explorer" and the triple use of "religiously skeptical"—disrupts the voice's natural authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the prose contains high-density imagery ("city night clamps shut," "wearing a carnival crown"), the verbatim repetition of "religiously skeptical" constitutes a significant artifact. These echoes suggest a struggle with the prompt constraints that mars the otherwise polished and propulsive line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, specific take on the "abandoned place" genre by integrating the "talk-radio psychic" method and the labor-fraud "ghost shift." The synthesis of elements feels organic and elevates the premise beyond a standard ghost story.</comment>
