<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interiority is rich and specific ("peripherally focused"), directly informing the resolution. While his motivation is clear, it relies partially on a recalled monologue from the Commissioner rather than immediate pressure, slightly distancing the stakes. The "peripheral" trait is beautifully dramatized in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to a specific, mechanically grounded solution (the mirrors and angles). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the device’s function is redefined. The logic of the repair blends the physical and the metaphysical seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the "scars in the marble" and the cavern’s acoustic properties physically constrain the repair method. The locksmith must use the specific geometry of this space to solve the problem, meeting the highest standard for setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are established early ("city was thinning"), but the pressure remains largely atmospheric and conceptual rather than urgent or visceral. The conflict is primarily man-against-entropy, which works for the tone but lacks a sharp on-page escalation of risk until the final test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but articulated too explicitly in the text ("store wonder in the cellar of reason," "borrow awe"). These lines explain the subtext rather than letting it emerge from the action, triggering a deduction for Thematic Echo/over-articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and polished. The "peripherally focused" perceptual signature is maintained throughout. A few moments of heavy exposition ("She had said, simply...") briefly disrupt the otherwise tight focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density and occasional purple phrasing ("coiled like a question," "wounded bird"). While the imagery is often vivid, the reliance on simile to describe mechanical states occasionally clutters the clarity of the physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a timer for "echoes" fixed by geometry and light is a fresh synthesis of fabulist tropes. The execution feels distinct, avoiding generic "magic repair" clichés by grounding the magic in a specific, quasi-scientific process (angles, chalk lines).</comment>
