<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's precognitive curse is integrated seamlessly into the narrative drive, creating a unique constraint that defines his movement and choices. The climax hinges on a visible, embodied micro-choice (slipping vs. kneeling) where his contradictory impulses of fear and duty play out in real time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration; the return of friction is physically felt through the "scrape of stone," paying off the setup with visceral cost. The causal logic of the ritual holds firm within the story's mythic framework, anchoring the abstract concept in concrete action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sensory details of the frictionless world—"glassy sheets," "melted compasses"—are not just decorative but actively constrain the protagonist's tactics. The physical reality of the setting exerts constant pressure on the narrative, making the abstract premise tangible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from the abstract threat of "stillness" to the immediate, physical cost of pain. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, accepting the "tax" of suffering to restore meaning, fulfilling the high-stakes setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of friction as a necessary tax for meaning is powerful, but the ending beat leans into explicit moralizing ("world needed friction the way a story needed limits"). This explanatory summary dilutes the resonance of the final image by telling rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and authoritative, suiting the fable-like atmosphere without breaking character. The narration manages the "time doubling" effect of the precognition with clarity, enhancing the reader's immersion in Arin's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control ("collapsed star dust rose without rising"). However, a few metaphors tilt toward the abstract or purple ("aurora hung lower than fear," "borrowed dawn of courage"), slightly obscuring the emotional precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a physics-based thought experiment (frictionless world) with mythic elements (eel herder, star dust math) feels fresh and specific. The execution transforms familiar tropes into a distinct, cohesive vision.</comment>
