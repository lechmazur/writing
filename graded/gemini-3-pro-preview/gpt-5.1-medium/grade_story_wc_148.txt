<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's active trait of "listening" transforms a passive confinement into agency, grounded effectively in a conflicted legacy. The transition from the father's historical failure to the son's potential success is motivated by specific internal logic and yields a distinct worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a strong Charged Poise, reconfiguring the prison into a library of possibilities with a clear ticking clock ("before they find the bodies"). The narrative moves efficiently from arrival to the discovery of the method, successfully holding the Accumulative/Situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and constrains action, acting as an antagonist that strictly shapes the protagonist's method. Details like the "cylindrical jaw" and "stacked mouths" create a cohesive, claustrophobic atmosphere that elevates the premise beyond a generic dungeon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (survival vs. erasure), and the pressure escalates from physical confinement to the temporal threat of the discovered bodies. The cost is legible in the physical toll of his listening vigil ("numbs my jaw") and the risk of the coming dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "stories sustaining impossibilities" is woven organically into the plot, offering a resonant conceptual repricing of the lie. The lighthouse as a "throat clogged with tales" is a powerful, non-literal thematic image that answers the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through sound and story logic. The voice remains consistent and atmospheric, though the specific phrasing of the prompt element ("cry wolf boy...") creates a momentary rhythmic stumble in the dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and evocative ("oars clicking like teeth"), sustaining the gothic tone without succumbing to abstraction. Occasional adjective stacking ("exhausted bruise," "salt-shot stone") slightly slows momentum but fits the textural drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of Aesop's fable with a magical realist prison break is highly original and well-executed. The concept of the lighthouse preserving "unbelieved" stories offers a fresh, specific angle on the trope of storytelling's power.</comment>
