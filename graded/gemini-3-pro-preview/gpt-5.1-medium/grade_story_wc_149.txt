<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation shifts abruptly from detachment to lifelong servitude. While the returned memory provides a reason, it functions as a magical bypass for genuine internal struggle; the "doubts" mentioned are stated rather than dramatized, making the surrender feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The single-scene structure is effective, and the "bead" acts as a clear causal trigger for the resolution. Closure is distinct and lands with the high cost of the vow, though the brevity of the arc compresses the rising action significantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional specificity and atmosphere. The "glass ribs," "stone wept steam," and "metallic fruit" are not just set dressing but create a constraining reality that charges the final image of the greenhouse as a living, breathing cage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but pressure is undercut by the protagonist's lack of resistance. The conflict is resolved through the external imposition of the past life's memory rather than a difficult, active choice made by the current narrator in the face of the ghost's demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The themes of cyclic debt and transmutation integrate well with the plot. The "endless night" serves as a resonant metaphor for the suspended state of the characters, and the ending recontextualizes the greenhouse effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gothic voice is consistent and atmospheric ("ruin and radiance," "captive moon"). However, it occasionally relies on abstract telling of emotional states ("mournful elation") rather than evoking them through action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative, but specific required phrases like "ephemeral cameo appearances" are integrated clumsily, creating a jarring anachronism that disrupts the otherwise seamless gothic tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an alchemical garden with a ghost story is fresh, but the "reincarnated lover returning to pay a debt" is a familiar trope. The execution elevates the premise, though the plot beats follow a standard trajectory.</comment>
