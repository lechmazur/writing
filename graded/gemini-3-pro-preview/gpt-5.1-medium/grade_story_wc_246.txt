<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct, anchored by a compelling mix of guilt and curiosity. However, the emotional redemption feels slightly unearned; the specific regret regarding the "child whose medication I miscalculated" is a heavy stake to introduce and then resolve via a magical nudge without a commensurate visceral cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting anomaly to the resonant closure of "unbending" time. While the mechanism of the pen is convenient, the constraint—that it can only revise, not erase—adds necessary structural friction and creates a satisfying conceptual resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is excellently realized, with the "gravitational anomaly" serving as both atmospheric pressure and the physical interface for the plot's resolution. The image of the dust holding the "prints of countless footsteps" grounds the abstract premise in a tactile, memorable reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The conflict is intellectual and retrospective rather than urgent; the protagonist overcomes the irreversibility of past mistakes with relative ease once the tool is understood. The lack of significant pushback from the anomaly or a higher personal price for altering reality keeps the tension in the middle band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The thematic distinction between erasure and revision is sophisticated and beautifully executed, elevating the "time travel fix" trope. The insight that meaning exists in the "lean" between events rather than the events themselves offers a profound, non-moralizing resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and evocative, perfectly suiting the "celestial" and contemplative subject matter. The shift from professional detachment to personal engagement is handled smoothly through the voice's evolving confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "falling and floating negotiated an uneasy truce." There is a slight tendency toward abstraction ("trajectories of moments"), but the high density of imagery generally supports the literary sci-fi tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While "editing the past" is a common trope, the specific interface—scratching dust trajectories in a gravitational anomaly to "unbend" history—is a fresh, imaginative synthesis. The focus on "kinder geometries" rather than wholesale changes gives the concept a unique emotional signature.</comment>
