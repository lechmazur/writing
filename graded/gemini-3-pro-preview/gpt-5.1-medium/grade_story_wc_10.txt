<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lio’s interiority is distinct, grounded in the specific sensory experience of his deafness and the world's silence. The shift from trauma survivor to competent researcher is rapid but earned by his established history with the conservatory. The physical cost ("wrecked and waterlogged") anchors his motivation to connect via vibration rather than just abstract altruism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and closes with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose. However, the "note to self" knotted to the lifejacket is a heavy causal shortcut (backstory convenience) that bypasses the need for active deduction in the present moment. The closure lands well, but the setup relies on this convenient prop placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the winterglass conservatory functions as a giant instrument, enabling the solution. The specific properties of the glass and the vibration constraints shape the protagonist's tactics and the final image. This meets the 9+ standard for environment charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal isolation to a city-wide solution. The progression from testing "Grief" to "Wonder" provides a clear deepening of the conflict, moving from processing trauma to projecting hope. The lack of an active antagonist is balanced by the overwhelming environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "unshaken marvels" and the body as an instrument is woven tightly through the narrative. The parallel between Lio’s personal loss of hearing and the world’s loss of sound creates a unified thematic resonance that pays off in the final vision of the "orchestra of architecture."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. The sensory focus on touch and vibration over sound establishes a strong perceptual signature. The tone matches the "winterglass" imagery, though it occasionally risks becoming overly hushed or reverence-heavy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished with high information density ("notation crawling across the screen like frost"). However, the density of "like" similes (drunk whale, poppies, wreckage, muscles, constellations, frost) becomes noticeable, creating a slight rhythmic scaffolding artifact that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "quiet apocalypse" trope with haptic technology and heat-mapping emotions is fresh and specific. The concept of using the city's infrastructure as a tuning fork offers a distinct, non-obvious solution to the premise.</comment>
