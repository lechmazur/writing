<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina’s evolution from an accuracy-obsessed copyist to a revolutionary is a compelling internal arc that grounds the fantasy. Her decision to convert the intruder into a witness demonstrates agency and earns the emotional resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure moves cleanly from the procedural magic system to a situational crisis via the broadcast warning. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration from isolation to shared guardianship, lands with clear thematic logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "ember alcove" creates a distinct, tactile locus for the story, grounded by the "maintenance garage" backstory. Atmospheric details like "ash... sifting down like gray snow" effectively establish the post-famine world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The escalation is driven effectively by the radio's warning lyric, shifting the scene from ritual to danger. While the resolution reduces the physical threat, it heightens the emotional stakes by sharing the secret with a child.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central metaphor—teaching dust to hold memory—is poignant and rigorously explored through the specific mechanics of the plot. The ending successfully expands the theme from individual preservation to collective witnessing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident and lyrical, maintaining a consistent tone that balances the technical details of copyist work with magical elements. The narrative distance effectively zooms in from the city's silence to Lina's table.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and high-density ("spines of interference," "stubborn as cinders"), creating a strong textural experience. The bookending use of "thistled calm" provides a satisfying rhythmic container for the narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of shortwave radio mechanics with a dust-based magic system offers a fresh, specific take on the "preserving stories" trope. The method of hiding instructions in musical notation and verse adds a layer of ingenious texture.</comment>
