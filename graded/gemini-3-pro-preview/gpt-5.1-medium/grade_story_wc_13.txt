<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "natural history illustrator" persona is perfectly maintained, shaping perceptions ("warped outlines") and driving the final moral choice to sketch rather than capture. The shift from employee to arbiter is earned through the sensory pressure of the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawless causality within a situational frame; the journey builds coherently to the "time knot" climax. The closure—a refusal that redefines the commission—lands with distinct conceptual weight ("drawings, not chains").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is outstanding, with the "giant's nap" providing a tangible rhythmic constraint on the world. Sensory details like "shadows locking like teeth" and "air tasted like old bells" create a unique, immersive texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly from physical navigation to metaphysical manipulation. The stakes pivot effectively from fulfilling a contract to an existential decision about the survival of potential futures, though the external consequence regarding the client remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of observation versus possession is woven through the narrative mechanics without heavy-handedness. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central conflict, finding resonance in "absence" and "unborn voices."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and lyrically precise, perfectly matching the surreal subject matter. The shift between external observation and internal realization is seamless, with excellent control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("Sound peeled away... like paint"). Imagery is consistent and serves the magical realism tone, though the density of simile in the middle section is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, imaginative synthesis of the prompt elements; the "rooftop canals" and "time sculpting" combine into a singular, memorable vision. The concept of "sketching absence" as a resolution is artistically ingenious.</comment>
