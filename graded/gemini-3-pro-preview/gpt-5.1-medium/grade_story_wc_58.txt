<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinct and melancholic, establishing a strong, specific worldview ("cartography of wounds"). Sera acts as a compelling foil, though her dialogue occasionally drifts into diagnostic self-analysis ("geography of healing") rather than subtextual interaction. The emotional connection feels earned through the shared action of walking rather than just declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and purposeful, moving from a mysterious commission to a shared, resonant understanding (Conceptual Repricing). The pacing aligns perfectly with the walk, allowing the backstory to emerge naturally within the present action. The closure is legible and impactful, reframing the initial premise without breaking the established fable-like logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with exquisite, textured detail ("bronze nymphs crusted with leaves," "gravel silvered") that actively supports the mood. The garden functions as more than a backdrop; its layout ("high enough," "low enough") constrains the characters and mirrors the thematic tension between hiding and invitation. The sensory details are specific and grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily conceptual—the struggle to define an absence—but the pressure is maintained through the narrator's need to understand the commission. The "tightening" occurs as the narrator realizes they must participate ("Help me walk it") rather than just observe. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal reconfiguration is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of absence as a presence is powerful and consistent. However, the score is capped by a "Thematic Echo" in the penultimate paragraph, where the character explicitly articulates the story's thesis ("nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern") in dialogue. This didactic moment reduces the subtextual power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "high literary" tone that suits the fable-like premise. The narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to the traveler's perception. A slight dip for the phrase "intimate greeting by projecting presence alone," which reads as an abstract summary rather than the embodied voice shown elsewhere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("bare as a stripped altar"). The carpet metaphor is woven through the text skillfully. The line "projecting presence alone" is a minor artifact of abstraction that tells rather than shows, but otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of an obituary writer for the living is inventive and offers a fresh angle on the "traveler" archetype. Blending this with the specific craft of carpet weaving creates a unique texture. The execution feels authentic to its own world logic, avoiding generic fantasy tropes in favor of a specific, melancholic vision.</comment>
