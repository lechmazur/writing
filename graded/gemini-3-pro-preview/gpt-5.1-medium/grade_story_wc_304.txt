<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara is a compelling professional whose duality (artist/priest) informs every action, grounding the magic in specific labor. The shift from professional detachment to personal risk is earned, and the specific micro-choice to place the chip on the sternum rather than the brow anchors the emotional climax in physical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc creates excellent structural pressure, using the earlier bodies to establish the magic's cost (the degrading chip) before the personal climax. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the "static" of death into a "clear tone" that reweights the relationship between the living and the dead.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the magic system; the "auroral curtain" and "ice-rock" fuel the emerald chip's function rather than serving as mere backdrop. The interplay between the environment (the emerald beam) and the final body charges the climax with essential visual and causal weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from professional duty to high-stakes personal risk, driven by the tangible degradation of the tool ("hairline-cracked from use"). The tension is palpable, and while the resolution is affirmative, the felt cost of the chip's fragility and the emotional exposure charges the final moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "threshold of stillness" acts as a profound governing metaphor, binding the mortuary craft to the pilot's philosophy without heavy-handed exposition. The ending resonates powerfully with this theme, successfully capturing "breath returning" in a space of death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident and tonally consistent, blending technical precision with lyrical mysticism ("softening death with rouge"). It manages the shift from observational duties to the intimate climax without breaking the established register or distancing the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, creating a rich texture with strong imagery like "drink starlight like blood." Rhythm is generally excellent, though a few filter verbs ("Elara recognized," "She began") and participle openers prevent a flawless score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sky-faring lore, mortuary science, and memory magic offers a fresh, specific vision. The concept of a beautician who captures the "moment just before" as a service adds a unique, poignant layer to the trope of communicating with the dead.</comment>
