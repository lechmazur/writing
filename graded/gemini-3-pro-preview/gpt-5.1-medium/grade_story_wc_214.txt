<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc relies on diagnostic label-speak ("He realized... was not merely expanding... it was also resting") rather than embodied action. This intellectualization of the emotional peak distances the reader from the "strength in vulnerability" shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causality is driven by the coincidence of finding the lantern, but the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and meaningful. The shift from cleaning to witnessing provides a clear change in stance, though the inciting incident is purely fortuitous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "dust that glimmered like crushed nebulae" and "metallic tang." The setting actively shapes the mood, though some descriptions lean slightly toward purple prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the conflict is an intellectual struggle with "invisibility" rather than a pressured situation. While the internal deepening is coherent, the lack of external pressure or harder choices limits the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative explicitly states its moral in the final paragraph ("find strength in vulnerability instead of armor"), which collapses subtext into a lecture. This "Thematic Echo" resolves the ambiguity too tidily, robbing the ending of resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The perspective stays firmly with the janitor, though the tendency to explain his feelings ("He had learned to empathize") slightly weakens the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from filter verb stacking in the climax ("He saw," "He felt," "He realized") and metaphor congestion ("like a throat," "like crushed nebulae"). These artifacts create distance exactly when the text should be most immediate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "cosmic janitor" concept is charming and the lantern projecting memories is a fresh image. However, the trajectory—humble worker finds meaning through a magical object—follows a familiar pattern without a major subversive twist.</comment>
