<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias is a competent, proactive protagonist whose expertise drives the resolution. The "logically emotional" trait acts as a functional framework for his internal process, though it leans on exposition ("categorized," "flowcharts") rather than dramatized emotional struggle. His improvisation at the climax demonstrates agency, but the internal cost of this "dangerous" adaptation feels somewhat theoretical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Situational arc: a specific atmospheric pressure forces a technical intervention. The causal chain is strong (ice shift → frequency drift → adaptation). Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), restoring balance with a tangible sense of relief ("exhausted, forgiven breath").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and causally integrated; the "groaning" marina and shifting ice directly create the central conflict (the frequency drift). Sensory details like "bruised light" and "iron and salt" ground the fantastical elements effectively, though some descriptors border on abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tension escalates clearly from the "wrong sound" to the realization that the binding note has drifted. The stakes are effectively raised by the sunset constraint. The resolution relies on a competence-based shift (humming higher) which, while satisfying, lacks a visceral on-page price beyond physical exertion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of "sonic absolution"—forgiving matter to soothe it—provides a strong, cohesive thematic spine that elevates the "engineer vs. monster" trope. The ending resonates well, framing the conflict as a communion rather than a conquest, offering a non-literal answer to the central threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending technical precision with mythic reverence. The tone matches the "monk/engineer" hybrid identity well. There is a slight tendency toward adjective-heavy phrasing ("weather-bleached," "rust-darkened," "frost-rimed") that occasionally slows the rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is evocative but suffers from a distinct repetition artifact: "fleshly constellations" is immediately followed by "fleshly ethereal" in the next sentence, breaking immersion. Some imagery leans toward purple ("bruised light," "smeared itself"), but the technical descriptions of sound are sharp and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, acoustics, and sacred ritual creates a fresh and engaging premise. The "weather that remembered dying" is a compelling, original concept that adds depth to the artifact without requiring heavy exposition.</comment>
