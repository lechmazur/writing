<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich and specific ("trusted silence more than speech"), anchoring the "recluse" archetype in genuine motivation. The interaction with Mara is laden with history and subtext, avoiding exposition dumps while conveying deep connection. The choice to open the box feels inevitable yet costly, driven by a consistent internal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is exemplary, landing a Conceptual Repricing that recontextualizes the narrator's vigil without negating the cost of isolation. The visual of the stained glass light spilling across the ghost acts as a powerful, non-discursive climax that earns the final realization. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds firmly from the opening shadows to the final hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "glassy dunes" and "shattered chapel windows" create a vivid, tangible atmosphere that mirrors the thematic fragility. The stained glass box functions effectively as a micro-setting, constraining the climax and charging the final image with light and color. Sensory details are purposeful, blending the apiary motif with the supernatural elements seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is steady and coherent, moving from the environmental shift (ghosts casting shadows) to the specific confrontation with Mara. The stakes are clearly defined as the loss of "unspoken words," and the pressure builds naturally to the unlocking of the shed. The resolution provides a meaningful deepening of the narrator's burden rather than a simple fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of silence versus speech is handled with nuance, avoiding binary simplification. The final realization reweights the "covenant" effectively, though explicitly stating the theme ("true covenant: not between...") risks feeling slightly like a thesis statement. However, the preceding imagery earns this moment, keeping it resonant rather than preachy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "tranquilly perceptive" tone that justifies the high-concept observations. The metaphoric language ("voice weaving... like smoke") generally lands well, enhancing the ethereal quality of the story. Control over distance is excellent, keeping the reader close to the narrator's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("soldering saints and suns"), with strong rhythm and imagery. A minor deduction for the repetition of the specific phrase "contextual clues" (used twice), which feels slightly clinical against the lyrical backdrop. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and supports the story's weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, beekeeping, and the specific mechanics of these ghosts (learning to cast shadows, reading glass) is highly original. The concept of "unspoken words" preserved in a physical medium (grooves in glass) transforms a familiar trope into something fresh and tactile.</comment>
