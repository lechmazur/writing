<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's "molting" trait transcends mere labeling by functioning as the decisive tactic during the climax, allowing them to survive the patrol. The relationship with Lio provides a necessary grounding counterweight, and the internal contradiction between the "vagrant" nature and the desire to build something lasting is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, effective arc where established backstory and props converge to resolve the scene's primary threat. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, as the characters successfully navigate the external pressure using their established tools and traits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the library's physical attributes (rusted bars, loose floorboards, open roof) actively constrain the characters' choices. The atmosphere of decay contrasted with "blooming" resistance supports the theme well without drifting into white-room abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly escalated by the patrol's arrival, transforming the abstract threat of the city into a concrete danger. The resolution relies on active agency—the narrator's choice to adopt a specific persona—rather than luck, satisfying the requirement for protagonist-driven outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of artistic resistance is resonant and well-integrated into the action, though the text occasionally states its thesis too explicitly ("beauty did not have to be gentle..."). The ending image of the "fracture toward light" successfully reconfigures the premise with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical, slightly elevated voice aligns perfectly with the "penny poet" persona, maintaining a consistent texture throughout. The shift in register when adopting the "weary archivist" persona demonstrates strong control over voice as a narrative tool.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, though occasionally verges on purple ("contraband birds," "luminous fracture walking"). There is a minor repetition artifact with the word "contraband" appearing in close proximity in the first two paragraphs, but the line-level propulsion generally holds up well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the prison-library setting with the "molting" poet concept feels fresh and specific. The story avoids generic post-apocalyptic tropes by focusing on a specific, small-scale act of cultural preservation rather than broad survivalism.</comment>
