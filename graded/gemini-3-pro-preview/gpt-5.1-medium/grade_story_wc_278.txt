<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict—hoarding grief vs. releasing it—drives the narrative effectively. The translation gift is seamlessly integrated into the emotional arc, and the final renunciation of the private recording carries visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and decisive closure. The discovery of the failsafe note acts as a slightly convenient linear instruction, but the emotional causality of the sacrifice lands with earned weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sensory details ("dusted vinyl," "rain caught in microphones") create a palpable, melancholic atmosphere. The specific mechanics of the lab (the server rack, the amber) constrain the character’s options and ground the surrealism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure escalates logically from the environmental shift to the personal confrontation with the "baby" voice. The stakes transition smoothly from professional duty to deep personal loss, culminating in a necessary sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "compression vs. living sound" and the trap of grief resonates powerfully. The final image of the meteors burning (time moving forward) offers a resonant reconfiguration of the opening "hush."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the magical realist tone perfectly. The modulation between technical observation and emotional vulnerability enhances the narrative intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled ("opens like a throat in the dark"). A few similes ("like trapped fireflies") feel slightly standard compared to the otherwise fresh imagery, but line-level momentum is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical support tropes with cosmic horror and grief is highly original. The "baby translator" concept is transformed from a quirk into a pivotal plot mechanic with emotional weight.</comment>
