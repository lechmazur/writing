<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lio’s arc is distinct and beautifully physicalized; the shift from a "gravity defier" to a grounded man gives weight to the internal change. His motivation is clear, and while the "labyrinth of self" is abstract, the embodied cost—losing the ability to float—lands effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound with a legible closure unit (Decisive Change/Renunciation). The transition into the "seam" works within the story's logic, though the middle section compresses the struggle of retracing lives into summary rather than dramatized resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is atmospheric and tightly integrated with the protagonist's power and the central metaphor of falling. The "drop and ripple" motif anchors the magic system in the physical environment effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—sanity versus fracture—and the cost of the resolution (accepting gravity) is felt on the page. The escalation inside the "corridors" feels slightly smooth; the obstacles yield to his choices with minimal friction, reducing the sense of peril before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grounding metaphor resonates well, equating flight with avoidance and gravity with presence. However, the thematic epiphany is explicitly stated ("understood then that... did not mean erasing... but bearing witness") rather than left entirely to the subtext of the final action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly melancholic tone that suits the magical realism. It handles the shift from the gritty viaduct to the surreal "corridors" without breaking consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control; "Time seemed pinned between the drop and the ripple" is a standout line. A few phrases lean toward abstraction ("broken electricity"), but the density and flow are high quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "gravity defier" with the concept of grounding oneself in a single reality is a fresh take on the "multiverse regret" trope. The blend of ancient runes and "procedural generation" is inventive, if slightly clashing in tone.</comment>
