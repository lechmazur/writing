<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The negotiator is realized with distinct, embodied interiority; the sensation of &quot;sand between teeth&quot; perfectly physicalizes the moral cost of his profession. His contradictory impulses—disgust at the terms versus the necessity of stopping the killing—drive the scene's central friction. The parallel drawn between his discipline and the general's &quot;operatively gentle&quot; demeanor adds depth to his characterization as a veteran of a different theater.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure successfully leverages the ritual format to build pressure, transforming a static ceremony into a high-stakes confrontation. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing: the signing is not a triumph but a &quot;survivable disappointment,&quot; with the cost of justice explicitly acknowledged on the page. The pacing remains tight, with the ritual steps (salt, ash, water) logically leading to the climax of the amnesty clause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like &quot;crushed mint&quot; and the &quot;sharp memory of rain&quot; create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that contrasts effectively with the weight of the negotiations. The ritual objects (bowls, clipboard) are not merely decorative but constrain the characters' interactions and pacing. The setting of the ancient terrace serves as a necessary crucible for the action, grounding the &quot;forever war&quot; in a specific, tangible location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—peace versus justice—is sharpened through the envoy's resistance, forcing the negotiator to articulate a painful trade-off. The climax is driven by active agency; the negotiator's rebuttal (&quot;decide whether more villages will burn&quot;) effectively closes the envoy's escape route. The cost of this victory is palpable and immediate, satisfying the requirement for visible price in a high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of compromise as a form of moral injury is handled with exceptional nuance, avoiding easy didacticism. The concept of &quot;justice bartered for survivable disappointment&quot; resonates powerfully without requiring a heavy-handed moral summary. The ending image of the sky being &quot;slightly less condemned&quot; perfectly encapsulates the story's complex, non-binary resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the ritualistic context without slipping into melodrama. The POV remains tightly anchored in the negotiator's perception, filtering the general and envoy through his professional lens. While the tone is distinct, a few phrases (&quot;punctuation in scripture&quot;) border on over-stylization, though they remain functional within the mythic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density throughout. However, the density of figurative language in the opening paragraphs (similes involving gods, animals, armor, coins) slightly threatens momentum by drawing attention to the writing itself. Despite this, the line-level craft is strong, with no scaffold loops or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a ritualized peace treaty with elemental components offers a fresh, specific synthesis of the &quot;forever war&quot; trope. The detail of the envoy counting dead with thread on his ankles is an ingenious, character-specific touch that grounds the abstract conflict. The story successfully transforms familiar elements into a unique narrative shape.</comment>
