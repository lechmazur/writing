<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is vivid, shifting credibly from "intrusion specialist" to "opener of doors" via specific beats. However, the self-diagnosis ("I am, inconveniently, spatially gifted") and abstract motivation ("physics of letting go") lean on diagnostic labels rather than purely dramatized friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A strong causal arc moves cleanly from the inciting observation to a decisive physical action (opening the dock). The closure lands with a Decisive Change that effectively reconfigures the protagonist's worldview ("change the model forever") and incurs the cost of safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is integral to the narrative logic, mirroring the theme of transformation ("turning refusal into protein"). Sensory details like "blue-green static" and "constellations where light slipped through" create a distinct, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly drawn between professional duty and human connection, escalated by Rae's intervention and the stranger's gaze. The final choice feels earned, with the cost of breaching the "firewalled perimeter" acknowledged as a permanent shift in the model.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of permeability is well-developed through the mycelium imagery. However, the protagonist articulating the thesis explicitly ("I am wondering what it would take for us to stop acting like walls") reduces subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully blends technical security lexicon ("vectors," "algorithms") with lyrical introspection. The "spatially gifted" perspective is maintained consistently, filtering the world through geometry and alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid ("breath feathering white"), but the prose suffers from repetitive reuse of prompt phrases ("quiet wildfire," "familiar strangers," "revolutionize," "spatially gifted" all appear multiple times), creating a checklist effect that drags on the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-tech security tropes with organic, fungal imagery offers a fresh aesthetic. The concept of "spatial giftedness" applied to a moral choice adds a unique cognitive texture to the standard "guard lets the refugees in" plot.</comment>
