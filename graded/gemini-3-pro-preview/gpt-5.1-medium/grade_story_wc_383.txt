<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Neris's interior guilt regarding her brother is visceral and grounds the fantasy elements effectively, giving weight to the central choice. However, her "skeptic" trait dissolves too quickly; she accepts the Caretaker's exposition without the resistance implied by her characterization, making the middle beat feel passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where Neris shifts from avoidance to "archiving," paying a felt cost in endurance. The structure is weakened by the Caretaker's convenient arrival, which functions as an expository bridge rather than a causal complication, reducing the protagonist's agency in the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sensory details of the hospital memory ("shrunken, bandaged body") contrast sharply and effectively with the "velvet" atmosphere of the garden. The setting successfully mirrors the psychological landscape, anchoring the magic in concrete physical details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes of emotional integrity versus numbness are clear and present throughout the narrative. However, the escalation is undercut by the Caretaker explicitly articulating the resolution logic ("translate isolation into independence"), robbing the protagonist of the struggle to discover this reframe herself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the Caretaker explicitly states the story's thesis in dialogue ("translate isolation into independence"), flattening subtext into text. While the "archivist" metaphor is coherent, the didactic delivery reduces its resonant power and feels inserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical quality that fits the magical realism tone without becoming incoherent. The shift in perspective at the end—viewing memories as files to be shelved—effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal change.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and vivid, but suffers from usage errors in the final stretch ("peoples'" instead of "people's," and a tense clash with "fades" vs "rose"). These slips in the closing paragraph mar an otherwise polished surface.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "garden of memories" concept is a familiar trope, though the specific "quarantine" angle adds a relevant, modern texture. The execution is competent, but the resolution feels more intellectually constructed than emotionally inevitable.</comment>
