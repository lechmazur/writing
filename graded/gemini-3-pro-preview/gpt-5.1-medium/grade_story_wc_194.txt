<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurel's internal burden as the "custodian of ghosts" is rendered with palpable weight, creating a strong emotional anchor. The shift from his perceived power to his realization of the Queen's prior surrender offers a meaningful deepening of character. His motivation is clear and sustains the scene's tension without wavering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scene follows a coherent Accumulative logic, building sensory and atmospheric pressure toward the revelation. The "audio-archaeology" mechanic is established well enough to support the closure, which lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's understanding of history.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid, with details like "mute constellations" and the "sepia reading room" doing heavy lifting to establish mood. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's actions and amplifies the acoustic focus of the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but keenly felt; the tension escalates effectively through the physical engagement with the machine and the rising sensory input. The pressure coheres under the Textural lens, culminating in a moment that feels earned and significant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the physics concept ("standing waves") with the historical theme of political collapse is masterful. The final realization—that the tremor started long before the break—reweights the narrative beautifully without heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the melancholic reflection of the protagonist. The "eloquently silent" repetition disrupts the polish slightly, but the overall control of tone and rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality and dense, though there is a noticeable reliance on "like [noun]" simile constructions (dust like constellations, horn like a flower, crisp as frost). The repetition of the unique phrase "eloquently silent" within a short space reads as a minor artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of steampunk-adjacent technology (acoustic archaeology) with a grounded dynastic exit creates a fresh, specific atmosphere. The story avoids generic "fallen empire" tropes by focusing on the specific physics of the collapse.</comment>
