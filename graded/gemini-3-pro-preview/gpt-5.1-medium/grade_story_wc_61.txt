<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is fully realized, with a motivation ("share light without using fire") that is deeply felt and historically grounded in the grandmother memory. The internal conflict—tending the external garden while being unable to prune the internal one—is palpable and drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is elegant, moving from atmospheric setup to a crisis of faith triggered by the "familiar constellations," resolving in a meaningful Earned Stasis. The closure is earned through the specific memory and the re-application of that wisdom to the present task.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "nebula garden" is rendered with lush, specific sensory details ("petals of ionized dust," "hydrogen veils") that are tuned to the character's unique perception. The setting is not just a backdrop but the medium through which the character interacts with the themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure comes from the emergence of violent patterns in the stars that threaten the protagonist's philosophy. The climax—where the gear shivers and the protagonist must choose to intervene despite the futility—is a genuine tightening of the screw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The exploration of "shining" versus "burning" and the cost of "generational patterns" is masterful. The theme resonates through every beat, from the backstory of the "furnace" houses to the tactile act of extinguishing a candle/star.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, melancholic, and distinct, perfectly suiting an "otherworldly sentimentalist." The narrative distance is controlled, allowing for intimate reflection while maintaining the cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and rhythmically strong, with evocative imagery ("radiance approximates infinity," "shed their layers like old regrets"). However, the verbatim repetition of multiple prompt phrases ("troubling serenity," "approximates infinity") creates a slight mechanical artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a stellar gardener pruning trajectories to prevent cosmic violence is a fresh, poetic synthesis of sci-fi and myth. The specific emotional grounding prevents it from feeling like a standard space fantasy.</comment>
