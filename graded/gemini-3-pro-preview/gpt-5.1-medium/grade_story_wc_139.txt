<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from "honest child" holding coats to an active architect of a new deception is compelling and causally earned. The internal conflict is embodied in the physical action of the autopsy, and the final choice reflects a profound shift in identity (redefining honesty as a "living imbalance").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change where the protagonist actively alters the terms of the deal, incurring the moral cost of complicity. The discovery of the ledger is earned through the specific application of the "active waiting" method, linking plot mechanics tightly to character skill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and constraining; the body acts as a micro-setting ("quiet red cavern") that yields the plot's key turn. Sensory details like the "hum of formaldehyde" and "puzzle cooled to room temperature" creates a distinct, pressure-filled atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (asylum vs. legacy) is tightened by the dawn deadline and the discovery of the "fair trade" logic. The escalation is psychological yet grounded in physical action, forcing a trade-off that creates a new, dangerous reality for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of "Fair Trade" elegantly complicates the morality of the con, elevating the story beyond a simple heist. The ending reframes "honesty" not as purity but as a "breach... chosen with eyes open," offering resonant conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature, blending clinical mortuary detachment with noir lyricism ("ledger full of ruined lives"). The rhythm holds up under pressure, particularly in the description of the ink's effect on the protagonist's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of artifacts; the metaphorical weight of the ink "liquefying rigid categories" is handled with precision. Line-level craft supports the story's "deathly vitality" without lapsing into melodrama.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of forensic accounting, mortuary science, and a magical-realist family legacy creates a striking, non-obvious narrative. The "autopsy of a crime" metaphor is executed literally and thematically with high ingenuity.</comment>
