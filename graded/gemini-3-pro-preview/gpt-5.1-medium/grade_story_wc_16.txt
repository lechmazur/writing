<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between cowardice and the need for connection is vividly dramatized through the interaction with the magical grammar. The decisive choice to accept a permanent constraint on speech demonstrates strong agency and establishes a credible change in character state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal lens where the protagonist enters with a deficit and creates a solution through action. Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise; the internal "lattice" irrevocably alters the character's capacity for evasion before the external meeting occurs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "ossuary of speech" with shelves like "fossilized ribs" creates a distinct, thematic atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal dead ends. The setting is not just backdrop but provides the specific tool (Arithene script) required for the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as the permanent loss of a relationship ("paths diverge"). The escalation works through the high-risk execution of the vow, and the cost—structural inability to hide—is legible and felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of language as a binding moral force is effectively integrated into the magic system. The concept that truth requires a "lattice" where lying is structurally impossible offers a sophisticated, non-preachy exploration of trust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice consistently filters the world through the lens of an "arcane linguist," using metaphors of syntax and grammar ("grammar tighten around me like a harness"). This perceptual signature strengthens the link between character and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("distilled residue of a hundred obsolete dyes"). The writing maintains density and momentum, avoiding scaffold, though a few phrases lean slightly toward the ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a grammar that physically enforces honesty through "interconnected promises" is a fresh, specific variation on truth-compulsion tropes. The execution focuses on the mechanics of language rather than generic magic, adding ingenuity.</comment>
