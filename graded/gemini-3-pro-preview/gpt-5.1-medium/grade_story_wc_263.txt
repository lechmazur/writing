<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle is clear, and the recontextualization of "rest" provides a solid arc. However, interiority relies heavily on metaphorical summaries (e.g., "terror and longing braided together") rather than embodied sensation, creating a slight distance during emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative-to-Causal path, utilizing the astrolabe as a functional pivot for the climax. Closure lands effectively with a Conceptual Repricing of "rest," though the transition from the whispers being "a hoard" to being "mine" feels slightly convenient in its timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the aurora and archway function as necessary constraints for the astrolabe's operation. While atmospheric details are strong ("air that tasted of metal"), some descriptions lean into synesthetic abstraction that borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes—mental relief and creative liberation—are legible, and the pressure escalates appropriately through the mechanism of the falling stars. The resolution, while thematically fitting, feels somewhat low-cost; the "surrender" resolves the tension a bit too neatly into immediate peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of suppressed creativity is resonant but handled explicitly, with the protagonist stating their motivation ("I had come to free trapped creativity") directly. This overt articulation flattens the subtext, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from the action itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the "moonstruck dreamer" persona. However, it occasionally lapses into overwrought phrasing ("careful bruise," "muffled sighs") that calls attention to the writing rather than the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished but dense with figurative language that sometimes muddies the image (e.g., a "careful bruise" is a confusing simile). The high density of metaphors in the climax slows the momentum where directness would have heightened the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central conceit of an astrolabe that charts "unwritten time" by catching falling stars is imaginative and visually distinct. While the "trapped words" trope is familiar, the specific mechanical execution here adds a fresh layer of ingenuity.</comment>
