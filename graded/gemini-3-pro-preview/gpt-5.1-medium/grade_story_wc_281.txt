<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naya serves as an effective crucible, grounding Eli’s abstract crisis with concrete skepticism that pivots to support. Her shift from doubter to believer drives the resolution, though her acceptance of the supernatural element is slightly rushed for the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on a low-cost metaphysical fix (redirecting the light) rather than a difficult trade-off. The ending creates a new stable state (the compass), but the lack of a "felt cost" limits the structural weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio is integrated beautifully, providing the metaphorical language (fiber brushes, beams) that makes the telepathy visuals concrete. The setting actively shapes how the protagonist interprets and solves the problem.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (sleep/sanity) is clear, but the escalation is mild; the protagonist solves the problem through competence without encountering a failure or paying a price. The conflict resolves too smoothly to generate high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of treating empathy as a "design problem" is a fresh and coherent synthesis of the character's background and current crisis. The ending lands a bit didactically ("not to pry, but to guide"), but the core resonance holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the artist protagonist well. Interiority is vivid, though occasionally the prose leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("somersaults of curiosity") rather than grounded sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and evocative ("crackling white," "mica facets"), maintaining strong momentum. A few phrases feel slightly overwrought ("willowglass hope," "fragile memory waiting to be spoken"), but the line-level craft is generally polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visualizing telepathy through the lens of light painting offers a creative spark to a familiar "unwanted superpower" trope. The execution is competent, though the "skeptic partner believes because of a glowing rock" beat is a standard convention.</comment>
