<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation—grief seeking an answer—is potent and drives the scene efficiently. Her internal landscape is vivid, though the realization at the end feels slightly more like an intellectual summary ("Grief sharpened... knot of blame untangling") than a visceral emotional event shown through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from ritual to response to realization (Conceptual Repricing). The "progressive disclosure" mechanism provides structure, though the climax relies on the environment explaining the theme to the protagonist rather than her forcing the answer through a costly choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The canyon is a strong, active presence, functioning almost as a second character with "ribs" and a "tongue." The acoustic constraints are well-utilized. The setting is specific and atmospheric, grounding the metaphysical elements in sensory detail like "juniper smoke" and "grit."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pressure escalates linearly through the ritual—silence, mockery, then the "almost" voice. The stakes are clear, but the external resistance is mild; the canyon yields its secret simply because Liora asks in the silence, lacking a moment of severe doubt or high cost before the breakthrough.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus mechanics is interesting, but the ending leans into didacticism. The story explicitly states its thesis ("Their echoes were not rewards... but debts") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the image of the silence, reducing the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is generally lyrical and consistent, fitting the mythic tone. However, technical or clichéd phrases required by the prompt ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue") create jarring register breaks that momentarily disrupt the "reed-blown" atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with strong sensory anchoring ("flute of bone," "listening like stone"). However, prompt insertions cause friction—"progressive disclosure" reads like technical manual text, and "webs of intrigue" is a worn cliché that clashes with the fresh imagery of the canyon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of an "echo singer" performing autopsies on silence is a fresh, specific take on a grief narrative. The resolution—acceptance of an impersonal universe—is distinct, though the execution follows a fairly standard path for this type of fable.</comment>
