<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific skillset ("landscape astrologer") is seamlessly integrated into their worldview and problem-solving method. Interiority regarding the fire and the "ache to belong" feels grounded and embodied, not just stated. Mira serves as a solid, if slightly passive, foil who enables the protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to a conceptual repricing of the problem ("architecture of attention"). The closure—using the burnt feather to redraw the system—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that unifies the past trauma with the present solution. The causal logic of the bioluminescence appearing in the dark holds up well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the solution relies entirely on the specific properties of the underwater environment (pressure, bioluminescence, condensation). Sensory details like "black glass" and "algae-furred statues" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that actively constrains and guides the characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the internal stakes are clear, the external conflict is low-voltage; Mira agrees to the "against protocol" override with minimal resistance, and the "supervisors" remain abstract. The tension is largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal or urgent, which softens the impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of adapting to natural rhythms versus imposing rigid charts is woven effectively through the imagery. The "burnt feather" transforming from a relic of loss to a tool of creation is a powerful thematic beat. The final sentence leans slightly into didacticism ("teaching me how to belong"), but the resonance is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the "astrologer" persona. Phrasing like "towers like reefs made from forgotten errands" establishes a unique perceptual signature. The transition from technical observation to poetic insight feels natural to this specific focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("floodlights combed," "pale suits licking back the gloom") with excellent rhythm. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike, underwater tone without sacrificing clarity. Minor risk of adjective density in phrases like "softly ingenious," but it fits the established style.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "landscape astrologer" conceit offers a fresh lens on the familiar trope of an underwater facility repair. The synthesis of technical repair with ecological mimicry (bioluminescence) feels organic and satisfying, though the "healing through nature" angle is a recognizable pattern.</comment>
