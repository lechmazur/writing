<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's backstory as a "crisis actor real crisis survivor" creates a profound, embodied internal conflict that colors every observation. The transition from passive liaison to active historian is motivated by a desperate need to preserve truth against "staged" narratives. The reaction to the boy’s recitation—throat closing, silence—perfectly dramatizes the character's paralysis and subsequent resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, layering specific interactions to build pressure before the gallery's closure forces a decision. The coincidence of the boy reciting the narrator's specific tragedy is a high-risk beat, but it successfully complicates the internal emotional stakes rather than resolving them cheaply. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the floor becomes the archive—is earned and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not just a backdrop but a distinct physical constraint that dictates the mechanics of every interaction (trading touch for echo). Sensory details are precise and auditory ("cough at thirty meters," "three beats"), creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The setting is inextricable from the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the abstract (leaderless city) to the personal (confronting the lie of the "staged" disaster) and the urgent (gallery closing). While the external stakes of the interregnum are backgrounded, the internal tension between erasure and preservation drives the narrative. The final decision to "unbind" the archive effectively forecloses the option of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The themes of performance, absence, and the "leaderless system" are tightly braided without feeling didactic. The "pawn who refused promotion" is a brilliant thematic anchor that reframes the narrator's survival guilt. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of historical memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "field medic" detachment that cracks beautifully under emotional stress. The lyrical precision ("swallowed confession," "failed lie") fits the protagonist’s obsession with acoustic integrity. The perspective remains rigorously grounded in the auditory limitations and privileges of the gallery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density in every sentence. Phrases like "morgue drawer for expendability" and "benevolently ruthless" show distinct stylistic control. The repetition of "luminous absence" at the beginning and end functions as a purposeful refrain rather than a loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a crisis actor survivor, a whispering gallery, and a political interregnum creates a highly original narrative space. The concept of "archiving gestures by their sounds" is fresh and emotionally grounded. The execution transforms potential gimmicks into deep character work.</comment>
