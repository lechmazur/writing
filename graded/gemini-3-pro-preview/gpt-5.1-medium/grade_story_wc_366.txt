<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias represents a superbly realized shift from passive observer to active participant, earned entirely through on-page micro-choices (rearranging stones, reading letters). His reticence acts as a perfect foil to the vulnerability required by the ending. The transition from the "shadow between their names" to the one who answers is motivated by a legible, visceral ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a tight, flawless single scene that moves efficiently from the physical climb to the emotional realization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the modified stone signal physically manifests his internal change. The cost is felt—he has surrendered his safety as a bystander to accept the burden of the "we."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric; it is instrumental. The dead lens and the curved panes "slicing... like shattered film" provide the necessary constraints for the climax. The use of the specific geography (the landing, the hollow of the stair) grounds the abstract emotional beats in concrete space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate but potent, pivoting on the question of who guards the dark when the official systems fail. The tension between the "haunted" rumors and the human reality of the letters creates a coherent pressure. The escalation is quiet but steady, leading to a meaningful tightening of Elias's duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of communal stewardship emerges organically, though the explicit text of the letters ("We will keep each other") risks stating the thesis too directly. However, the silent, physical counter-theme of the stone code—danger versus safety—adds the necessary subtextual weight to balance the sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a meditative rhythm that suits the isolation of the setting. The shift in psychic distance—from the boat below to the intimacy of the letter-reading—is handled with precision. The prose texture supports the protagonist’s observant nature without becoming overly detached.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high, with arresting imagery like the boat steered "like an apology" and the beam feeling like a "missing rib." The prose avoids scaffolding, delivering density and momentum. A few phrasings lean slightly toward the sentimental ("luminescent ache"), but the strong physical grounding keeps the text firmly in the literary band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the lighthouse keeper trope is well-trodden ground, the specific synthesis of the stone code and the anonymous letter chain offers a fresh, specific angle. The story successfully transforms a potential ghost story into a meditation on human connection, avoiding the clichéd supernatural path.</comment>
