<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The archetypal characterization suits the fable-like mode, though the "mildly obsessed" trait feels told via hearsay rather than dramatized through a costly compulsion. Interiority is consistent but remains somewhat distant, prioritizing atmospheric perception over emotional conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear situational lens, escalating coherently as the light fails. Closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing (the map redefines the darkness), though the logic of mapping "silence" is more poetic than strictly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable and specific ("stubborn barnacle," "broken hinges"), with the setting actively constraining the characters. The environment functions as a pressure cooker that forces the oracle's task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tension is effectively anchored to the dying star, creating a clear countdown. The stakes are high (existential loss of direction), though the conflict is primarily man-against-nature/fate rather than interpersonal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core theme of navigating despair through listening is resonant. However, the final sentence ("endless only to those who refuse to learn...") is explicitly didactic, triggering a penalty for moralizing that flattens the earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyricism that fits the mythic content perfectly. The perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on textures and sounds, though the register is perhaps too uniform between narration and dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally crowds the action. The distinct repetition of "hush" ("marbled hush," "ambered hush") creates a distracting lexical artifact/loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of cartography based on silence and "hollow corridors" of sound is imaginative and fresh. It effectively transforms the standard "dying world" trope into something specific and sensory.</comment>
