<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; Corren's specific trait of being "gently inventive" directly drives the resolution, turning a necromantic crisis into a moment of acceptance. The internal conflict between grief and mathematical logic is embodied in action, and the shift from retrieval to survival is earned by the on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A flawless causal arc under the 600-word constraint; the inciting desire meets clear resistance from the magic system, forcing a decisive change in tactics. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cost (abandoning the retrieval) is paid to gain a sustainable future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but a mechanic; the "stalactites drip like slow clocks" and the "mute" orchard constrain the pacing and atmosphere. The specific, tactile nature of the glass eyes and mosaic grounds the abstract magic, charging the final image with resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are established early and escalate clearly when the orchard "contracts" and resists the spell. The pressure forces a stance crystallization—realizing that retrieval would be destructive—leading to a meaningful trade-off between desire and integrity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme is woven tightly into the narrative machinery; the "mathematics of emotion" isn't just a tagline but the method of resolution. The ending avoids simple sentimentality by grounding the lesson in a concrete vision of the future, offering a nuanced answer to the problem of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a precise, lyrical control that matches the protagonist's "gently inventive" nature. The perceptual signature is distinct—filtering the world through ratios, echoes, and unfinished motion—and remains consistent even during the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("leaves like dim hands cupping sound"). A minor artifact is the repetition of the distinct verb "dovetail" twice within a short space, which draws attention to the prompt insertion, but otherwise, the line-level craft is publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical logic, taxidermy, and necromancy feels fresh and specific. The concept of "unfinished things listening to unfinished things" provides a unique magical logic that elevates the standard "grieving brother" trope into something distinct.</comment>
