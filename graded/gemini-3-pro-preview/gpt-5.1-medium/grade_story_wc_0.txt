<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lena is a sharply defined focalizer; her internal transition from seeking "catastrophic punctuation" to valuing "silt" is rendered with specific, embodied interiority. Her motivation is clear and reactive to the backstory, though Amir functions primarily as a supportive sounding board rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction. The choice to reject drama for "mud" is felt and grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, prioritizing a shift in perception over external plot mechanics. The closure—taping the leaks to "narrow the variables"—is a resonant Earned Stasis that physically manifests her commitment, though the external pressure leading to this moment is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exemplary; the greenhouse is not merely a backdrop but the scientific instrument itself, with the shattered roof serving as the necessary aperture for the experiment. The sensory details ("smell of iodine," "shivering vines") act as active constraints that shape the protagonist's methodology and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pressure is coherent but quiet; the "fresh squall" and Amir's skepticism provide sufficient testing of Lena's new philosophy, though the stakes remain largely internal/philosophical. The tightening occurs when she explicitly articulates the link between "gutters ignored" and neutron stars, foreclosing the return to her old, dramatic methods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The thematic integration is sophisticated, successfully mapping the mechanics of the flood (neglected maintenance) onto the astrophysics of neutron stars without feeling forced. The story avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex appreciation for the "softening gradient" of decay and truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature that blends scientific precision with lyrical observation ("gravity braided matter into pure equation"). The narrative distance is controlled, and the shift from technical description to philosophical introspection feels earned and seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density in nearly every line ("grief had faded from serrated to dull"). There are no scaffold loops or wasted motion; the imagery of "silt" and "concentric ghosts" supports the central argument without becoming ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of using low-tech dust filters to model high-energy neutron star physics is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that transforms the standard "scientist in a lab" trope. The specific focus on "maintenance vs. explosion" offers a unique and mature angle on the post-disaster narrative.</comment>
