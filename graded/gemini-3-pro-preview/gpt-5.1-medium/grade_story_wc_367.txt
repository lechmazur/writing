<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin is a distinct presence, defined by a specific history of "accidental prophecy" that crucially motivates the climax. The emotional texture of "shadowed elation" and his complex reaction to the hum elevate him above a mere observer. His shift from passive habit to active steering is earned by the established character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear situational lens where the "death of the last newspaper" triggers the lighthouse's response. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the light's purpose from sea to sky with conceptual cost. The causality is poetic but coherent within the story's established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the archaic (lighthouse, wick) with the digital (data-spun oil, dead servers) to create a unique constraint. The lighthouse actively drives the plot by "listening" and "asking" Orrin to steer, satisfying the 9+ requirement for environment as an agent of change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes of obsolescence versus renewal are clearly drawn and escalate as the hum reorganizes the light's reflections. While external opposition is absent, the internal pressure of the "old oaths" forces a meaningful choice to abandon the sea lanes. The cost is the surrender of a comfortable, nostalgic routine for an unknown future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The exploration of media transitions—from "ink-stained rustle" to "algorithmic drip"—is nuanced and avoids simplistic nostalgia. The "shared misreading" line adds depth, and the ending resonates as a transformation of the past rather than a mere rejection of the present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a high-quality, lyrical consistency that perfectly suits the "storm herald" archetype. The perceptual signature is distinct, merging meteorological and technological language ("tasted like static," "measured grace of ships") without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagery-rich, maintaining momentum through heavy descriptions like the "reclaimed silicon" wick. Sentence variety is strong, utilizing the "hum" motif to control rhythm, though a few descriptions bordering on the technical ("total internal reflection") are dense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central conceit—a lighthouse powered by old data and prophecies to illuminate the sky—is a genuinely fresh synthesis of fantasy and sci-fi elements. The transformation of the "newspaper" prompt into a mystical inciting incident demonstrates high ingenuity.</comment>
