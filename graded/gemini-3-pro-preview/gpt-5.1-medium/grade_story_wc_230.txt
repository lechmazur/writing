<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "involuntarily truthful" trait is well-dramatized in the interaction with Risa, creating immediate friction and "fractured grace." However, the protagonist's self-definition as "rational" clashes with their highly lyrical, metaphorical internal monologue ("nervous ligaments," "chewed its walls"), creating a voice-character mismatch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing (the terror object becomes a mirror), effectively reweighting the stakes. However, the climax relies on atmospheric coincidence (the storm clearing the eye) rather than a decisive causal trigger from the protagonist's specific mapping work, softening the agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is integral and visceral; the "hanging orchard" and "nervous ligaments" create physical vertigo that mirrors the internal vulnerability. The environment constrains movement and mood, grounding the abstract empathy theme in concrete, dangerous geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (psychological safety vs. exposure), and the shared vulnerability with Risa escalates the tension. The resolution, however, feels slightly observational; the eye clears *during* the storm rather than because of a hard choice the protagonist made, reducing the sense of earned victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The exploration of empathy as an overwhelming force is nuanced, avoiding simple cures. The ending’s shift from mystical terror to "transparently ordinary" human connection offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is stylistically consistent and controlling, though it elevates the "rational forager" into a poet, straining the character tag. The "fractured grace" tone is well-maintained, and the perceptual signature (seeing scars, lace, and film) remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and evocative ("chewed its walls," "wooden seed pod"), maintaining strong momentum without drag. The prose is polished and high-density, though the phrase "rational truffle forager" feels slightly utilitarian against the surrounding lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of truffles, the empathy virus, and the glass eye creates a fresh, specific world setup. While the "it was just a mirror" revelation is a familiar trope, its execution through the specific lens of "psychological safety" feels authentic and earned.</comment>
