<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s internal desperation is well-rendered, and her specific history of "burning bridges" provides a solid anchor for her agency. However, her epiphany relies heavily on the Shadow Keeper’s diagnostic dialogue rather than a purely dramatized internal shift, and the emotional resolution leans slightly into therapeutic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path with a distinct Inciting Incident and Climax (the scar ritual). Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the final image of burning a bridge "in a different direction" is poetically evocative while remaining causally ambiguous regarding her next physical step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like "dust like soft gray snow" and the river gnawing its reflection. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal hollowness, though the full name of the sanctuary is repeated with a robotic heaviness that detracts slightly from the immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal—emotional survival versus drowning in silence. The escalation works through the ritual interaction, though the conflict is resolved somewhat softly through the Keeper's guidance rather than a hard-won struggle or difficult choice by Mara herself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of isolation and the cost of cutting ties is coherent and resonant. The subtext is occasionally made text by the Keeper ("To teach you how to breathe"), which flattens the ambiguity of the lesson, but the "burning bridges" motif resolves satisfactorily.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately somber for the fable-like tone. It maintains a steady distance that suits the allegorical nature of the story, though at times the prose leans into "purple" description ("light forgot to finish its work") that draws attention away from the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with moments of strong imagery ("warmer than her fingers, as though someone had just let go"). However, the verbatim repetition of the long phrase "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" at the beginning and end reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than a natural refrain, creating a scaffold artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a specific sanctuary for those who "ghost" others is a fresh spin on the "purgatorial healing" trope. While the "scars as stories" element is a familiar convention, the specific application to "burning bridges" gives it a distinct flavor.</comment>
