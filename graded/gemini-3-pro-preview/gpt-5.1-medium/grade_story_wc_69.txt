<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maro's internal landscape ("ache worn thin") and the soldier backstory effectively ground his "magical teacher" archetype, avoiding a purely functional role. The students, while defined by their conflict, serve the fable structure well, and the final choice is driven by character agency rather than mere instruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing an accumulative drive that builds trust over time to a specific closure scene. The ending creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship through the prop, landing with earned emotional weight that justifies the montage-like middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "velvet library" establishes a distinct, hushed atmosphere that supports the "vanishing arts" concept without feeling generic. The zither is used not just as set dressing but as a tactile constraint for the climax, satisfying the micro-setting requirement effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central conflict (community division vs. harmony) is palpable, and the stakes are humanized through Dari and Ilan's specific history. The escalation relies heavily on summary ("Week after week") rather than dramatized beats, but the final confrontation pays off the tension with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but articulated too explicitly by the narrator ("He knew this was not forgiveness yet," "real wounds lay in..."). The story would benefit from letting the subtext of the music and the visual of the rosette carry the meaning without the interpretive gloss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical fable tone that suits the material without slipping into melodrama. The shift from omniscient description to the specific intimacy of the final moment is handled with smooth control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic ("softened the echo of his steps"), creating a strong textural experience appropriate for the genre. A few images verge on the precious or slightly abstract ("breath between pages"), but the density and flow remain high-quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "choir healing a divided community" is a familiar trope, but the specific angle of "vanishing arts" (listening via subtraction) adds necessary freshness. The execution elevates the premise, though the core arc remains traditional.</comment>
