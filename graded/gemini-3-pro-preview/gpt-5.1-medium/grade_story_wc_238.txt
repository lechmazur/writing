<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirabel is a compelling focalizer whose professional identity ("gossip-column exorcist") directly conflicts with her personal need for atonement. The internal struggle is not abstract but dramatized through the ritual; her decision to dismantle her own "metaphorical" shield to offer a raw confession marks a profound, earned shift in character stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving from an inciting assignment to a decisive closure where the protagonist sacrifices her career capital for peace. The pivot from performative exorcism to authentic confession acts as a Decisive Change with visible professional cost, satisfying the closure requirement completely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the archive isn't just a backdrop but a "switchboard" that facilitates the plot. Details like the smell of toner and mold, the "orchard-green" exit sign, and the vibrating rails ground the supernatural elements in specific, sensory grit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict escalates sharply when the ghost rejects Mirabel’s initial offering ("You sold thunder as jewelry"), forcing a tactical change. The stakes are clear: Mirabel must choose between her safe, profitable persona and the dangerous truth, and she pays the price on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story brilliantly critiques the commodification of tragedy, weaving the theme of "metaphor as cage" directly into the plot mechanics. The resolution—stripping away the metaphor to reveal the raw data of names and dates—resonates powerfully as a thematic answer to the central problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending noir cynicism with lyrical regret ("copy grew claws"). The control of distance is excellent, maintaining a close third-person perspective that filters the supernatural elements through Mirabel's specific professional bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative without stalling momentum. Lines like "wind made mechanical" and "bark could pray" show high craft. The imagery consistently serves the tone, and there are no visible loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The concept of a "gossip-column exorcist" using electrical glitches to apologize to a subject she exploited is a fresh, specific synthesis of urban fantasy and media critique. The execution feels inevitable yet surprising, avoiding cliché tropes of haunting.</comment>
