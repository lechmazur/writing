<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct, successfully blending world-weary immortality with curiosity. The internal shift from seeking safety to accepting "direction" is legible and meaningful. However, the character is somewhat passive in the middle section, receiving the core realization via a lecture from the artifact rather than through active struggle or discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (redrawing boundaries) functions as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. The structure relies heavily on the artifact explaining the plot’s thesis ("Here is what happens after goodbye"), which softens the causal drive and feels slightly didactic compared to a dramatized realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "prismatic escondite" is integrated exceptionally well, functioning as both setting and antagonist. The spatial distortions ("walls are at best polite suggestions," "gravity had grown ideas") actively constrain the protagonist and charge the final image, meeting the criteria for the highest tier of setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately: the external pressure of the storm forces a confrontation with the internal desire for stasis. The conflict resolves through a meaningful change in stance, though the resolution comes partially through listening to the fragment rather than direct counter-action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central concept of loss as a "rearrangement of nearness" is poetic and conceptually strong. However, the execution falls into the "Thematic Echo" trap where the artifact explicitly articulates the thesis to the protagonist ("Goodbye... was never an annihilation"), which reduces subtextual resonance and feels instructional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated, precise, and character-specific, perfectly matching the "bored immortal" persona without slipping into cliché. The perceptual signature is strong—seeing the storm as a "crown of bent nails" and geometry as "intrigue"—anchoring the reader firmly in the character’s worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and polished, with inventive phrasing like "gravity had grown ideas" and "lawful mischief of distance." A few early descriptions (e.g., the beams braiding into rainbows/serpents) border on overwrought, but the rhythm and precision remain strong throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and sci-fi elements, particularly the concept of a "spatial mutiny" and the geometric interpretation of grief. The "bored immortal" trope is revitalized by the specific, mathematical nature of the magic and the setting.</comment>
