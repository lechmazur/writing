<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's shift from detached investigator to active witness is compelling and well-motivated by the encounter. While the Keeper serves as an effective catalyst, he leans heavily into a "mystical guide" archetype, existing primarily to dispense wisdom rather than functioning as a fully embodied individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and tight, effectively transitioning from a bureaucratic inquiry to a metaphysical reconfiguration (RR) without wasted motion. Closure is resonant, with the narrator's acceptance of the boutonnière marking a legible, costly shift in stance that satisfies the "routine inquiry" setup with an unexpected depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "opal dock in mist" is rendered with vivid, atmospheric specificity that actively grounds the surreal elements. The setting is not merely a backdrop but pressures the narrator's perception, mirroring the liminal state of the investigation and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate quietly but effectively from a routine report to the heavier burden of existential witnessing. The conflict is resolved through a meaningful internal reconfiguration, and while external opposition is minimal, the pressure of the Keeper's reality successfully forces a defining choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing is poignant but articulated too explicitly in the Keeper's dialogue ("only the lonely leave instructions," "my trade is borrowed memories"). This reliance on "theme-speak" converts subtext into text, rendering the thematic argument slightly didactic rather than discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric, perfectly suiting the mood. However, the Keeper's dialogue feels overly stylized and aphoristic, occasionally breaking the illusion of a natural conversation to deliver prepared philosophical lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery like the "lantern caged in rust" driving momentum. A few metaphors lean toward cliché ("shivered like a living thing") or pathetic fallacy ("refused to admit"), but the overall rhythm and information density are high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of "borrowed memories" adds a distinct, melancholic layer to the familiar "mysterious lighthouse" trope. The execution transforms standard elements into a cohesive, mood-driven narrative that feels fresh despite its traditional roots.</comment>
