<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Iri’s internal conflict between machine protocols and the role of a "listener" is effectively dramatized through the interaction with the leaf. The shift from observer to participant is earned, though the emotional cost of the final choice feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving logically from mapping the known (human traces) to engaging the unknown (spiral entity). Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming Iri’s function into a bridge between worlds, though the rapid pacing compresses the build-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "sensory heat-map" concept allows for rich, synesthetic descriptions that ground the setting deeply in the POV's unique perception ("sorrow burned bright blue"). The cave and water function well as physical constraints that shape the protagonist's movement and final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes shift clearly from historical preservation to active communication, providing a distinct escalation. The pressure is largely atmospheric; while the "unknown drawing nearer" raises tension, the brevity limits the accumulation of dread or difficulty before the final decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of "transitional objects" is beautifully integrated, recontextualizing the protagonist’s own role as a transition between the sleeping human era and what comes next. The theme resonates naturally through the mechanics of the plot without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is atmospheric and consistent, balancing the analytical nature of the protagonist with the lyrical quality of the setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining a tight focus on Iri’s sensory experience throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery is evocative ("slow, silent auroras," "ribs of an ancient whale"), but sentence initiators become repetitive in the middle section ("Iri knelt," "Iri read," "Iri realized," "Iri followed"). This creates a staccato rhythm that drags slightly against the fluid tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of emotional mapping with spelunking creates a fresh, specific angle on the post-human guardian trope. The interpretation of the "spiral" as a non-human signature provides a satisfying, non-obvious turn that deepens the world-building.</comment>
