<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s internal pivot from "tending locks" to "reflecting light" is grounded in specific, embodied history. While the label "wistfully pragmatic" is a bit direct, her actions—using cracked teacups and building the mobile—make the trait distinct and credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure elegantly folds backstory into the present action without stalling momentum. Closure is excellent: the construction of the mobile is a decisive, earned change in stance that yields an immediate, resonant result with the neighbor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's engine; the "luminous harbor" is not just scenery but the active incitement for the plot. The tactile details of the fire escape—soot, peeling paint, stripped cane—anchor the lyricism in grit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate but legible: the choice between the safety of hiding and the vulnerability of signaling. The escalation is quiet, driven by the "invitation" of the light, leading to a concrete physical risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor—the lockmaster's tooth repurposed from closing things to catching light—perfectly integrates the backstory with the theme. The final repricing of vulnerability as a form of guarding is profound and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, managing the psychic distance between Mara's memories and the immediate sensory experience well. The repetition of key phrases functions effectively as a structural echo rather than accidental redundancy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("masts write faint calligraphy"), maintaining strong rhythm. While the insertion of prompt-specific phrases is occasionally conspicuous, the surrounding imagery absorbs them well, creating a coherent textural pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the urban gardener trope with the specific lockmaster legacy creates a fresh emotional landscape. The focus on a specific, odd tool to bridge the gap between isolation and connection feels genuine and non-derivative.</comment>
