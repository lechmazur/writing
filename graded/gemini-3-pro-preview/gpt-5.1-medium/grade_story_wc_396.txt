<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ira is a competent protagonist whose specific trait (intuition over argument) drives the resolution. His internal state is well-rendered, though the pivot from "should have argued" to the mirror method feels slightly frictionless; the cost is intellectual rather than deeply visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, moving from negotiation to a resonant reconfiguration of the terms. The resolution relies heavily on fable-logic—assuming the Keepers will accept a "moral claim" argument—which works for the tone but softens the causal hardness of the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, blending the surreal (orchard on ice, vintage store in lighthouse) with sensory specificity ("dust and stormwater"). The environment actively participates in the plot, providing the tools (mirrors) for resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (war vs. sanctuary) and escalate through the visions in the crystal. The pressure is coherent, leading to a decisive shift in tactics, though the antagonist force (the Keepers) remains distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as a policy tool is well-integrated with the mechanics of the magic. The ending effectively "reprices" the concept of a treaty from a document of control to one of recognition, landing with thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the magical realism elements. The POV remains firmly with Ira, filtering the strange environment through his peacekeeping training.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric ("lanterns swinging like low moons"). The mandatory phrases are integrated smoothly, though the adjective density ("shadow-laced," "calmly intuitive") is slightly high in the opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a diplomatic thriller with a surreal fantasy setting is fresh. The concept of using mirrors to "draft" a treaty by gauging emotional reaction is a genuinely inventive metaphor for mediation.</comment>
