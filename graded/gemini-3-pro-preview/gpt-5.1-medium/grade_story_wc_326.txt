<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "death certificate error" backstory and the resulting heartbeat-counting compulsion are seamlessly woven into the narrative present, creating a distinct, neurotic interiority. The closure—where he forgets to count—demonstrates a decisive internal shift (Resonant Reconfiguration) earned by the external breakthrough. The character's specific competence and vulnerability are balanced well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens where the accumulated pressure of failure meets the chance catalyst of the ink spill. While the ink spill is a "Newton's apple" coincidence, it triggers a memory-based realization rather than mechanically solving the plot, preserving agency. The closure lands with legible cost: the abandonment of the "perfect" reconstruction for a flawed, evolving reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exemplary; the "porcelain shard fused with broken server glass" is a concise, high-impact micro-setting that anchors the backstory physically. The environment actively charges the imagery (snowflakes freezing pixelated, ice cracking), mirroring the digital/organic fusion of the plot. The observatory feels lived-in and specifically wired for this character's grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established via the "last sanctioned night" time pressure and the protagonist's fragile sanity. The escalation from meticulous failure to chaotic, intuitive recoding is well-paced. The tension holds until the final release, where the cost of the transformation (Lian is not the same) is accepted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The themes of grief, non-linearity, and acceptance are woven intelligently through the motif of "glitches" and "patterns." However, the final sentence ("I realize I have not resurrected her as she was...") explicitly summarizes the thematic conclusion, slightly flattening the resonance of the preceding image. Trusting the "jolting bursts" of text to carry the meaning would have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent "tech-noir" lyricism ("checksum scars," "digital ghost") that fits the protagonist’s obsession. The transition from the rigid counting of heartbeats to the fluid "cadence" of the ending is reflected in the rhythm of the prose. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering all sensory details through the lens of grief and code.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and density is high; phrases like "trembling typo" and "observatory's ribs" do double duty for character and setting. There are minor moments of slightly heightened melodrama ("shapes that made my throat close"), but the technical metaphors ("failed reconstruction algorithms") ground the emotion effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "digital ghost" trope with the "survivor of bureaucratic death" backstory creates a fresh, symmetrical premise. The resolution through "non-linear" logic, while bordering on technobabble, is grounded well in the established character dynamics (Lian's personality).</comment>
