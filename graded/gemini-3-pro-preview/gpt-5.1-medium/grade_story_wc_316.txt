<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc—from seeking feeling to accepting the pain of guilt—is dramatized beautifully through the combat mechanics. The realization that winning requires a monstrous numbness forces a choice that satisfies the internal motivation while imperiling the external goal. The distinction between Arin-prime and Arin-2 is efficiently drawn through their differing attachments to the origin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively as an Earned Stasis: the protagonist refuses the winning strike to preserve moral integrity, accepting the risk of erasure. The drive lens (Causal) holds firm, linking the internal need to feel with the external mechanic of memory combat. The narrative orientation is rapid and effective, grounding a surreal concept immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting acts as more than a backdrop; the projection of memories onto the dojo floor integrates the environment directly into the conflict. The "floating rock" and "ruined courthouse" provide strong atmospheric grounding. The visual of history rewriting itself in the sky offers a poignant contrast to the static, frozen nature of the custody battle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are existential and clearly defined: custody of the self versus total erasure. The escalation moves cleanly from legal argument to physical/psychic combat, deepening the conflict by making the "winning move" morally abhorrent. The cost of the final decision is palpable—potentially losing the trial to save a painful memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of defining humanity through the acceptance of negative emotions resonates strongly. The "ego death" backstory integrates well with the struggle against numbness. The ending avoids a tidy moral victory in favor of a complex, risky affirmation of guilt, though the dialogue concerning "infinite" selves is slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending legal formalism with introspective melancholy. The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the surreal imagery through the protagonist's numb-yet-seeking perspective. A minor slip in tonal consistency occurs with the "fizzed like soda" simile, which feels too mundane for the high-concept setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with high density and evocative imagery ("motives twitching in the open"). However, the forced insertion of the prompt word "vivify" into dialogue results in awkward phrasing that briefly disrupts the otherwise smooth rhythm. The combat descriptions are sharp and active.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes disparate prompt elements—clones, floating dojos, and legal drama—into a cohesive and fresh narrative. The concept of fighting inside memories to determine legal custody is an ingenious twist on the "trial by combat" trope, elevating it beyond a simple physical brawl.</comment>
