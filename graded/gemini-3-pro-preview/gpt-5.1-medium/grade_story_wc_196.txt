<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal parallel between the archives and her own history adds depth. However, her characterization relies partly on summary ("broken-hearted archivist") rather than dramatized interpersonal friction until the visitors arrive. The choice to persist is earned, though the internal conflict remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story relies on a summary bridge ("As weeks unfurled into months") that diffuses the immediate pressure of a single scene, pushing it toward a synopsis feel. While the Accumulative lens functions, the time compression lowers the visceral cost of the climax. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, validating the journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details are excellent, with the "tired lung" of the room and "corners silvered" on boxes creating a palpable atmosphere. The use of dust patterns as a functional tool for discovery is a standout specific detail that grounds the abstract work in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are high (identity/erasure), but the opposition is largely passive (time/entropy), which lowers the immediate tension. The escalation relies on a montage of successes rather than a specific sharpening of a dilemma, though the brother's recognition provides a satisfying, if soft, peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "magnifying small kindnesses" resonates strongly without becoming overly saccharine. The parallel between the protagonist's "evidence" of love and the orphans' files is handled with emotional intelligence, avoiding a tidy cure for her grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the archival setting. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("fluent in bureaucratic omission") that creates distance, but the tone generally supports the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished but leans on adjectival clusters ("tactfully hopeful," "tired gleam") and repetition of the prompt verb "unfurl" (three times). The rhythm is generally good, though the summary sections lack the propulsion of the specific scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist healing the past is a familiar trope, but the specific angle of the emancipation law adds freshness. The execution is competent and moving, though it follows a somewhat expected trajectory for a sentimental drama.</comment>
