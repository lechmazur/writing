<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal sense of exposure is well-rendered, but characterization relies heavily on inserted labels ("watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive") rather than demonstrated action. The emotional shift is legible but feels slightly unearned due to the lack of on-page interpersonal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scene possesses a clear arc and legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the trajectory is linear and low-stakes. The resolution—planting moss as healing—feels inevitable rather than the result of a hard-won navigational choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the sterile data center and the organic moss is vivid and specific. The atmosphere effectively supports the mood, though some descriptions verge on being overly lush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily retrospective (the viral confession) rather than active in the scene. The on-page interaction lacks significant obstacles or difficult trade-offs; Mara accepts the invitation to plant without a meaningful test of her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("graft new meaning onto old wounds"), creating a "Thematic Echo" that flattens subtext. The result feels more like a stated moral than an earned resonance emerging from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the setting well. It maintains a stable POV, though the reliance on explanatory labels for emotions slightly distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is competent and often evocative, but suffers from awkwardly integrated prompt phrases (e.g., the long noun phrase "a pattern left by drip of...") and abstract telling ("protected vulnerability") that dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central image of the re-wilded data center is compelling, but the narrative execution follows a standard "healing garden" trope. The story plays it safe emotionally and structurally.</comment>
