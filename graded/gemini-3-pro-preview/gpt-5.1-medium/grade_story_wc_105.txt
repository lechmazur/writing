<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to engineer a solution for emotional fracture is compelling and drives the narrative specifically. Interiority is rich, though the climax relies on diagnostic self-analysis ("I realize I never heard only one sound... I heard two overlapping") rather than embodied reaction, which slightly distances the emotional beat. The final shift from preventing fracture to repairing it shows strong character growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the established goal to the prototype test and final adjustment. The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the goal from warning to repair. The logic of the "absences" and the device holds together well within the fantasy premise, delivering a satisfying structural turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "sunken orchard" and "ashen forge" actively shaping the acoustic and visual palette of the story. Details like "glass breathing out" and "ribs blooming rusted anemones" ground the fantastical elements in concrete sensory experience. The environment constrains the action and colors the protagonist's perception effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The internal stakes are high and clearly articulated, centering on the protagonist's unresolved trauma. The escalation is subtle but effective, moving from general collection to a specific, testing confrontation with the device. The resolution is earned through a change in perspective and a physical adjustment to the mechanism, though the external pressure is relatively low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of trust as a cycle of breaking and repair is poignant, supported by the "kintsugi" imagery of the lacquer. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thesis ("Maybe that is all trust ever was..."), which triggers the thematic echo penalty and flattens the resonance into a stated moral. Subtext is otherwise well-handled through the device's mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent synesthetic logic ("Blue sounds like glass breathing out") that defines the protagonist's worldview. The scientific-lyrical register ("careful calm of demolition") works well to bridge the engineering and emotional tracks. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the focus tight on the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with standout phrases like "careful calm of demolition" and "petals of metal." The density of figurative language is high ("leaking chemical light... like wounded dawn"), occasionally bordering on purple, but generally serves the synesthetic POV. Rhythm and flow support the contemplative pacing without dragging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "hearing aid for trust" set in a sunken greenhouse is highly original and imaginatively executed. The synthesis of audio engineering terms with emotional trauma creates a fresh metaphorical language. The story avoids generic tropes, offering a specific and memorable vision of memory and repair.</comment>
