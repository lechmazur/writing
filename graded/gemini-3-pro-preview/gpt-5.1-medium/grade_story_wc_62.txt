<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias possesses a distinct, meditative interiority that fits the story's tone, particularly in his reaction to the "mistake" butterfly. However, he functions primarily as a reactive vessel for the grandmother's instructions, lacking significant agency or difficult on-page choices until the final ritual. His motivation is clearly stated but feels abstract, driving a process rather than a high-stakes struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a summary montage ("So they began, night after night") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, which dissipates scene tension and compresses the timeline excessively for this length. The closure lands on a resonant image, but the impact is blunted by the explicit explanation of the metaphor in the final lines, removing the interpretive work required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like "glass bones of its roof tick" and the "slow river of color" anchoring the magical realism. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the transition between the greenhouse and the wider village/cemetery is somewhat fluid and less grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or obstacles, as the spectral mentorship provides a smooth path to the goal. The stakes are abstract ("discover the shape of collective grief") and the resolution is achieved through obedience to the ritual rather than overcoming a dramatic test or paying a visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central theme of collective grief is poignant but is ultimately delivered through a direct thesis statement ("In that moment he understood grief as a ribbon...") rather than emerging organically from the action. This explanatory ending flattens the subtext, converting a potentially resonant complex image into a simple moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, maintaining a "fiercely meditative" distance that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. The transition between the carver’s perspective and the broader omniscient observations is handled smoothly, though the tone risks becoming slightly monotonous in its reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("unfurled wings along the margin"), but occasionally dips into overwrought phrasing like "thundering calm" or wordy constructions ("fog that should not have been possible"). The rhythm is steady and supports the meditative pacing, though the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of mapping grief through a ribbon and hidden carvings is imaginative and visually arresting, offering a fresh take on the cemetery trope. However, the "ghost mentor teaching a lesson" structure is conventional, and the lack of narrative friction keeps the story in a safe, contemplative mode rather than risking a bolder narrative turn.</comment>
