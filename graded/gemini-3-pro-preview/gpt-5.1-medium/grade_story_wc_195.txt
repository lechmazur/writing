<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal pivot from performing "virtue" to recognizing it as mere "choreography" is excellent, grounding the abstract motivation ("capture the shape of possibility") in a felt psychological cost. The realization that his allegiance was to "the idea of being needed" rather than the king provides a specific, character-driven engine for the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, moving from a pseudo-mission to a conceptual confrontation and a clear decisive change. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the safety of the "script" is traded for the danger of the unpredicted, meeting the criteria for a resonant ending with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard" is realized with exquisite, functional specificity—"glass veins breathing frost," "masks carved from fogged crystal"—that actively constrains and guides the protagonist's realization. The setting acts as a crucible for the theme, elevating the score into the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The conflict is internalized but effectively externalized through Mira and the masks; the pressure scales coherently from the "late" arrival to the rejection of the masks. While the antagonist is distant, the immediate pressure on Calder's identity is sufficient to drive the stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The marionette motif serves as a potent thematic spine, evolving from a static image on the program to the dynamic "unsnapping" of the future at the close. The exploration of treason not as an act but as "confusion hardening" offers a sophisticated, non-binary take on the central question of loyalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like quality that suits the subject matter without slipping into abstraction. The lyrical distance is well-calibrated, allowing the high-concept dialogue ("factually mystical," "reality shifts") to land naturally within the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("ink bruised into violet dusk," "constellations as small, steady wounds"), maintaining momentum while carrying a heavy image load. The writing is polished and rhythmic, avoiding scaffold artifacts, though the high density of figurative language nears the ceiling for this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of alchemical steampunk aesthetics with a knight's existential crisis creates a distinct atmosphere. The resolution—choosing to be "unpredicted" rather than selecting a specific counter-role—adds a layer of ingenuity to the "rebel knight" trope.</comment>
