<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ilias is a compelling focalizer whose "tired precision" grounds the high-concept stakes in tactile labor. His contradictory impulses—protocol versus the desperate need to "harness the ephemeral"—drive a decisive action that feels strictly character-derived. The integration of grief as a professional motivator is handled with nuance, creating a seamless bond between internal state and external crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a clean Situational/Causal hybrid arc where the inciting incident (quake plus flare) immediately narrows options. The closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration; the "stolen clarity" reweights the struggle from mere survival to a legacy-defining victory. Causality is tight, with every technical move by Ilias responding directly to the escalating environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully active, functioning as both antagonist and tool; the "lantern nailed to the raw dark" is a striking orientation image. The environment physically constrains the protagonist's actions—forcing him to override locks while the floor rolls—satisfying the highest criteria for setting-as-pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated: the loss of the data is equated to existential failure ("only another crater"). The escalation is coherent, moving from alarms to the physical wrestling with the array. The cost is felt in the dangerous bypass of safeties and the physical toll of the quake, though a more permanent, irreversible sacrifice on the page would have secured a perfect score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of capturing the fleeting ("harness the ephemeral") is woven organically into the technical action, avoiding abstract sermonizing. The ending resonates powerfully, linking the stellar death to the human need for persistence without resolving into a simple moral, effectively repricing the concept of "escape velocity" as a survival of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is authoritative and lyrical ("sky was a slab of obsidian"), maintaining a consistent deep-third limited perspective. The modulation between technical jargon and poetic interiority is handled with high skill, creating a distinct perceptual signature that fits the "sage repairer" archetype perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("trembling like teeth in an old jaw"). The line-level craft supports the tension without becoming purple, maintaining momentum through the technical descriptions. The repetition of "changelessly constant" is noticeable but functions as a rhythmic anchor for the character's mindset.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Focusing on a repairer rather than a scientist offers a fresh, blue-collar entry point into a cosmic event, grounding the sublime in the mechanical. The specific synthesis of the "broken clock" and the "trembling star maps" creates a unique texture that elevates the standard "disaster on the moon" trope.</comment>
