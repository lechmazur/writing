<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tammuz is drawn with sharp, specific contradictions—a scientist using numbers as prayers—that fuel the narrative engine. His internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from rigid expectation to "usable doubt" feels earned by the on-page experiment. The "empirically ironic" trait is slightly expository, but his actions consistently dramatize this friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from a clear objective (the experiment) to a resonant, non-binary resolution. The callback to the "smudged note" risks feeling convenient, but it successfully anchors the closure in the protagonist’s personal history rather than external coincidence. The logic of the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is executed with precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "speculative museum" is a brilliant conceit that actively shapes the plot; Tammuz must manipulate the setting's infrastructure (floodlights) to enact his agency. The sensory details—dust, electrical hum, baked mud—are purposeful, grounding the metaphysical stakes in a tangible, decaying reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as existential and intellectual ("gambled their remaining years"), appropriate for the character. The tension of the alignment process is handled well, though the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric. The pressure builds effectively to the moment of the star's divergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted devotion"—finding the sacred in the schematic—is woven seamlessly through the action. The ending reframes the central question, offering a complex validation of doubt over the desired certainty, which resonates well with the "between regimes" motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the "astronomer-priest" archetype without slipping into melodrama. The close third-person POV effectively filters the environment through Tammuz's obsessive, quantifying lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control ("pleasure of data," "indifferent god"). Imagery is generally precise, though "beams rose like invisible columns" teeters on the edge of contradictory description given the dusty air. Overall, the line-level craft supports the story's high-concept ambition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian archaeology, astronomy, and a high-tech "speculative" museum feels fresh and distinct. Using floodlights to project a magic square onto the night sky is an ingenious visual and narrative device that creates a memorable, non-obvious scenario.</comment>
