<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal rigidity is well-dramatized through her interaction with the nursery, creating a clear character arc. Her backstory anchors her need for control, though the "shy part" interiority feels slightly distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from rigid control to surrender under the "Accumulative" lens. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, though the mechanism (touching the leaf triggering a vision) feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is exceptional, using the nursery environment ("misted panes," "waking roots") to tightly constrain Mara's emotional state. The setting actively charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the storm provides effective external pressure that mirrors the internal conflict. Escalation is present, though the final turn relies more on passive surrender than active confrontation, slightly softening the agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of resilience via surrender is developed well through imagery but is undercut by the final sentence, which explicitly summarizes the lesson ("teaching her how to..."), reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is atmospheric and consistent, fitting the reflective tone well. However, the verbatim repetition of the complex phrase "circuitously sincere" stands out as an unintegrated artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong and lyrical ("jeweled the wire"), but the repetition of "circuitously sincere" constitutes a loop artifact. The final sentence leans into expository summary, dampening the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "nature teaches the protagonist" concept is executed with high craft and specific detail. While not conceptually novel, the synthesis of the storm imagery with the internal spiral feels fresh.</comment>
