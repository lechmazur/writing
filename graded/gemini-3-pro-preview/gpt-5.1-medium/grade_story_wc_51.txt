<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to understand the angles that let pain loosen") is distinct and drives the ritualistic action. The internal conflict regarding their own erasure is successfully externalized through the magic system, and the resolution—a shift in stance rather than a removal of pain—demonstrates earned agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent "Situational" drive, building pressure through the accumulation of burdens toward a personal climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost is explicit ("no less burden"), creating a satisfying, non-trivial ending that validates the magic system's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "bronze grotto" is an exceptional setting that actively constrains the magic; the acoustics ("shingled hush") and tactile details ("wet coins," "metallic breath") create a dense, immersive atmosphere. The environment is not just a backdrop but a mechanical necessity for the fractal weaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the routine processing of others' pain to the immediate, crushing threat of the narrator's own existential fear. The resolution relies on a previously established skill ("orienting properly"), though the "rule I had carved" feels slightly convenient as a pivot point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of managing trauma through recontextualization is powerful and lands with emotional weight. However, the text occasionally leans into overt thesis statements ("burdens align or they devour," "weight could be steered") which slightly flatten the subtext into exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "mythic/lyrical" register that suits the subject matter perfectly. The "fractal weaver" persona feels lived-in, and the shift from professional detachment to personal vulnerability is handled with consistent control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and evocative ("gravel in marrow," "trembling shards"), with strong rhythmic control. The required phrase "boundary-lessly trapped" is clunky by nature but is integrated as a philosophical paradox, minimizing its disruption to the otherwise polished flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical concepts (fractals, geometry) with elemental magic (bone, fire, bronze) creates a fresh aesthetic for a sin-eater trope. The "shingled hush" is a particularly inventive concept for auditory pressure.</comment>
