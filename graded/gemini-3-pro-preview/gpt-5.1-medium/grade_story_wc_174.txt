<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator's arc from an "uncommonly serene" pose of detachment to a vulnerable admission of arrogance is compelling and earned by the scene's pressure. The internal contradiction between their "urbane" persona and the "dirty work" of the puppets drives the conflict effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scene transitions smoothly from the aftermath of the argument to the confrontation, with the backstory of the film festival tightly anchored to the present stakes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible emotional cost and clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is an active participant, its history of "tracking" and its acoustic "hush" thematically charging the present action. The spatial hierarchy of the mezzanine effectively dramatizes the status dynamic before the resolution collapses it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central stake—intellectual integrity vs. the exploitation of suffering—is made visceral through the students' confrontation. The escalation forces the narrator to abandon their safety rail and engage in a high-stakes vulnerability exercise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling is woven organically into the action, moving from abstract debate to a concrete demonstration of "reversed confession." The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead achieving a complex synthesis of shared doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, blending the "calligrapher's" precision with a darker, more cynical undertone. The shift in register during the perspective swap remains consistent with the character's established intellect and vulnerability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("ink dries fastest when people below are on fire"), though the metaphor of "glow worms of insight" leans slightly toward the ornamental. The rhythm effectively mirrors the "meteor hush" and the tension of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a radar dome setting, calligraphy, and subversive puppetry creates a fresh atmosphere for a workshop story. While the "perspective swap" is a known trope, it is revitalized here by the specific stakes and setting.</comment>
