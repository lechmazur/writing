<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional specificity; her grief is active, not passive, driving the conflict between stasis and utility. The transition from "holding a pause" to "opening the wood" is a earned psychological shift, rooted deeply in the established "hauntingly practical" character trait. The contradiction between feeling betrayal and seeking usefulness drives the scene to a resonant choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tightly controlled by the kettle’s boil, creating a natural, urgent window for the decision without artificial ticking clocks. Closure is definitive and lands with a Decisive Change (the cut) that conceptually reprices her grief from a wound to a tool. The orientation is immediate, and the causal chain from memory to action is unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is fully integrated into the psychological state; the "rain-beaded skylight" and the "ash blank" are not just scenery but active constraints that shape the protagonist's attention and choice. The sensory details—steam, sawdust smell, the tactile smoothness of the wood—ground the abstract emotion in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are beautifully internalized; the conflict is not just about carving wood, but about whether to preserve the dead in a static "pause" or transform memory into something living and useful. The cost—the feeling of betrayal in making him "furniture"—is articulated clearly on the page, making the final action carry significant weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a practical trade rather than a romanticized state is sophisticated and developed through concrete particulars. The story avoids simple platitudes, arriving at a complex resolution where "lessons from loss" means accepting utility over sanctity. The final image resonates powerfully with the core concept of "here and gone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blending the theatrical past with the quiet, gray present. The narrative distance is expertly managed, staying deep in Mara’s interiority while observing the external world with sharp clarity. The rhythm of the prose mirrors the "held breath" of the loft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with high information load and strong rhythmic control. The repetition of the prompt phrase "rain-beaded skylight" (three times) functions as a refrain, though the specific phrasing is slightly cumbersome; however, it anchors the setting effectively. The imagery is fresh, avoiding cliché even when dealing with rain and grief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (circus, grief) into a fresh configuration by focusing on the "practicality" of the lion tamer rather than the spectacle. The choice to center the conflict on a blank piece of ash wood provides a unique, tactile objective correlative for the emotional arc.</comment>
