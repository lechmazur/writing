<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s transition from a "defunct" revolutionary to a curator of lost possibilities is emotionally resonant and drives the plot. The relationship with Elyas effectively externalizes the thematic conflict, though the reaction of the "younger archivists" feels slightly stock. The final choice to internalize the revolution rather than fight openly earns the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from discovery to ideological dispute to a Conceptual Repricing closure that lands with distinct cost (the official history remains false). The inversion of the mirror-shrouding ritual at the end—keeping futures in rather than time out—is a masterful use of closure mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the "visible time" and baroque fortress constrain choices and enable the central metaphor. The specific interaction with the mirrors and the "storms of magnetic dust" grounds the abstract concept in tactile, actionable details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The intellectual stakes (history as tomb vs. rehearsal) are dramatized well through the archaeological dispute. While the Council acts as a somewhat abstract antagonist, the pressure it exerts forces a tangible change in Mara's tactics and worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "unused possibility" vs. "fatalism" is woven seamlessly into the plot mechanics and imagery without preaching. The resolution resists a tidy victory, offering instead a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of failed revolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent baroque/elegaic tone that suits the subject matter. The shift in perspective from the physical excavation to the metaphysical projection of poetry is handled with control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense, with strong imagery ("curtains pooled like spilled years"). However, a high frequency of "like [noun]" similes (8 instances) creates a slight pattern artifact that draws attention to the writing mechanics over the image in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "visible time" with a baroque, ceremonial asteroid fortress creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The inversion of the war-engine trope (engines as additions to a temple) adds genuine conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
