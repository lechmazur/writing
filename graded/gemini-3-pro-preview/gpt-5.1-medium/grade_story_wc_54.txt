<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct focalizer with a clear worldview ("listening to structures"), but she lacks internal contradiction or grit under pressure. The reference to "Grief 101" hints at depth that remains abstract and unpaid on the page; her motivation is intellectual rather than viscerally embodied, making her feel slightly more like a thematic vehicle than a person making difficult trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and successfully executes a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the building's state is meaningfully altered. While the logistics of rerouting commercial plumbing with only a headlamp and found tape are slightly convenient (lowering the causality score), the accumulation of effort and the final image land effectively under the situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, specific, and atmospheric, successfully blending the detritus of a carnival with the stark geometry of a spaceport ("ribs and bones"). The sensory details—plastic streamers, dust on candy wrappers—anchor the metaphor of abandonment physically, making the environment an active participant in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story relies on atmospheric pressure rather than urgent stakes or risk; Mira faces no opposition (guards, physical danger, time limits) other than the inertia of the building. While the internal goal is clear, the lack of a "tightening" beat where she must sacrifice something or face genuine failure limits the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection through redirected flow is integrated seamlessly into the action, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing at the end. The final image of the water system waiting to function serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's search for hope, though the explicit definition of hope in the opening is a bit directive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, filtering the world convincingly through an engineer's perspective ("stress in the joints," "gradients"). The POV remains stable, though the interiority sometimes drifts into slightly performative poetic reflection ("equations gone feral") rather than immediate, grounded thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is high-quality, lyrical, and dense with imagery ("quivering whenever the desert wind remembered them"). Sentence rhythm varies well, and the mechanical descriptions are elevated by the metaphorical lens without becoming confusing. A very strong technical execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of a carnival and a spaceport offers a fresh aesthetic, and the use of plumbing as a metaphor for hope is inventive. While the "fixer of broken places" trope is familiar, the specific execution through civil engineering details gives it a unique and memorable texture.</comment>
