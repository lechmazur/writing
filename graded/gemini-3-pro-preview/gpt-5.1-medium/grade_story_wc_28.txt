<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Laleh is a distinct archetype with a clear worldview, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Her conviction is absolute from start to finish, making her a static vehicle for the ritual rather than a character making difficult trade-offs under pressure. The motivation is stated ("cradle empathy") rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic logic holds together well, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing of the city's trauma. The "retrocognitive" loop provides a solid structure for the intervention. However, the progression is linear and somewhat inevitable; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or complications once the ritual begins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric detail is vivid and specific, effectively grounding the magical elements in sensory experience (smell of iron, heat of the tessera). The visual of the "minaret... hollow spine" and the "shattered sky" creates a strong, consistent mood that supports the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>External opposition is passive; the "people distrusted her" element is expository and does not manifest as an active obstacle in the scene. The stakes are high (healing the city), but the protagonist achieves her goal with relatively low friction, lacking a moment where failure seems possible or a tangible price is paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is integral but handled with heavy-handed didacticism. The narrative explicitly interprets itself for the reader ("telling the stone that the fire had been a teacher, not a tyrant"; "her rebellion was to refuse that scarcity"), which flattens the subtext and reduces the emotional resonance of the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the mythic quality of the story. The elevated diction is controlled, though it occasionally creates distance from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but overly reliant on simile scaffolds ("like iron," "like broken reeds," "like double exposure," "like a hook," "like soot"), creating a repetitive cadence. While the imagery is often beautiful, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum and borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "retrocognitive time trap" with a mosaic-based ritual healing is a fresh and imaginative concept. The subversion of the cyborg arm trope—using steel for empathy rather than violence—adds a unique conceptual layer.</comment>
