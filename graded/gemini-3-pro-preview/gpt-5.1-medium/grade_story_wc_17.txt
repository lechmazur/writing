<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific expertise and sensory interiority create a compelling, grounded perspective. The shift from professional detachment to personal stewardship is motivated by the discovery, though the sense of "kinship" with Mara feels slightly rushed to bridge the emotional gap. The final renunciation of the "simple commission" in favor of the burden demonstrates clear agency and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, layering sensory data until a pivot point is reached with the film strip. The closure is a strong example of Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to redrew the maps and stay fundamentally alters the character's trajectory. Causality is clean, moving logically from survey to discovery to decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active antagonist and partner that constrains the protagonist's methods (acoustics vs. sight). The sensory details—"air tasted like wet stone," "blistered brick"—are vivid and specific, directly charging the final image of listening to the walls dreaming. The atmosphere carries the weight of the narrative effortlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from a routine survey to a metaphysical obligation, supported by the quiet pressure of the "shifting weather." While the external threat is mild, the internal conflict regarding the "unfinished" work provides sufficient tension. The tightening occurs effectively when the film strip reveals the depth of the legacy, narrowing the protagonist's moral options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of stewardship is poignant, but the execution suffers from explicit labeling ("Legacy's burden pressed down," "questions that refused to fade"). This tendency to announce the theme rather than letting it emerge solely from the action prevents deeper subtextual resonance. The concept holds the story together, but the "telling" weakens the impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic for a "cartographer of echoes." The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world through the specific lens of acoustics and decay. The rhythm of the prose generally supports the contemplative tone, slipping only when forced to integrate specific prompt phrases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "petals touched by frost." However, the integration of the method prompt ("I knew the building wanted to speak through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace...") creates a visible seam, resulting in a clumsy, synthetic sentence that disrupts the otherwise polished flow. Without this artifact, the score would be significantly higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept of "echo cartography" in a climate-ruined world is a genuinely fresh synthesis that revitalizes the "found journal" trope. The approach to exploring ruins through sound rather than sight offers a distinct and memorable angle. The story takes a quiet risk by focusing on listening rather than action, which pays off in the mood.</comment>
