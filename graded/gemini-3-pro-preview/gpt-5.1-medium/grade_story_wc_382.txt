<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The relationship between the protagonist and the tutor serves as a strong crucible, driving the narrative efficiently. The pivot from theft to apprenticeship is slightly sudden but anchored well by the shared theme of "agreed upon lies." The ghost’s pedagogical patience provides a perfect foil to the protagonist’s eagerness, creating a distinct dynamic that sustains the short length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The two-shard structure (meeting and meteor shower) bridged by a summary transition fits the length perfectly, maintaining momentum. Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the "denials" of the building as a necessary condition of tenancy. The narrative arc creates a legible before/after state regarding the protagonist's perception of their home.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is the story’s strongest asset, acting as both subject and antagonist; the sensory details like "sea-green" lamps and "paper left too long in rain" are evocative and specific. The physical reality of the building—its joists, mortar, and fragility—directly charges the climax and final realization. The environment moves beyond backdrop to constrain choice and define the central mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes shift elegantly from the immediate (stealing sugar) to the conceptual (understanding the dangerous truth of the building). While the external conflict is low-key, the deepening pressure to "translate" creates sufficient narrative drive. The final cost—accepting the fragility of one's shelter—is a subtle but effectively felt price paid for the knowledge gained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "agreed upon lies" is tightly woven into both the premise (ghosts, tenancy) and the plot resolution. The story avoids preachy moralizing, instead offering a complex insight into how we inhabit decaying spaces and narratives. The ending reweights the earlier motif of borrowing/lying into a survival strategy, achieving high resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and attuned to the magical realist tone, managing the balance between the mundane and the supernatural well. The narrative distance remains stable, allowing the reader to share the protagonist’s shift in perception. The tone of "mysterious familiarity" is sustained without slipping into generic wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A few metaphors border on precious (e.g., meteors as "punctuation marks"), but the overall control is high. The visual precision of the climax—the seal's symbols rearranging—demonstrates strong line-level craft without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with an architectural/linguistic mystery is fresh and engaging. Using a "dead language" metaphor for the sounds of settling buildings provides a unique lens on a familiar setting. The specific mechanism of the meteor shower and seal adds a distinct, imaginative layer to the resolution.</comment>
