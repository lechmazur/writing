<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle between the safety of neutrality and the risk of participation is effectively dramatized through the interaction with the swan. While the character functions somewhat as a mythic archetype, the specific trait of "gripping reality loosely" provides a grounded mechanism for his acceptance of the surreal shift, creating a cohesive emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative structure is distinct and controlled, moving cleanly from stasis to intrusion to a decisive reconfiguration. The closure is excellent: the protagonist's choice to step into the current creates a legible "after" state where his relationship to knowledge is fundamentally altered, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration standard with clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant in the story rather than a backdrop; the library's roots and the obsidian refuge physically constrain and guide the narrative. The transformation of the room into the river refuge is vivid and meaningful, serving as the external manifestation of the protagonist's internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily philosophical—observation vs. engagement—but is made urgent through the physical encroachment of the swan and the roots. The escalation is steady, and the final choice carries a tangible price: the abandonment of his "vantage of neutrality" and the exposure of the hidden library.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of history as a living, changing force rather than a static record is woven seamlessly into the imagery of roots, paper, and water. The ending, which inverts the keeper's position (bringing the library to light while he remains in the deep), offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic timbre that suits the subject matter perfectly. The psychic distance is well-calibrated, allowing the surreal transitions to feel grounded in the protagonist's specific mode of perception without slipping into confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and rich, with strong rhythm and high information density. However, the density of figurative language (e.g., "echo tattooed beneath skin," "silence... inhaling courage") occasionally borders on overwriting, and the use of "via" in the description of the swan strikes a slight register dissonance with the otherwise timeless tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of reading an origami swan by touch to rearrange reality is a fresh and striking image. The synthesis of familiar library tropes with the dynamic, paper-generating river creates a unique and memorable vision that feels specific to this story.</comment>
