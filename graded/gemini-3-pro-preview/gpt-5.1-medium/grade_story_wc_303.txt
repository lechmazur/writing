<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is sharply defined, balancing professional obligation against a magical/moral imperative. The protagonist’s internal conflict is embodied viscerally ("volume hurt," "blood in my ears"), and the final refusal is an active choice that accepts the cost of the empire's displeasure, earning the high grade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is excellent: a Decisive Change (refusal to sign) coupled with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the violin cracking). The Causal lens holds firmly as the protagonist's decision precipitates the object's reaction. The narrative arc from the plant's warning to the coffee's confirmation to the act of writing is tight and logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is not just backdrop but an active pressure; the humidity and "velvet swallowing echoes" heighten the tension. The "stone plinth sweating" and the "midsummer stars" create a tangible atmosphere that directly charges the violin's final reaction, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated (truth vs. imperial grant) and escalate effectively through the plant's warning and Aurelio's pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives the deepening—choosing to write "detailed doubts" rather than merely walking away—crystallizing a stance with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of truth resisting imperial narrative is strong, but the protagonist's dialogue ("truth will not stand still for your banners") explicitly states the thesis, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. This slight didacticism prevents a higher score despite the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the "provenance researcher" persona. The perspective remains stable. A slight distance created by the density of the metaphor prevents the highest band, but the control is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with striking imagery ("contract folded like a paper guillotine"). However, the metaphor density is high, and "black as eclipse residue" reads as a slight figurative muddle amidst otherwise precise language. The rhythm and momentum are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of provenance research with plant telepathy and coffee divination is fresh and specific. The concept of an "annotated" reality where nature rebels against imperial history feels inventive and is executed with high conceptual integrity.</comment>
