<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling, introspective narrator with a clear internal conflict (closure vs. reopening). However, the external dialogue from the plants functions as "therapeutic mirrors," articulating her subconscious flaws ("You are built like a key, not a lock") with diagnostic precision. This externalizes the theme too conveniently, telling the reader the character's arc rather than letting her discover it through friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a cohesive vignette with a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end, shifting the goal from silence to witnessing. The transition from the surgery's failure to the coffee-ring epiphany is distinct and legible. The pacing works for a contemplative piece, though it relies on a static "talking heads" dynamic where the heads are hallucinations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting blends clinical sterility ("starch and antiseptic") with surreal fantasy ("ivy braided along the window") effectively. Specific props like the sweating coffee cup and the glowing hourglass ground the scene. The "tower" remains slightly vague in its physical reality—hospital or ruin?—but this ambiguity suits the dreamlike post-anesthesia tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily philosophical; there is low immediate danger, as the protagonist accepts the hallucinations relatively quickly. The pressure comes from the plants challenging her worldview, leading to a deepening of perception rather than a high-cost external choice. The shift from resisting the voices to reading the coffee ring provides the necessary narrative movement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "reading scars" versus "closing wounds" is resonant and beautifully crystallized in the final "astronomer" metaphor. The ending feels earned and conceptually rich. The only drawback is the "Thematic Echo" in the plant dialogue, which states the thesis explicitly ("You want closure... but you are built like a key") rather than letting it emerge solely from the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and distinct, maintaining a high-quality perceptual signature ("gossipers," "rustling consonants"). The shift between clinical observation and poetic epiphany is handled smoothly. The "we" of the ivy and the singular "I" of Mara create a nice vocal texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("smell of rain trapped in cloth," "crater seen from orbit"). The recurring "meteor hush" frame provides structural elegance. Sentence rhythm is varied and propulsive, with no significant loop artifacts or scaffold phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical trauma, telepathic botany, and divination is fresh and imaginatively executed. Re-framing the "miracle" as a displaced ability to read history in scars elevates the premise above a standard "failed experiment" trope.</comment>
