<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by high competence and sensory attunement, fitting the mythic mode. However, he lacks internal conflict or a difficult choice under pressure; his actions are procedural enactments of skill rather than decisions with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, linear ritual execution that successfully lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the quiet established). The closure is distinct and earned through the established magic system, though the "cost" remains largely abstract (exertion/focus) rather than a tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and functions as the physics of the story; sound and geology are entwined beautifully. The "veined curtain of ice" and "spiral of spores" are distinct, grounded details that anchor the metaphysical conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The external pressure (storm/energy beings) is established well, but the protagonist's safety never feels truly threatened due to his "assurance." The conflict is resolved through mastery rather than a desperate trade-off or hard tactical pivot, limiting narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of forging silence against "volume mistaken for presence" is woven tightly into the action. The final image of the bloom opening inward perfectly crystallizes the central thematic argument without needing exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the mythic subject matter. The transition from external observation to internal sensory processing ("marrow ring") is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong images like "rain carried voices that never quite learned how to be rain." Minor clichés ("bruised, exhausted sky") and abstract logic ("mapping grammar against heart") prevent a higher score, but the rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology, acoustics, and a sci-fi antagonist ("energy beings") creates a fresh aesthetic. While the "guardian of old ways" archetype is familiar, the specific mechanics of the ice and echo stone add genuine novelty.</comment>
