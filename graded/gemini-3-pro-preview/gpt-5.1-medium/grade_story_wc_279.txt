<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lark is a vividly drawn protagonist whose internal conflict—whimsy versus sacred weight—resolves through a credible, high-cost realization about her art's power. The "socially perceptive" trait is integrated well to drive the climax, though the secondary character (the boy) functions more as a prop for Lark's epiphany than a fully realized presence. The shift from "sidewalk dragons" to the frightening responsibility of "outlining chaos" is a strong, character-specific arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving efficiently from the sensory setup to the inciting discovery of the tile and the climatic breach of silence. Closure is excellent, delivering a Conceptual Repricing where Lark loses the safety of "harmless" art. The "unlearning" ritual provides effective structural pressure that forces the protagonist's hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and active; the "dripping stone" and "sour bell" create a tangible atmosphere that pressures the protagonist. The "whispering gallery tile flake" serves as a brilliant micro-setting element that bridges the physical environment and the plot's central conflict. The sensory details are purposeful, reinforcing the theme of captured sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pressure of the "emergent hush" creates a clear, escalating cost for Lark's intervention, making the act of speaking a significant risk. While the boy's confession ("Losing my brother") is slightly generic, the structural conflict between the ritual's demand for erasure and Lark's compulsion to record is handled with precision. The climax feels earned and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus erasure is woven beautifully through the mandala metaphor, culminating in a resonant insight about "outlining the mess." While the epiphany is explicitly stated near the end ("the mess was not to be erased but outlined"), it is grounded in the visual language of the story and carries a felt cost (loss of innocence), avoiding a preachy tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, filtering the world through an artist's synesthetic perception ("chalks sweated," "lilac unease"). The prose rhythm matches the tension of the ritual, and the shift from observation to action is handled without breaking the established POV distance. The internal monologue feels authentic to the specific character archetype.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality verbs ("oxidize," "gnawed") driving the imagery. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("gentle, lilac unease"), but the overall control is high-band. The line-level craft successfully supports the magical realism of the premise without becoming opaque.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "whispering gallery" where tiles physically catch secrets is a fresh and engaging fantasy conceit. Juxtaposing a whimsical sidewalk artist with a solemn, erasure-focused ritual creates a novel friction that elevates the story beyond a standard "magical object" tale. The synthesis of elements feels organic and specific.</comment>
