<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eren is a strongly realized protagonist with a specific, distinct worldview ("asked not just where someone died but what they had almost said"). His motivation is woven into his actions, and the choice to break protocol is well-supported by established traits. He borders on idealized—lacking a gritty internal flaw or hesitation that would heighten the personal stakes—but the execution is consistent and empathetic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, effective causal chain from the initial signal to the final delivery. The inciting incident (the tick) and the climax (the phone call) are distinct and impactful. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the emotional reality for the characters, though the cost to Eren is relatively low (emotional expenditure rather than tangible loss).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is high, with excellent sensory details like the "smell of boiled cabbage and laundry soap" and the "cracked plastic oracle." The hearing aid functions brilliantly as a micro-setting/tool that constrains and guides the scene. The environment feels lived-in and tangibly pressures the protagonist's mood and pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conflict is coherent but low-pressure; the antagonist is essentially entropy and silence rather than an active force. While the emotional stakes escalate nicely (from a blip to a profound message of forgiveness), the lack of significant external obstacles or a higher personal cost for Eren keeps the tension in the middle bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of connection across the veil is handled with sensitivity and grace. However, the final sentence ("He named this quiet work incidental heroism") explicitly labels the theme, converting subtext into text. This didactic summation flattens the resonance of the preceding image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent melancholic and lyrical texture ("mist smeared the glass," "bruise-purple"). The tone matches the subject matter perfectly, and the prose rhythm supports the pacing of the investigation. The focus remains tightly anchored in Eren’s perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and evocative, but suffers from repetitive diction ("persistently curious," "persistent tick," "mist-clad," "mist smeared," "mist-wrapped"). While the imagery is strong, the density of adjectives and the echoing of root words across short distances create a slight drag on the reading flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "ghost detective" is a familiar trope, but the specific technological interface (the hearing aid hunting echoes) and the bureaucratic framing ("contact tracer for hearts") add a fresh, specific layer. The story executes the premise with emotional intelligence, elevating it beyond a standard genre piece.</comment>
