<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is highly specific and grounded in the protagonist's dual role as lantern lighter and observer of the town's decay. The motivation to understand the memory loss is clear and compelling, transitioning effectively from observation to the active ritual at the climax. The connection between the father's lore and the current crisis adds earned depth to the protagonist's competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an Accumulative lens, gathering density from the failing lanterns to the final experiment. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the invisible mechanics of the world are made visible with a felt physical cost ("chest filled with wet sand"). Orientation is precise, anchoring the surreal events in a tangible geography.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific interplay between the harbor, the whale's "gravity," and the salt crystal chamber drives the story's logic. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("gleaming silence," "sour souring"), and the environment actively constrains the protagonist's movement and perception, satisfying the 9+ criterion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the initial omen of failing lights to the disturbing erasure of time and memory. The stakes are existential but grounded in the immediate community, and the protagonist's choice to confront the anomaly leads to a deepening of understanding rather than a simple fix. The cost is palpable in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory having physical weight and gravity is executed with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed exposition. The metaphor of the "house whose door no longer matches its frame" is brilliantly chosen, and the ending resonates by validating the father's worldview without reducing the mystery to a simple moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "gleaming silence" tone that perfectly suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing for intimate observation of the town's unraveling while maintaining the protagonist's slightly detached, analytical perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with no visible scaffolding or loops. Imagery is fresh and functional ("taper kissed a wick," "stunned fish"), and the rhythmic control supports the building tension. The circular framing of the "gleaming silence" adds a layer of structural elegance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a beached whale, gravitational anomalies, salt crystal farming, and coffee-ground divination is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The story takes a fresh angle on the trope of memory loss by giving it a specific physical physics, satisfying the requirements for high-band ingenuity.</comment>
