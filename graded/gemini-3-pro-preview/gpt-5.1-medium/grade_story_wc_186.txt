<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—to prove the metaphysical weight of coincidence—is distinct and compels him to physical extremes, elevating a standard survival task into a philosophical quest. His retrocognitive ability is treated not as a superpower but as a burdened perspective that deepens his isolation, and the final realization of his own voice closes his arc with profound, character-specific resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While the arrival of the comet is a coincidence, the plot earns this turn by explicitly framing the protagonist's goal as an attempt to validate coincidence itself. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "shard of hush" breaks to reveal a past plea—lands with clear conceptual clarity and emotional cost, satisfying the situational drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "glass humming pavilion" and "pedestal of fused bone" create a tactile, vibrating environment that acts as a pressure cooker for the narrative. The sensory details are highly specific and functional, with elements like the "radio ghosts" and the "salt flower" grounding the abstract concepts of the hush and retrocognition in a lived-in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict between the protagonist's search for pattern and the "twitching of a dead universe" is escalated effectively by the tangible decay of his resources and body. The pressure is coherent and builds to a decisive action, where the cost is the destruction of the silence (the hush) to gain a fleeting, fragile connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story integrates the prompt's required tone into a sophisticated exploration of memory and recurrence, meeting the 9+ standard for a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The ending reframes the protagonist's isolation not as a failure, but as a closed loop of self-care, proving that the pattern he sought was internal all along.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is assured and atmospherically dense, successfully balancing high-concept sci-fi elements with a mythic, lyrical register. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through the protagonist's unique retrocognitive lens without resorting to heavy-handed exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is rich and precise, with high information density in lines like "preserved like an insect in ambered quiet." The imagery is consistently evocative, driving the narrative momentum without stalling in static description, though a few phrases skirt the edge of being ornate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition with the mechanics of a lighthouse creates a fresh, specific magic system that transforms a familiar post-apocalyptic trope. The concept of "hush" as a physical substance trapped in a prism is particularly inventive and emotionally potent.</comment>
