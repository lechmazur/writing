<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tomas is a deeply realized focalizer; his "precisely humane attention" coheres perfectly with his grief and professional duty. The internal shift from guarding structures to guarding stories is earned through specific sensory interactions with the debris, making the emotional arc feel authentic and inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative drive—following the trail of photos—transitions smoothly into a causal realization. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "levee" metaphor effectively shifts from a physical wall to a communal act of listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, acting as both antagonist and catalyst; details like the "thin bruise" of twilight and the "sucking" mud create a palpable, immersive atmosphere. The emerging town is described with specific, haunting imagery that grounds the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a private struggle with grief to a public choice about preservation versus erasure. The arrival of the neighbors at the climax provides necessary external pressure, forcing Tomas to crystallize his stance immediately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure is woven effortlessly into the narrative action rather than stated abstractly. The final image reconfigures the story's central symbol (the levee) into a human/social structure, offering deep thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic control that suits the protagonist's "vigilant" character. The shift from observation to action is handled without breaking the established rhythmic restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative ("mirrored hush," "furred with algae"), though the opening "midnight ridgeway at twilight" creates a jarring temporal contradiction. Occasional metaphors ("gray fingers") lean toward cliché, but the overall texture is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a resurfacing town is familiar, but the specific angle of the levee warden turning from structural engineer to storyteller offers a fresh, poignant synthesis. The execution elevates the trope through character specificity.</comment>
