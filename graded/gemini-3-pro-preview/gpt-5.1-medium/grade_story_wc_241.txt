<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct, filtering the world effectively through her probability-focused lens ("time had split," "chased impossible odds"). The tension between her cautious nature ("design safety nets") and the final risk she takes in the hospital is a strong character arc. However, her core motivation ("widen perspectives responsibly") feels slightly expository and told rather than purely dramatized until the final beat. The father’s characterization is vivid, though his transition to "counting breaths" relies on summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is emotionally coherent, moving from avoidance to engagement, but the central plot device creates a severe logic break. Finding a candle burning in a library archive ("an antique fire hazard") left by a man who has been hospitalized for hours (or days) is chronologically and physically impossible without a "magical" explanation that contradicts the story's grounded realism. This causal gap in the inciting incident undermines the otherwise strong closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is excellent, with specific sensory choices like "wet wool," "printer ink," and "crushed clover" grounding the scene. The metaphor of the library as a "ship in thick fog" is evocative. However, the score is capped by the plausibility failure of the burning candle in a public archive; while acknowledged as a "fire hazard," its presence breaks the rules of the established realistic setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The internal stakes (fear of loss vs. need for control) are well-calibrated and escalate naturally through the journey to the hospital. The contrast between the father's gambling and the daughter's probability models provides a solid framework for the conflict. The final beat—writing the note—is a meaningful micro-turn that resolves the tension by bridging their differing philosophies with a shared action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of probability versus destiny is cohesive, but the execution relies heavily on explicit text artifacts (the note, the graffiti) to articulate the thesis. Phrases like "Everything is rigged, but the feelings are real" lean toward aphorism rather than subtext. The resonance is strong, but the delivery feels slightly arranged, with the world speaking the theme too directly to the protagonist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the protagonist's intellectual background. Metaphors like "numeric readouts... like bad lecture notes" and "windows filmed over... smeared comets" align perfectly with her character. The voice maintains control even during emotional reflection, avoiding melodrama while conveying depth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose quality is high, with dense imagery and rhythmic variance ("stunned gray of late November," "ink feathered like little ferns"). The writing is polished and avoids major artifacts. A few phrasings are slightly overwrought ("words catching like chips between teeth"), but overall the line-level craft supports the literary tone effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a rational scientist daughter and a gambler father is a familiar trope, but the specific execution via the "lantern trick" and subway divination adds freshness. The story synthesizes these elements well, though the heavy reliance on the convenient discovery of the note prevents higher scores for ingenuity.</comment>
