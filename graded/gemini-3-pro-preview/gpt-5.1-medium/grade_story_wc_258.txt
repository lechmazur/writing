<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is well-rendered through the lens of her ritual, establishing a distinct worldview. However, the dialogue often serves as a vehicle for thesis statements rather than character revelation, making the interaction feel slightly staged rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from a solitary ritual to a shared reconfiguration of the future. The ending lands a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, creating a legible "before and after" regarding their stance on the collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are excellent, particularly the "cables dangled like ivy" and the rain like "cautious comets." The measuring tape functions as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the physical and conceptual space of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily conceptual—defining a new mode of living post-collapse—which fits the quiet tone. The escalation is gentle, deepening intimacy rather than ratcheting external pressure, though the cost of abandoning "vertical" hope is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of lateral vs. vertical growth is poignant but heavily over-articulated in dialogue ("We built vertical empires again..."). This explicit moralizing triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, as characters explain the subtext to each other.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled ("questions like spare batteries"), creating a strong mood. However, the dialogue register is overly formal and expository for an intimate moment, reducing the sense of naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("scarred wooden floorboards," "onyx-ink sigil"). Rhythm is well-managed, though some phrasing feels slightly self-conscious or writerly in its precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, cryptocurrency aftermath, and measuring tools creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The "sideways" growth concept is a recognizable post-growth trope but is executed here with original imagery.</comment>
