<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation—"trespassing on memory for want of a stage"—is immediately compelling and anchors the surreal premise in grounded human need. The internal shift from skepticism to artistic communion is earned through concrete sensory interactions with the score, culminating in a credible, embodied choice to play.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a flawless Accumulative arc, transitioning from atmospheric observation to active decoding and finally to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ruin into a performance space. The closure is distinct and earned, reweighting the initial trespass into an act of artistic rebellion with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting functions as an active antagonist and collaborator; the "patient tide" and "swollen leaf" program constrain movement and dictate the plot's central mechanic. Sensory details are precise and transformative, turning the flooded pit into a "sunken cathedral" that actively shapes the musician's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tension escalates effectively from the physical pressure of the "icy" water to the intellectual stakes of deciphering the ghost's code. The deepening is marked by the protagonist's transition from "pretending" to engaging, though the stakes remain largely internal and atmospheric rather than externally urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of persistence and "mutiny bloom[ing] inside silence" emerges organically from the mechanics of the water-damaged score rather than exposition. The concept of the "pauses" as political refusal is a sophisticated, earned insight that charges the final image with profound subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and consistently filtered through the musician’s specific expertise (intervals, downbeats, resolution). The tone balances the eerie "sunken cathedral" atmosphere with technical precision, maintaining strong control over psychic distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with verbs doing heavy lifting ("pooled," "carved," "snag on silence"). Figurative language is fresh and cohesive ("planets around a drowned sun"), driving momentum without lapsing into purple prose or static description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—interpreting water damage as a musical score composed of "blots" and "ruin"—is a highly original synthesis of setting and action. The execution avoids standard ghost story tropes in favor of a unique interaction between the artist and the decay of his medium.</comment>
