<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora is a compelling focalizer whose internal contradiction—official embroiderer vs. secret listener—drives the narrative logic. The "foolishness" disguise is dramatized effectively through the pricked finger, establishing her control over the status dynamic. Her final choice to offer a map of absence is perfectly aligned with her established motivation to preserve unheard stories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with the prince's arrival serving as a clear inciting incident that tests Liora's vocation. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: the "void" on the map reconfigures the prince's strategy from conquest to erasure, carrying a distinct conceptual cost. The causality is uninterrupted, though the candle's lie-detection mechanic feels slightly convenient as a shortcut for tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the observatory, the specific tools (needles, indigo cloth), and the "eternal flame" constrain and shape the scene's physical reality. The sensory details—frost like fingerprints, the smell of horse and ink—ground the high-concept premise in tactile specificity. The environment actively charges the final image of the stitched void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established with the looming coup, and pressure escalates as the prince demands a chart that defies standard navigation. The conflict is resolved through agency, with Liora refusing a binary choice in favor of a "ghost" path. While the dialogue carries the weight well, the external pressure remains somewhat static outside the conversation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "unheard stories" and the power of erasure resonates strongly through the plot and imagery. The subtext in the dialogue ("I only mend what others tear") adds depth without exposition. The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex thematic synthesis about the danger and necessity of becoming invisible to history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending lyrical observation with sharp political insight ("power moved not in straight lines"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Liora's perception, filtering the prince's actions through her specific expertise. The tone is consistent, though the "echoed silence" motif is a touch oxymoronic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric, with high information density and strong rhythm ("boots scraping stone"). Metaphors are generally effective ("shadow... like an eclipse that refused to leave"), though occasionally dense. The line-level craft successfully supports the magical realism tone without drifting into purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, and espionage offers a fresh, specific take on the "oracle advisor" trope. The concept of mapping "adjacent possibilities" via stitching provides a unique mechanism for the plot. The resolution feels inevitable yet surprising, elevating the premise beyond a standard fantasy vignette.</comment>
