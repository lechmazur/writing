<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling, distinct focalizer with a clearly dramatized motivation rooted in specific backstory (the brother). While her competence is high and her internal landscape vivid, the scene lacks a moment where she is forced to make a difficult trade-off or overcome genuine internal resistance, limiting the depth of the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure—shifting the gorge's song from grief to humor—is legible. However, the progression is linear and the resolution feels slightly too efficient; the "fix" works on the first try without a complication that forces a tactical shift, reducing the weight of the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is established with strong, specific sensory details, particularly the auditory imagery of the gorge and the visual of the harp embedded in stone. The environment actively constrains the interaction, serving as both setting and antagonist, though the "temperature of memory" line reads a bit abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (restoring joy), but the opposition yields too easily; the ghosts comply with the invitation to laugh almost immediately, lacking a beat of struggle or rejection. Consequently, the victory feels low-cost, as the protagonist encounters minimal resistance from the forces she confronts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of integrating humor into grief is handled with sophistication, avoiding platitudes by using specific, absurd confessions (the dentures, the river monster lie). The ending resonates well with the premise, offering a specific emotional shift rather than a generic moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the subject matter ("modestly fearless," "language of unfinished goodbyes"). The distance is well-managed, keeping us close to Mara's perceptions, though the tone occasionally risks becoming too uniform in its solemnity until the dialogue breaks it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and imagery ("layered so tightly that sorrow and giggle were indistinguishable"). However, it occasionally tips into overwriting with stacked metaphors ("bruised harmonies," "luminous ache") and abstract phrasing that distances the reader slightly from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "stand-up comedy exorcism"—healing the dead through absurdity rather than solemn prayer—is a fresh and inventive synthesis. The execution avoids standard ghost story tropes, grounding the magic in specific, tactile elements like the riverweed harp strings.</comment>
