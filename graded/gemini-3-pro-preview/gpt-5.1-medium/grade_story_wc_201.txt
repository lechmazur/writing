<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from victim to participant is powerfully charted through the reclamation of the "brace." The shift from an imposed reflex to a chosen angle ("brace was mine... preparatory") provides a distinct moment of agency that earns the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structure is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the disorientation of waking to the clarity of the final choice. The progression feels inevitable under the Situational lens, with the forest guiding the survivor to the machine without wasted motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting functions brilliantly as an interface rather than scenery, actively translating the character's internal scars into external geometry. This integration of environment and backstory constrains navigation and directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are visceral and high, pitting the autonomy of the self against the potential utility of suffering. The escalation is internal but forceful, leading to a horrifying yet earned consensus between the survivor and the experiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "mathematics of mercy" is a profound thematic engine that avoids simple moralizing, exploring the quantification of pain with rigorous consistency. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, effectively repricing the trauma as "data."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is highly distinct, merging clinical detachment ("systematic disassembly") with poetic trauma-response ("tasted of copper"). The narrative distance is controlled perfectly, allowing the surreal elements to feel grounded in the character's specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("discarded question mark"). However, the repetition of the polysyllabic phrase "proprioceptively enhanced" feels slightly clunky, and the density of metaphor occasionally threatens to obscure the physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of torture survivor narrative and sci-fi abstraction. The concept of the forest as a bio-feedback interface for trauma is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity, avoiding standard tropes.</comment>
