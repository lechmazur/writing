<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s internal landscape is vivid, defined by a compelling professional melancholia and the "stone in the shoe" motivation. The choice to protect the secret at the end ("closed the interface") is a strong character beat that respects the autonomy of the missing, shifting the protagonist from investigator to guardian. The voice remains consistent, though the connection to Ora relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized past interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear, moving from the inciting observation of "713" to the resolution in the subnet. However, the climax relies on a soft sci-fi trope where a poetic query ("treating silence as content") yields hard data coordinates, which weakens the mechanical causality of the solution. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's understanding of "deletion" with the felt cost of complicit silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, blending corporate sterility with quasi-religious imagery ("humming cathedral," "chilled racks") to create a cohesive atmosphere. The concept of the "memorial garden" and "Deep Cold" grounds the digital environment in tangible, spatial terms. This specificity elevates the "ghost in the machine" premise significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are personal (the need for truth) versus professional (compliance/deletion), escalating cleanly from passive observation to active transgression (spoofing the audit). While the external antagonist (the system) is passive, the internal pressure to solve the "cold case" drives momentum effectively. The resolution satisfies the dominant stake by uncovering the truth, even if the external status quo remains unchanged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "deletion as escape" is integrated seamlessly into the plot and setting, challenging the corporate narrative of "erasure." The subtext regarding autonomy in a surveillance state resonates powerfully without becoming preachy. The ending reinforces this by framing the "buried subnet" not as a glitch, but as a sanctuary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the "memory keeper" persona. The tone manages to be both clinical and elegiac ("RESOLVED... is a lie we tell regulators"). The pacing is measured, allowing the mystery to unfold with a gravity that matches the protagonist's internal burden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("black square of time," "threadbare orbit"). There is a slight tendency toward preciousness in metaphors like "braided the clue," but the rhythm is generally excellent. The integration of required phrases is smooth, avoiding the awkwardness often seen in constraint-based writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the execution is stylish, the core premise of "consciousness uploaded/hiding in the network" is a familiar cyberpunk trope. The story differentiates itself through its specific atmospheric focus and the "corporate archeology" angle, but the underlying concept does not break significant new ground.</comment>
