<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara has clear agency and a coherent motivation, but her internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses required for higher bands; she acts more as a fable archetype than a conflicted individual. The "hourglass turner" title functions as a label rather than an integrated trait, as it implies skills or history that do not influence the scene or tactics. The emotional shift is stated ("suddenly certain") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows a clean causal line with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the release of the echo conceptually reweights the world. The mechanics of the button map are accepted under the story's fable logic, though the progression from entry to discovery feels linear and low-resistance. The orientation is solid, establishing the warehouse and its rules effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s standout strength, with specific sensory details like "dust floated like slow constellations" and "trapped sunsets" creating a vivid, tactile environment. The warehouse setting and the specific objects (buttons, amber) actively constrain the protagonist's method, satisfying the requirements for a high score. The interplay between the silence of the cliffs and the visual clutter of the warehouse is excellent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptually high (order vs. possibility) but lack immediate visceral pressure; the absence of an active antagonist or tight time constraint lowers the tension. The narrative relies on the internal weight of the decision rather than external obstacles, as the guards "trusted the cliffs," removing the threat of discovery. The climax is a choice, but the cost feels abstract rather than felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The central theme of multiplicity versus ordered silence is coherent and woven through the imagery of the echo and buttons. However, the score is capped by the explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph ("Shared wisdom... was the courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own"), which explains the subtext rather than trusting the final image to resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like tone, handling the magical realism with confidence. Narrative distance is controlled, though the insertion of the phrase "as the truth unravels" creates a jarring tense shift that momentarily disrupts the smooth narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with high image density and good rhythm, avoiding major loops or scaffolding. The score is held back by the awkward grammatical integration of the required phrase "as the truth unravels," which clashes with the established past tense ("rehearsed... as the truth unravels").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of mapping a warehouse via lost buttons is a fresh, specific invention that elevates the otherwise familiar trope of a captured voice. The synthesis of the "humming cliffs" and the "amber warehouse" creates a distinct aesthetic identity that feels original and memorable.</comment>
