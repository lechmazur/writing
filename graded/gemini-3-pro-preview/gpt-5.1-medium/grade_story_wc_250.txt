<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dentist's internal conflict is embodied well through the "broken teeth" metaphor and the use of the mirror. The Guardian's mythic patience provides a strong counterpoint. The dentist's nervous behavior with the shutters is slightly contrived physically but serves the fable-like logic effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and earned; the phone call breaks the stasis with visible emotional cost. The causal link between the Guardian's water-weaving and the dentist's courage is handled through a satisfying poetic logic that bridges the two locations without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable, with "bruised glass" and the "cobalt dock" setting the tone. The dental mirror functions brilliantly as a micro-setting and tool, connecting the professional failure to the immediate physical setting of the dock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but felt; the tension between silence and speech is well-escalated by the interplay of light. The resolution feels earned by the dentist's willingness to engage with the "constellations" and finally speak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "silent empathy" is not just stated but dramatized through the mechanics of the plot (reflection and water). The "value of stars" motif resolves beautifully in the final image without becoming overly moralistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the fable mode. While the focus shifts frequently between the dock and the room, the cinematic cross-cutting works well to establish the connection between the two isolated figures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative; "shutters clacked like teeth" is a standout image that links character to action. The required phrase "spiralingly calm" is woven in smoothly despite its awkward nature, and the rhythm supports the water imagery throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The combination of a canal guardian fable with a dentist's professional guilt is highly original. The use of the dental mirror to reflect starlight is a fresh, specific, and ingenious device that grounds the magic in the character's reality.</comment>
