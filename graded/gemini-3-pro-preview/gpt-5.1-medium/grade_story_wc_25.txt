<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Milo is a static archetype of competence who faces no internal friction or doubt; his "wizardry" solves the external problem immediately without requiring a difficult choice, sacrifice, or exposure of a flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a magical solution (the key) that bypasses logical causality to resolve the central problem. The closure offers a tidy, symmetric victory without the required visible or felt cost, failing the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth is evocative and spatially distinct, providing a strong atmospheric backdrop. The sensory details of the storm and the metallic environment effectively ground the surreal elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("place shuts down") but never viscerally felt, as the protagonist encounters no genuine resistance from the environment or the task. The lack of escalation or struggle results in a flat trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and then heavily reinforced by the narrator's moralizing summary ("finally heard the lesson") in the final paragraph, which triggers the penalty for didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and maintains a consistent register that suits the "port mage" persona. However, the narrative distance remains safe, filtering the experience through competence rather than immediate vulnerability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with clear imagery, though phrases like "thoughts stacked themselves with surgical precision" rely on cliché. The "ribbon of intention" metaphor stack in the climax is slightly overwrought but legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blend of port logistics and geomancy is an appealing premise, but the execution follows a standard "unappreciated genius proves authority wrong" template without subverting the trope or adding emotional complexity.</comment>
