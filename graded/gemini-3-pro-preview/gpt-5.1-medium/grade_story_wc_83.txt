<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s transformation from a hunter of abstract futures to a protector of specific ghosts is deeply earned. The internal conflict—seeking control to mitigate trauma—resolves beautifully when the "unused potential" is recognized not as a threat, but as lost kin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure is impeccable, utilizing the cooling circuit breakers as a tight narrative window. The closure acts as a Decisive Change, where the protagonist utilizes the established mechanics (perturbation) to reclaim agency in a way that feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is visceral, blending the high-tech sterility of the observatory with the gritty memory of the desert. The geode, with its "violet teeth" and reaction to the ship's engines, serves as a perfect physical bridge between the two worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly delineated between the official mission (global stability via suppression) and the personal mission (redeeming the dead). The escalation from observing a data anomaly to recognizing a mass grave of potential provides strong, coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The thematic reconfiguration of "probability wells" as the accumulated weight of stolen lives is masterful. The story avoids abstract moralizing by grounding the concept in specific lost futures (the pilot, the baker), delivering deep resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and authoritative, seamlessly welding technical lexicon ("perturbation," "resolution," "coordinates") with the lyrical imagery of grief. The narrative distance is controlled perfectly to reflect the protagonist’s attempted detachment and ultimate failure to remain detached.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and highly figurative, which effectively establishes the "bleak exhilaration" tone, though the opening paragraph nears saturation. The writing clears into sharp, active syntax during the climax, demonstrating excellent control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone warfare trauma with quantum market analytics is a genuinely fresh conceptual framework. Treating the "unused potential" of victims as a destabilizing force in the probability field is a unique and poignant sci-fi conceit.</comment>
