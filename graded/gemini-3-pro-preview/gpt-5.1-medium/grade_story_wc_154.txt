<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal conflict between neutrality and compassion is vividly dramatized. The choice to "graft new meaning" by lying about the smudged cast message serves as a decisive micro-choice with felt emotional cost. Her role as "reluctant confessor" is earned through action, not just exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The single-scene structure is tight, maintaining coherent pressure from the initial translation to the transfer of the coral. The closure—accepting the coral as a "deputized" memory—acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's burden effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting details—"sweated a jungle hush," "iodine, wet stone"—create a specific, pressurized atmosphere that mirrors the boy's internal state. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting element (shrapnel turned landscape) that anchors the final imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate quietly but effectively through the translation of the cast messages. The pressure peaks with the boy's impossible question about the sea, forcing Mara to abandon neutrality. The cost is the emotional weight she carries out of the room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of translation, trauma, and nature are woven seamlessly; the concept of words as "grafts" is particularly strong. The ending recontextualizes the hospital's unresolved pain as "unclaimed translations," offering resonant thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the "pacific conflict-zone translator" persona. The shift from technical observation to poetic interpretation ("fragile scripture") feels motivated by the character's empathy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("inked exhaustion," "sedimentary scars") with high information density. While the figurative language is heavy in the climax ("lotus-hearted ache," "muddy blooms"), it remains coherent within the established voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the translator's role with the specific imagery of the coral shrapnel and the cast messages creates a fresh, non-generic perspective on the war-hospital trope. The specific detail of the coral elevates the premise.</comment>
