<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysa is a capable, empathetic protagonist whose internal conflict (the arrogance of translation vs. the need to heal) drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct; she actively commands the spirits and interprets the vision, rather than passively observing. The interplay of professional detachment and "fierce tenderness" creates a grounded emotional center.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story delivers excellent on-page closure via a Conceptual Repricing: the brother's death is recontextualized from pride to fear, altering the meaning of the client's grief. The "rewind" mechanism is established early enough to feel earned, and the causal link between Lysa's command and the vision's shift is precise. The ending lands with a visible, felt cost (exhaustion, the weight of the new truth).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and functional, actively constraining the action (the roots caging the spirit) and providing the mechanism for resolution (the condensation on invisible windows). The gargoyle shard tasting of old storms is a vivid, history-rich detail that grounds the magical elements. The environment acts as a crucible for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the spirits' lullaby to an inquisitive song, then to a near-scream that forces Lysa to act. The stakes are clear—recovering the specific emotional truth of the death—and the obstacle (the spirits' resistance) is overcome through Lysa's direct agency. The cost is felt in the physical toll and the "ragged breath" at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "unspoken apologies" and the complexity of grief is handled with nuance, avoiding simple platitudes. The distinction between anger/pride and fear as the root of the tragedy offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The "fragile map" ending reinforces the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, suited to the "cryptic medium" persona. The sensory details are filtered through Lysa's specific expertise (hearing vowels in wind, feeling the shard's pulse). The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying close to her perception throughout the ordeal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-density and evocative, but suffers from a significant repetition artifact: the specific phrase "fierce tenderness" appears twice verbatim within a short space, breaking immersion. Additionally, "un writing" appears as a spacing error or typo (likely intended as "unwriting" or "un-writing"). These slips mar an otherwise polished surface.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mangrove setting, the "singing spirits," and the "invisible windows" condensation mechanic creates a fresh, memorable visual language for a séance. The gargoyle shard as a sensory tool adds a unique texture to the medium archetype.</comment>
