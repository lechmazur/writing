<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, though the "reluctant" trait is asserted rather than dramatized in her swift, competent action. Her internal state is vivid, but the lack of hesitation or significant internal obstacle makes her success feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with a tangible shift in the fleet's behavior. However, the progression is linear and low-friction, as the solution works immediately without complication, adaptation, or a "try-fail" cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory grounding is exceptional, utilizing "cooled basalt," "wet rope," and "old honey" to create a tactile, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively supports the mood, with the lighthouse functioning as a resonant instrument for the magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>External stakes (the fleet, the sea's anger) are clear, but the internal or interpersonal stakes are low; Jorah offers no real opposition, and the magic exacts no visible price. The escalation is linear, lacking a moment of severe doubt or necessary sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of gentleness over force is perfectly integrated into the plot mechanics and final image. The ending resonates strongly, delivering a clear conceptual repricing of the lighthouse's function from warning to welcome without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and confident, matching the magical realism tone without breaking immersion. The POV stays firmly with Mara, filtering the world through her specific "sorcerer of signals" lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("mist slipped... like breath"), but relies frequently on "like" and "as if" similes to carry descriptions. Phrasing is polished, though the "adjective and adjective" rhythm ("blunt and heavy," "sluggish and mean") becomes noticeable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse mechanics with olfactory magic is a fresh, imaginative concept that revitalizes the standard "calming the storm" trope. The specific execution moves it beyond a vignette into a distinct narrative artifact.</comment>
