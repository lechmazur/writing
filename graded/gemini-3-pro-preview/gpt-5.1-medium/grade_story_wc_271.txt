<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mariam is a deeply realized focalizer; her physical symptoms (tremor, freezing) effectively ground the backstory in present action. The internal conflict—between the safety of the arboretum and the intrusion of traumatic memory—is handled with nuance. The choice to fold the photograph is a poignant micro-move that earns the stasis at the end, demonstrating resilience without erasing the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory details and memory until the gull trigger forces a recalibration. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration; the folding of the photo and the return to the tram signal a shift in stance. The reliance on the therapist's definitions as exposition slightly scaffolds the internal logic, but causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the arboretum acts as both sanctuary and mirror. The image of plants reaching for a phantom lighthouse beam brilliantly parallels the protagonist’s condition, charging the final beat with deep resonance. The environment actively constrains the protagonist (no drones) and shapes the emotional landscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mariam’s psychological stability—is tested by the gull’s dive, a credible and effective escalation in a quiet story. The pressure is coherent, moving from ambient dread to acute panic and back to a hard-won equilibrium. The cost is visible in the physical seizing of her shoulder and the reduction of the bride in the photo to a blur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of anchoring optimism in realism is powerfully felt, though the explicit articulation of "Some truths did not cancel each other" borders on essayistic. However, framing this as an entry in her notebook mitigates the issue, grounding the philosophy in character action. The "pearl of stillness" concept lands well as a redefinition of resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely focalized, managing the shift between sensory observation and traumatic memory smoothly. The perceptual signature is distinct, particularly in how she maps the veins of the leaf like henna patterns. Control over psychic distance is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Imagery like "waves chewed at the black rocks... grinding teeth" is visceral and effective. A slight reliance on simile constructions ("like smoke," "like a second sun," "like rocks") prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone strike survivor finding refuge in a defunct lighthouse arboretum is fresh and avoids cliché. The story transforms the prompt elements into a cohesive, emotional narrative. The specific detail of the "quietly talented" hands mapping futures on leaves adds a unique layer to the recovery trope.</comment>
