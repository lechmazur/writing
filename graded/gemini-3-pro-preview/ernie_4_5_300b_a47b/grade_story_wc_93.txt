<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear, but her internal arc feels slightly mechanical; the shift from controller to witness is an archetype rather than a deeply felt, idiosyncratic struggle. The emotional weight of her mother's loss is stated rather than dramatized in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear trial-and-error loop, but the climax wavers in agency; the curse reveals the "correct" future before Lira fully commits to the final action, softening the risk of her choice. The "not yet" realization feels rushed, arriving more from plot necessity than accumulated pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The frictionless water constraint is inventive and vividly rendered, grounding the magic system well. However, specific Earth-based terms like "Fibonacci" and "Pascal’s triangle" clash tonally with the high-fantasy setting, breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are legible, but the "storm of star dust" remains an abstract consequence rather than a visceral, immediate threat. The conflict resolution is relatively smooth, lacking a moment where Lira is forced to sacrifice something tangible to succeed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph, explicitly stating the moral ("not a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor") instead of letting the image resonate. This didacticism flattens the subtext at the crucial moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the transition to the epiphany feels slightly more authorial than character-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory details ("liquid green and violet"), though the "clicking" of rocks in sand is a slight physical incongruity. The intrusion of textbook mathematical terminology into a mystic ritual creates a jarring register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "frictionless" concept combined with eel herding is a genuinely fresh and compelling premise. The resolution, however, falls back on a familiar "surrender control to gain harmony" trope, which feels safer than the setup promised.</comment>
