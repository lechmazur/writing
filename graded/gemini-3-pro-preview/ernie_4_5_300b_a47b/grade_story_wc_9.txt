<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal grief is well-rendered and specific, anchoring the ritual in clear motivation. The emotional arc is coherent, though the mother's dialogue leans into stock sentimentality ("little star") that simplifies the complex survivor guilt established earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sequence follows a dream logic that fits the genre, but the closure relies on a "gift ending" where the saucer heals and the handprint appears magically. This lacks the "visible or felt cost" required by the rubric; the resolution fixes the external symbol without extracting a price from the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strong suit, with distinct sensory details like "ozone and old starlight" and roots coiling like hourglasses. The setting actively supports the ritual, though the "glass city" feels slightly like a backdrop change rather than a grounded space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds effectively through the card reading and the widening crack. However, the climax dissolves the tension rather than tightening it; the mother's appearance instantly resolves the conflict, removing the struggle necessary for a high-stakes payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief is clear, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the final dialogue ("Repentance isn't a place. It's a choice") to state the moral explicitly. This reduces subtextual resonance and flattens the complexity of the penance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for a cartomancer. The POV remains tightly focused on Elara, with sensory perceptions filtered effectively through her specific burden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally strong, but prompt integration forces semantic errors ("unfastening the saucer's crack," "cracks we willingly perplex"). These usages break the physical logic of the sentence to accommodate required words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of using tarot to contact the dead is a familiar trope. While the imagery (hourglass roots) is fresh, the emotional resolution tracks a standard "healing" path without a surprising conceptual turn.</comment>
