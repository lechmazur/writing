<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal shift is summarized ("kindled a humility") rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices. The transition from arrogance to humility feels inevitable and smooth rather than earned through resistance or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The structure violates scope defaults by relying on summary ("monitored it daily") and a significant time jump ("Weeks later") to reach the ending. This dissipates the scene's immediate pressure and reduces the narrative to a montage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, grounding abstract concepts in "silt-clogged drains" and "moth-eaten ferns." The greenhouse functions effectively as a textured crucible that contrasts with the character's clean scientific background.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>External conflict is dismissed in summary ("She ignored them"), and the climax—a symposium presentation—lacks visceral risk or failure states. The stakes remain abstract and intellectual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but explicitly preached in the final dialogue ("Gradual change is the universe's only constant"), triggering a penalty for sermonizing/Thematic Echo at the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully filters the natural world through a distinct astrophysical lexicon ("accretion disks," "pulsar"), maintaining a consistent and unique perspective throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, though occasionally heavy-handed with metaphorical pairings ("waveform of a dying pulsar"). The scientific terminology is integrated without disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of an astrophysicist decoding decay offers a fresh intellectual angle, though the execution follows a familiar "scientist humbled by nature" trajectory without a surprising structural twist.</comment>
