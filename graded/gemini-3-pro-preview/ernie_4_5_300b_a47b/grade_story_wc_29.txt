<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lila is a competent but static protagonist; she encounters a problem and solves it without internal contradiction or emotional cost. The repeated use of the prompt attribute ("cautiously hopeful") as a label rather than an enacted state flattens her interiority. There is no moment where her competence is tested by a genuine blind spot or flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "Plan A works" structure where the solution (subsonic frequencies) meets no resistance, resulting in immediate surrender by the antagonist. The "Weeks later" temporal jump disrupts the short-story container, appending a sequel-hook coda instead of integrating the consequence into the main scene's closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the station are vivid, particularly the "hum of the transmitter" and the visual of charts converging. However, the setting descriptions occasionally lean on generic tech-thriller tropes ("maze of cables," "green waves") rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The conflict lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist (the tricksters) surrenders instantly upon Lila's first attempt to interfere, rendering the stakes theoretical. There is no on-page cost or trade-off required to achieve victory, merely the execution of a technical skill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of order versus chaos is present but handled superficially through the binary of dissonance and harmony. The ending shifts metaphors abruptly from musical harmony to "power is a river," muddying the thematic coherence. The concept of the "game" is stated rather than emerging organically from the struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, but the dialogue often functions as exposition ("The community’s dividing, Lila") rather than natural speech. The narrative voice is serviceable but slips into melodrama at the end ("echoed in her skull"), distancing the reader from the grounded reality established earlier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by cliché clusters like "thinly veiled," "gravelly whisper," and "loyal beast." The description of the resolution ("sound like wind chimes made of starlight") tilts into purple prose that clashes with the otherwise technical tone of the station.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the premise of a radio station battling cosmic entities has potential, the execution follows a standard problem-solution path without subversion. The "cosmic trickster" archetype is familiar, and the story plays the trope straight rather than finding a fresh, specific angle.</comment>
