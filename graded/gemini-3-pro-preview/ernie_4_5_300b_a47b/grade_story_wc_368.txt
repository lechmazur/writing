<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lin’s internal conflict (donor heart vs. old self) provides a functional motivation for the scene, but her "desperation" is told via interior summary rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The "dye master" aspect colors the opening but is abandoned for the main action, failing to shape the decisive turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (loss of the wing, acceptance of role) lands with a clear change in state. However, the causal link between the wing's reflection and the patron’s storytelling relies on a situational/magical coincidence rather than strict character agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is established with vivid, ethereal imagery ("obsidian stones," "golden threads") that supports the tone well. While atmospheric, the "floating" nature of the tea house is largely aesthetic and does not constrain the action or physics of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("understand why some lives became vessels for legend") and the pressure is low; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle to Lin's action. The escalation is visual (light gets brighter) rather than a deepening of risk or consequence until the sudden loss of the wing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit exposition in the final paragraphs ("She realized then...", "Lin knew what she had to do"). The ending summarizes the moral ("some stories are meant to be shared") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, though it relies on filter verbs ("Lin felt," "She realized") to convey interiority. The perspective stays firmly with Lin, effectively mediating the "wonder" tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm is smooth, but the prose leans on stock phrasing ("moths to a flame," "stolen secret," "invisible threads") and expository transitions. The density of "told" realizations in the final third reduces the immediate impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The combination of elements creates a pleasant "cozy fantasy" tableau, though the core mechanic (magical object reveals destiny) is a familiar trope. The synthesis is competent but lacks a subversive or highly original twist on the premise.</comment>
