<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a vessel for the ritual without emotional risk. Her motivation is purely intellectual, and she faces no significant opposition or difficult micro-choices that would reveal character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear success sequence (theory to test to success) without obstruction or complication. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction—the magic works exactly as intended—lacking the required cost (visible, felt, or conceptual) to earn the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The setting is established with some sensory detail ("weathered dock post," "amber haze"), but relies on pathetic fallacy ("streetlights daydreamed") rather than concrete constraints. The acoustic properties of the bay are mentioned but do not significantly pressure the protagonist's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretical and low; there is no penalty for failure and no opposing force, resulting in a flat pressure curve. The escalation is merely procedural (placing objects) rather than a rising tide of risk or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("hush wasn't emptiness; it was potential"), reducing resonance to a summary statement. The story explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, but the label "creeping normality noticer" feels clumsy and artificial. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into explaining the protagonist's thoughts rather than showing her perception in real-time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is competent but marred by "purple" anthropomorphism ("streetlights daydreamed") and telling ("inadvertently profound"). The pacing drags during the exposition of the theory, and the line-level work lacks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The "displaced objects" concept has potential, but the execution follows a standard "magic ritual works perfectly" template without subversion or fresh synthesis. The outcome is predictable from the premise.</comment>
