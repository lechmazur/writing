<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is legible, but the summary mode creates emotional distance; Mara’s internal state is reported via adjectives ("restless energy") rather than dramatized through pressure-filled choices in a specific moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure fails the short-story scope test, relying on a year-long montage ("Days passed," "By summer") instead of a dramatized scene; the resolution hinges on a convenient expository inscription.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid ("fiery confetti") but leans toward decorative purple prose; the setting details function more as static backdrops than as constraints that force character tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and intellectual without a felt cost; the lack of a compressed timeline dissipates urgency, allowing success to come from passive observation rather than struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and text ("dark nourishes what the light scorches"), robbing the ending of subtext; the resolution offers a didactic moral rather than earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly curated, relying on "art-speak" and lyrical abstraction; the narrative distance prevents visceral engagement with the character's discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting reduces impact ("pulsed like heartbeats," "equation... in starlight"); summary transitions ("One frigid morning") break momentum and prevent the formation of a cohesive scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of an artist decoding a historical mystery is familiar, and the execution relies on convenient tropes (the hidden message explaining the theme) without a fresh, specific twist.</comment>
