<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael is a solid focalizer with clear motivation (survival vs. duty) and a defined internal conflict. His choice to physically intervene ("shoving her") against the rules demonstrates agency and prioritization of life over the curse. However, his interiority relies slightly on standard "reluctant guardian" tropes without deeper idiosyncratic shading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear situational drive and "Earned Stasis" closure where the traveler escapes but Kael remains bound. The central constraint ("leave impressions without touching") is phrased ambiguously; it seemingly contradicts the immediate action of "arranging stones," confusing the story's causal logic regarding the magic system.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with the "nut" serving as a brilliant grounding object that bridges the micro and macro scales. The contrast between the natural rot and the mechanical birds is vivid, though the "illusion" aspect of the labyrinth mentioned in exposition is not dramatized in the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates effectively through the closing distance of the mechanical birds and the encroaching frost. The stakes are palpable, and the climax forces a decisive risk (opening the door/shoving the traveler) that carries the "felt cost" of the labyrinth's shuddering displeasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding order in chaos ("graceless beauty") and the burden of stewardship is well-integrated. The ending reinforces the cyclical nature of the curse without feeling futile, offering a resonant moment of duty fulfilled at a personal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately grim, maintaining a close third-person perspective that enhances the tension. The tone matches the "bruised sky" aesthetic, though it occasionally dips into slightly elevated, conscious writerliness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is functional and rhythmic but relies heavily on stock similes ("twisted like veins," "sap like blood," "unblinking intelligence") that dull the imagery's impact. The phrasing of the constraint ("leave impressions without touching: arrange stones") creates a syntactic logic bump that momentarily obscures the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a map etched onto a nut used as a physical key is inventive and fresh. While the "mechanical birds in a labyrinth" trope is familiar, the specific tactile execution of the caretaker's tools elevates the premise above standard fantasy fare.</comment>
