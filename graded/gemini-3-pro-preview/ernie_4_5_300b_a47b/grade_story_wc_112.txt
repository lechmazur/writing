<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Veyra acts as a functional operator rather than a character with internal conflict; "obliging" is a label rather than a driver of choice. The "curiosity" awakened at the end is stated in exposition rather than earned through a high-stakes struggle or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc (setup, wobble, fix) without a decisive change or legible cost. The resolution restores the status quo immediately, lacking the "felt cost" or reconfiguration required for effective closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting details are visually clear ("ammonia clouds," "lavender glow") and establish the scene well. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop rather than constraining Veyra's choices or pressuring the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Conflict is purely mechanical—a brief system destabilization resolved by rapid button-pushing. Stakes remain theoretical ("proving" a concept) and the resolution requires no difficult trade-off, lowering the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme of non-linear time is explicitly lectured by the Director and the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action. The parallel between Veyra and the flora is stated on-the-nose ("awakened something in her, too").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative distance is padded by frequent filter verbs ("Veyra knew," "swore she could feel"), which dulls immediacy. The voice is serviceable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically competent but marred by clichés ("stomach dropped," "hands flew") and prompt-forced phrasing that sits awkwardly in the sentences. The repetition of the "hush" phrase works as a bracket but feels slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise of scientists activating alien flora is a familiar genre standard. The "time moves sideways" concept creates visual flair but doesn't structurally innovate or deepen the narrative logic beyond standard technobabble.</comment>
