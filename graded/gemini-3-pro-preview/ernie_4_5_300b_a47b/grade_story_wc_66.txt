<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lira is defined by a stated vocation rather than dramatized choices. Her motivation is explicitly told ("not nobility but necessity") rather than demonstrated through a high-stakes trade-off or risk. The character remains static, observing and recording without confronting internal contradiction or paying a personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear vignette (tunes radio, hears song, records lyrics, leaves) rather than a story with a causal arc. There is no Decisive Change or Reconfiguration; the ending reiterates the status quo established in the opening. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation lacks a turning point or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and clearly drawn, though it relies on genre tropes ("ashen plains," "bioluminescent moss"). The environment provides mood but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts; the mist and cold are mentioned but easily managed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the primary opposition is static interference, which clears quickly. There is no meaningful escalation or risk of failure; Lira succeeds in her goal without needing to sacrifice anything or change her approach. The stakes are high in concept (saving stories) but low in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through direct statement ("teach dust to tell stories," "The dust remembers") rather than subtext or action. The narrative acts as a delivery system for its own thesis, resulting in an earnest but heavy-handed execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it leans toward melodrama ("whispers from the void," "cocoon"). The tone is stable, but the reliance on "poetic" affectation creates a distance that prevents visceral engagement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from overwriting and noun stacks ("shortwave radio dial glow"). Several phrases hover near cliché ("curled like smoke," "tasted of iron"). The phrasing "thistled calm" is semantically opaque and feels forced.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "archivist in a ruined world" trope is handled competently but without fresh subversion or specific, idiosyncratic detail. The core concept feels like a standard response to a "lost media" prompt without a unique twist on the human cost.</comment>
