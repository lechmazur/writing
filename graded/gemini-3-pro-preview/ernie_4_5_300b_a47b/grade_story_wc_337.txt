<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mara serves as a passive observer who relies entirely on Elias for exposition and direction; her internal conflict is summarized in abstract terms rather than dramatized through contradictory choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative resolves via a magical gift (the key appearing) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's actions; the ending explains the moral without exacting a legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but functions as a static backdrop; the "glass walls" and "prisms" are ornamental details that do not constrain the action or influence tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("risk unleashing the noise") but never tested against a concrete obstacle; the "fear" is mentioned but dismissed immediately without forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Silence isn't always kindness"), substituting lecture for organic, subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dialogue is stiff and functional, serving primarily to dispense backstory; the narrative voice relies on stock phrasing ("moves like smoke") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically functional but weakened by frequent filter verbs ("Mara realized," "She felt") and lazy transitions ("Suddenly"), lacking rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise of mending memories is handled with standard fantasy tropes (mysterious mentor, magical artifact), resulting in a safe, formulaic execution without fresh ingenuity.</comment>
