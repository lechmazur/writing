<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara functions as a passive observer and recording device rather than a protagonist under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction or resistance. Her success is immediate and unearned, with no visible psychological or physical cost to her "projecting presence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear sequence of convenient events without causal friction; the protagonist arrives, uses a magical ability without difficulty, and receives instant closure. The ending offers a "tidy bow" resolution where all absences are explained and the character leaves happier, lacking any narrative tension or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("shadowed garden," "pale gown," "scent of jasmine") rather than specific, constraining details. While atmospheric, the environment functions as a static backdrop that accommodates the protagonist's needs rather than pressuring them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, no environmental obstacle, and no internal reluctance. The "ghost" appears immediately upon request and provides exactly the information needed to resolve the scene, creating a flat narrative arc without escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit sermons and on-the-nose metaphors ("healing was not a destination but a geography") rather than subtext or action. The ending serves as a moral summary that explains the meaning to the reader, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but heavily affected, relying on melodramatic phrasing ("fractures in souls," "lonesome splendor") that creates distance. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She saw," "She imagined") frequently cushion the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high density of clichés ("silver river," "whisper of autumn leaves," "stark relief") and purple descriptors. Phrases from the prompt are repeated as refrains ("after the last ship sailed"), creating a repetitive cadence without adding narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the concept of an "obituary writer for the living" is intriguing, it is executed through standard "ghost in the garden" tropes. The story risks nothing, settling for a safe, sentimental encounter that lacks a fresh twist or emotional complexity.</comment>
