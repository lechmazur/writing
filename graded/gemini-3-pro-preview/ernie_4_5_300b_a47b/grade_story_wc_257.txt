<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on summary and label-speak ("grief had hollowed him," "atonement") rather than embodied emotion. The emotional arc feels linear and predetermined, lacking the internal contradiction or resistance required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure is competent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but the climax (lighting the lantern) transitions too smoothly into a resolved epiphany without immediate scene-level obstacles. The ending relies on a magical realism summary ("Travelers spoke of...") that distances the reader from the cost of the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting is established with vivid, if slightly romanticized, sensory details ("cold stone floor," "rusted telescopes"). The visual of the "curtains of intention" is strong, though the global coordinates feel somewhat abstract and list-like rather than grounded in the scene's immediate reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("redemption") but lack immediate pressure; the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without material failure or distinct trade-offs. The conflict remains internal and is resolved through realization rather than a high-stakes decision with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("curtains... were not a cure for grief, but a language for it") rather than emerging through subtext. The story explains its symbols as they appear, leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonance beyond the literal text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into "purple" prose ("time pooled like mercury," "creases holding the weight"). The poetic register is sustained but occasionally feels like an overlay rather than arising from the character's specific perceptual lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("shadow of his former self," "rock bottom," "glimmer of hope," "burning certainty"). While grammatically clean, the reliance on stock phrases dampens the emotional impact and originality of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core concept of projecting a tattoo stencil as a light map is imaginative and visually distinct. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes of the mourning artisan and magical letters, and the "magic note" ending feels derivative of inspirational fiction templates.</comment>
