<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices; the protagonist succeeds at every task with "reckless precision" rather than struggle. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("mind like a labyrinth") and explicit diagnostic realization ("dammed her own river").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The causal chain in the translation scene relies on "magical" logical leaps (river -> mill -> mead -> wedding) that lack genuine grounded causality. Closure is achieved, but the resolution with the sister is abrupt and lacks resistance or visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archive atmosphere is established well with sensory details ("mothball-scented," "static of forgotten tongues"). The setting supports the tone, though it acts more as a backdrop than a constraint on the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces slight skepticism from Henrik which immediately turns to support. The sister answers the phone and accepts the overture instantly, removing the potential for high-stakes rejection or emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("It’s the promise behind them," "Do you trust enough to be vulnerable?"). This diagnostic label-speak flattens subtext and reduces the thematic resonance to a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dialogue feels unnatural and serves primarily to deliver thematic exposition. Voices are indistinct; characters speak in complete, grammatically perfect sentences about abstract concepts even in emotional moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is functional but repetitive with key phrases ("unsnarled," "reckless") and relies on cliché ("ink-stained fingers"). The use of abstract metaphors ("symphonies of truth") in place of concrete description reduces impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The premise of a linguist using translation to heal a relationship is executed with familiar tropes. The "magic logic" used to solve the puzzle feels convenient rather than ingenious.</comment>
