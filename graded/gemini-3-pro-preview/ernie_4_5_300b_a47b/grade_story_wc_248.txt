<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Mara is defined by diagnostic labels ("analytically intuitive") and a stated role ("arsonist") rather than contradictory impulses or choices under pressure. Her interiority is summarized rather than embodied, making her a vehicle for the plot rather than a living character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The mid-story time jump ("On the third day") breaks the continuous tension required for this short scope and dissipates the narrative drive. The resolution relies on a late-breaking magical effect (paint healing acid) that lacks established causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, grounded by specific textures ("crushed obsidian," "gold spiral") that enhance the atmosphere. However, the spatial geography blurs significantly during the summarized montage section.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The protagonist faces no active opposition; the archive yields instantly to her efforts, and the resolution arrives without any visible or felt cost. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved by magic rather than a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit dialogue ("It's a garden") and a sentimental trope rather than emerging organically from conflict. The ending moralizes the premise instead of letting the subtext resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies on filter verbs ("Mara noted") and abstract summaries ("weight of unspoken stories") that distance the reader. The insertion of prompt terms as descriptors disrupts the narrative immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("tears streaming," "unblinking eye") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("volcanic tenderness") as expository telling. The line-level work tells rather than shows key emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of "arson as translation" is intriguing, but the execution retreats into familiar magical realism tropes and a convenient, sentimental ending that lacks risk or conceptual bite.</comment>
