<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or struggle; his transition from soldier to gardener is summarized rather than dramatized. He faces no difficult choices, functioning more as a competent vessel for the theme than a character in a crucible. Emotional resonance is asserted ("heart light") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is linear and low-tension, lacking a decisive tightening or reversal; obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient bird calls. A causality error undermines the stakes: the jetty is described as "blooming" with "flowers defying the gloom" in the opening, yet the soil is later called "barren," confusing the necessity of his task.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric and cohesive, with vivid details like "crushed bone and ash" and "violet and gold" petals. The setting actively integrates with the action (soil, birds), though descriptors like "gloom-hill" and "sky bled" lean toward generic fantasy tropes without deeper specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the environment that his skills cannot instantly overcome. The "gathering storm" provides atmospheric rather than narrative pressure, and the cost of his action is abstract ("patience") rather than a felt, on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements ("dialect of loss," "time was a language") rather than subtextual emergence. The narrative explains the meaning of symbols immediately upon introduction, leaving little room for reader engagement or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the register occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("petals flickering like tiny flames") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the "dead reef."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but reliant on standard phrasings ("twilight seeped," "defied the gloom") and filter structures ("he heard," "he saw") that dilute immediacy. The reliance on summary to explain the bird calls ("told him to dig deeper") bypasses the sensory experience of the connection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of a soldier gardening a dead reef is visually evocative, but the execution follows a standard "healing via nature" trajectory without unexpected turns. The use of "bird calls" as precise instructions feels like a convenient magical solution rather than a fresh narrative mechanic.</comment>
