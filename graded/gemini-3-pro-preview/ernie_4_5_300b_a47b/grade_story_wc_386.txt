<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; he faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult choices. His "gift" and motivation are stated in exposition but never tested by pressure, resulting in a character who feels like a narrative device rather than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A critical logic break undermines the timeline: the sailor died "a century ago," yet his brother and widow are still alive and dreaming, which is biologically impossible in a realistic setting. Additionally, the closure is low-cost and summary-heavy, resolving complex grief with a simple decision to "weave truth" without visible difficulty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The glacial shrine offers some vivid imagery ("candles... borrowed starlight"), but the setting feels static and disconnected from the action. The timeline impossibility (100-year-old survivors) breaks the world's internal consistency, making the specific relationships feel unearned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks active resistance or stakes; the "mystery" resolves itself through a sequence of visions that arrive without effort or cost. There is no moment where Kael's goal is genuinely threatened, leading to a flat narrative arc with no escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The theme of connection is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Windows... were fragile things") and a sentimental resolution that tidies up grief too neatly. The ending relies on a moralizing summary of how everyone will feel better, rather than earning that resonance through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is functional but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of symbols immediately rather than letting them breathe. The tone is consistent but leans into generic literary phrasing ("danced like ghosts," "skeletal hand") that lacks a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The middle section relies on a repetitive scaffold ("The first dream...", "The second dream...", "The third dream...") that kills momentum and reads like an outline. While the grammar is clean, the prose depends on clichés and abstract summaries rather than concrete, immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost whisperer resolving a cold case via psychometry is a standard trope, and the "it was love, not anger" twist is familiar. The story executes these elements conventionally without a fresh angle or specific, surprising detail to elevate them.</comment>
