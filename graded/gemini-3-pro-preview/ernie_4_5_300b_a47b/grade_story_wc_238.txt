<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clara’s “gossip-column exorcist” persona is a compelling hook that establishes immediate, specific competence. However, her sudden pivot to the pseudo-scientific explanation of the bottle ("copper conducts electricity") feels less like character voice and more like an authorial device to bridge a plot gap. Elias functions adequately as a client, though his "eyes two bruises" description leans into stock moody-musician tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a legible closure with the finished song and the chainsaws starting, effectively utilizing the "Resonant Reconfiguration" form. However, the central mechanism—using a perfume bottle as an electrical conduit for a ghost via piano vibrations—strains causal credibility, even for a fantasy piece. The logic jump from metaphor to literal mechanics is abrupt and weakens the narrative authority.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of a "sheet music archive" with an orchard on the brink of destruction creates a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. The sensory details, such as the dust smelling of regret and the chainsaws idling outside, effectively ground the supernatural elements in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and resolves with relatively low resistance; Elias hesitates, Clara encourages him, and he succeeds. While the ghost's accusation ("You left me") raises the emotional stakes, the resolution (simply playing the song louder/to completion) feels like a "magic button" solution rather than a difficult choice involving sacrifice or ingenuity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" is integrated well, serving as both the magical logic and the emotional resolution. The concept of "reconnecting" rather than exorcising provides a fresh angle on the haunting trope, though the execution leans heavily on the convenient magical properties of the prop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent noir-fantasy tone ("regret was her currency"), fitting the genre well. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into exposition ("Not a key. A person.") or melodrama ("You're insane") that feels slightly manufactured rather than organic to the characters' immediate stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing ("hummed with the hush") and worn clichés ("eyes two bruises," "prismatic shards"). The description of the climax ("glow brightening until it blinded") lacks the fresh, specific imagery found in the setting details, reducing the impact of the peak moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" concept is genuinely inventive and promises a unique worldview. However, the plot itself—a musician finishing a song to appease a ghost—is a familiar trope. The synthesis of the two is competent but relies on standard beats rather than surprising the reader with a fresh structural turn.</comment>
