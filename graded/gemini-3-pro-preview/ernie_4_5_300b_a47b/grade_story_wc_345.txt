<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies almost entirely on expository labels ("altruistic," "consistent," "trustworthy") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara lacks internal contradiction or struggle, acting as a benevolent plot device, while the "settlers" function as a monolithic, cooperative mass without individual distinctness or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary and montage ("Each morning," "The settlers worked for hours") rather than a specific, pressure-filled scene. The resolution creates "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved completely by a collective effort that meets no on-page resistance, draining the climax of tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting is described with generic fantasy tropes ("floating rock arches," "ancient sentinels") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the characters' choices. The environment functions as a backdrop for the fable rather than a physical space with distinct rules or obstacles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>There is virtually no active conflict; the settlers briefly "debate" in summary before immediately cooperating. The stakes are declared ("arches would collapse") but never felt through difficulty or failure, and the resolution comes without any visible cost or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story ends with explicit moralizing that summarizes the theme ("hope was not a solitary pursuit"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The theme is delivered via sermonizing dialogue and narration rather than emerging organically from subtext or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The voice is distant and fable-like, which prevents emotional immersion. Dialogue is stilted and functional ("The nebula... is a promise"), reading more like a thematic thesis statement than natural speech between characters under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose is heavily adjectival and relies on telling over showing ("Elara’s motivation was clear," "brambled hope was palpable"). The pacing is sluggish due to the summary mode, and the phrase "brambled hope" reads as an awkward forceful insertion of a prompt element.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost saving a town through cooperation is a standard trope executed without a fresh angle or subversion. The narrative follows a predictable fable structure with no unexpected synthesis or conceptual risk.</comment>
