<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira functions as a plot device whose "orderly intuition" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. Her internal conflict ("dual allegiance") resolves without personal cost, as she saves the carnival without sacrificing her standing or the chip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Over the next week") that dissipates tension and violates the short-story scope. The resolution is unearned; the antagonist withdraws due to a sentimental speech without exacting a price, failing the requirement for closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "fried dough and diesel" provide a solid anchor, though the setting often leans into standard "cyber-circus" tropes. The environment serves largely as a backdrop rather than a source of physical constraints that force specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The stakes are declared but the opposition is a straw man; the Council retreats immediately upon seeing the mural, lacking causal credibility. There is no escalation of pressure in the final scene, only a presentation that yields an easy victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Themes are articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Efficiency will kill the carnival"), reducing subtext to text. The dichotomy of order vs. chaos is resolved too neatly, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, but the voice relies on familiar descriptors ("riot of striped tents") and expository dialogue. The characters speak in similar registers, often stating the themes directly rather than revealing them through subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is functional but relies on stock phrasing ("voice like ice," "flicker of hope") and clichés. While readable, the line-level craft lacks the textural density or fresh imagery required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "raft city vs. corporate suits" premise is a standard trope executed with a predictable "save the community center" arc. While the graffiti map is a specific detail, the lack of a fresh twist or cost limits ingenuity.</comment>
