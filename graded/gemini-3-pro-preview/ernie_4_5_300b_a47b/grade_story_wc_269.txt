<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s internal obsession ("invisible cracks") is well-drawn, but Kael functions solely as a plot obstacle who capitulates instantly ("Nodded") without earned persuasion. The protagonist’s drive is clear, but the antagonist lacks the friction required to test her conviction meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a massive credibility break when bioluminescent plankton literally spell out coordinates, shattering the established reality. The transition from scientific inquiry to metaphysical journey is rushed ("Three days later"), and the resolution feels like an escape rather than a consequence of a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The station is grounded with specific sensory details ("barnacle," "cool metal"), establishing a strong initial atmosphere. However, the climax dissolves into generic "storm" and "churning" descriptions, losing the tactile specificity that anchored the opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is introduced but barely engaged; Kael dismisses the data and then converts to Lira's side immediately upon seeing the lights, removing all tension from the climax. The stakes shift from scientific validation to survival/exploration without forcing a costly tradeoff on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The thematic pivot—that the fossil fuel ban didn't restore the past but awakened a new, stranger reality—is nuanced and avoids simple moralizing. The concept of "healing" as "changing" provides a resonant conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into melodrama ("mosaic of grief"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone wavers between hard sci-fi and mystical fantasy without fully earning the bridge between them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from cliché ("gnawed by time," "bones in a graveyard") and overly literal imagery (plankton spelling numbers). The rhythm is generally good, but the "tapping" motif borders on twee in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of a post-fossil fuel ban world awakening ancient forces rather than simply healing is a fresh and intriguing inversion of standard cli-fi tropes. However, the execution relies on familiar "magical map" devices that dilute the conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
