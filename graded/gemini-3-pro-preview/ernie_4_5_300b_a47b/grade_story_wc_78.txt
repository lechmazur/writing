<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Leeward is a distinct, competent focalizer with embodied reactions ("hands trembled," "sweat sticking"). However, her internal landscape is somewhat functional, lacking a deep contradictory impulse or a difficult choice beyond the physical exertion of her task. The motivation is stated in dialogue rather than emerging solely from pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Situational arc, moving from the threat of disorder to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the setting. The pacing is solid, and the closure—order restored through the integration of chaos—lands with physical cost ("arms ached"), though the linear progression lacks a sharp causal twist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and highly specific, with "sun-bleached driftwood" and "kelp ropes" grounding the surreal premise. The physical constraints of the narrowing circle directly influence the choreography (forcing her to pivot), satisfying the requirement for the environment to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (survival of the orchard), and pressure escalates through the environment and the "restless" euphony. The "seabird screech" offers a moment of adaptation, but the resolution feels slightly inevitable; the protagonist faces external resistance but no significant internal doubt or cost beyond fatigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The explicit articulation of the thesis ("Obstacles are just instruments...") in both dialogue and the final narrative summary constitutes a "Thematic Echo," reducing resonance by stating what should be implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, employing a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the mythic tone. The POV remains firmly anchored in Leeward’s sensory experience. Some phrasing borders on "purple" ("air thrummed like a hive"), but it generally serves the atmosphere well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm and density are generally good, but distinct artifacts mar the execution. The "sheet music" simile is repeated twice in the opening section ("frayed like sheet music," "scattered... like discarded sheet music"), and the repetition of "euphony" and "fractal" feels circular rather than cumulative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a floating orchard tuned like an instrument is imaginative and distinct. While the "magic musician" trope is familiar, the specific synthesis of driftwood, fractals, and tides offers a fresh, sensory-rich angle on the premise.</comment>
