<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s internal conflict is clear, but the external recognition by the stranger relies on convenient exposition ("You're the firefighter...") rather than organic discovery. The protagonist’s identity is stated more than dramatized through high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The climax relies on a significant break in physical credibility; a bird with a freshly broken wing cannot "soar" immediately after a crude splinting, especially dragging a metal coin. This "magic healing" undermines the story's realism and closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with "obsidian lagoon" and "volcanic sand" grounding the scene effectively. The environment mirrors the internal state well, though some descriptions ("hissed like a secret") lean toward the abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The stakes remain low; the confrontation with the man is defused instantly with a single line, avoiding genuine interpersonal pressure. The bird’s immediate recovery removes the cost of the rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The final paragraph devolves into explicit moralizing ("Compassion, she thought, wasn't about..."), summarizing the theme rather than letting the imagery do the work. The "scars could sing" motif feels repetitive and forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism. The perspective stays close to Lira, but the dialogue feels slightly functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is generally strong, but the physical impossibility of the climax (bird flight) indicates a lack of attention to detail. The phrase "gracefully alert" is inserted awkwardly, disrupting the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "arsonist's daughter turning firefighter" is a familiar trope executed here with competence but little subversion. The magical realism of the bird healing clashes with the gritty setting.</comment>
