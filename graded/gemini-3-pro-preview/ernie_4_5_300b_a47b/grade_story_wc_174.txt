<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is clearly defined, but his transition from exploitative eulogist to subversive puppeteer is summarized rather than felt. The trait "urbane calligrapher" colors the narration ("ink-stained fingers") but doesn't deeply constrain his tactical choices in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the reversed projection and campfire epiphany) lands a Conceptual Repricing. However, the sequence lacks causal friction; the performance succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt or failure that forces a harder choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "skeletal ribs" and "fractured light" of the dome actively shape the projection mechanics and thematic resonance. The physical space is well-integrated with the central metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Pressure is low. The only external opposition (the drifter's scoff) is immediately diffused by Elias agreeing ("Exactly"), removing the potential for conflict. Success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("Stories are thieves," "Ethical storytelling isn't about..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The characters speak the story's thesis rather than letting it emerge from the subtext of the performance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though occasionally leaning into purple prose ("shadows that danced like restless spirits"). Point of view remains stable with Elias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but relies on some clichés ("motley crew," "piercing the dusk"). The phrase "meteor hush" feels awkward and forced, likely an artifact of prompt insertion that disrupts the semantic flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of high-tech debris (radar dome) with primal storytelling (runes/fire) is effective. However, the "wandering storyteller teaching a lesson" trope is played straight without a significant subversive twist.</comment>
