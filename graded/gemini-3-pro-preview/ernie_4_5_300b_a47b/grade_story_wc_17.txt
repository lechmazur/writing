<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira is a clearly defined focalizer with a distinct role, and her choice to burn the negative demonstrates agency. However, her motivation ("what walls dream about") remains abstract, and the internal cost of sacrificing the grandmother's relic is somewhat muted by the swift transition to the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exploration to discovery and a decisive closure act. The causal link between burning the negative and the ivy parting relies on dream logic that borders on convenience, though it fits the atmospheric drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is established with vivid sensory details like "wet earth and iron" and "charred fragments," effectively grounding the reader. The concept of an "echo cartographer" promises auditory detail that is only partially delivered, as the climax is primarily visual and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates adequately with the groaning walls, prompting the protagonist's action. The conflict is primarily environmental and thematic; while the stakes are clear, the resolution comes rapidly after the climax, reducing the lingering sense of peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The central theme is explicitly articulated in the diary ("The legacy's burden is not in the keeping..."), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for high-end fiction. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, turning the discovery into a direct instruction rather than an earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a reverent, slightly poetic tone throughout. It falters slightly with stock phrasing ("soft as wind through leaves") but maintains a stable third-person limited perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché similes ("curved like a question mark") and the clumsy, forced phrasing of "sensitively perceptive," which reads as a prompt insertion artifact. These slips disrupt the otherwise solid textural quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "echo cartographer" concept is inventive, but the execution follows a standard "ruin exploration" template. The ending ("You are the map") is a familiar trope in this genre, lacking a truly fresh or subversive twist on the premise.</comment>
