<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is visceral and her internal state tracks well with the action, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("It’s anger. It’s grief") rather than embodied reaction. This self-analysis during a high-pressure moment flattens the emotional reality into abstract categories, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with the "circuit breakers" providing effective ticking-clock tension that forces the inciting action. The closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (destruction of safety for power), though the "superhero origin" beat at the very end feels slightly more genre-standard than literary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct; the "floating observatory" and the "glass floor" serve as excellent filters for the protagonist’s perception of trauma. The sensory details ("ozone and ash," "fractal shadows") ground the high-concept premise effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalate appropriately; the choice to ignore the safety warnings demonstrates agency and risk. The cost—the destruction of the observatory—is a tangible price paid for the protagonist’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic articulation, particularly in the final paragraphs where the protagonist’s transformation is explicitly labeled ("She was a disrupter"). This "telling" undermines the resonance of the imagery, violating the show-don't-tell standard for high-end literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and captures the tension well. However, it slips into melodramatic or movie-trailer phrasing at the end ("Caution's overrated," "Let them come"), which distances the reader from the intimate psychological portrait established earlier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and propulsive, but relies on some stock phrasing ("images flashed," "node screamed") during peak intensity. The explicit naming of the tone ("bleak exhilaration") reduces the impact that describing the sensation itself would have achieved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of mining trauma sites for "unused potential" via physics is highly original and compelling. The execution, however, settles into a familiar empowered-survivor trope by the end, slightly dimming the ingenuity of the setup.</comment>
