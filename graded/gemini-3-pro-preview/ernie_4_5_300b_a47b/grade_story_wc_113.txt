<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clara’s motivation shifts abruptly from vague inspiration to a life-defining vow to "prove the ghost’s existence," relying on off-page skeptics to generate stakes. While her internal state is consistent, her emotional progression feels linear and slightly convenient, lacking the contradiction or resistance required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (vowing to finish the symphony) is legible. However, the climax relies on a "force majeure" (burst pipe) and instant competence (memorizing the code in seconds) to resolve the conflict, which bypasses the felt cost of losing the physical artifact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the flooded pit and "floating cello bow" create a vivid, tangible atmosphere that constrains movement. The sensory details ("glistening like spider silk") ground the ghostly elements effectively, though the mechanics of the lanterns remain slightly vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily atmospheric and external rather than driven by a difficult choice between competing values. The potential cost of the climax—losing the code—is immediately negated by Clara's convenient perfect memory, flattening the stakes of the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of "unfinished business" and liminal spaces is present but articulated through explicit statements ("liminal space between life and death") rather than subtext. The ending leans into melodrama ("I'll finish it") rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable, but the voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("theater sighed," "thrum in approval") that feels more performative than grounded. The tone is consistent with the genre but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent and moves well, with some strong imagery ("bleed through"). However, it relies on familiar phrasings ("chill down her spine," "held its breath") and some filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise combines standard ghost story tropes (the unfinished symphony, the skeptic protagonist) without a significantly fresh subversion. While the mechanic of water revealing the ink is a nice touch, the overall trajectory is predictable.</comment>
