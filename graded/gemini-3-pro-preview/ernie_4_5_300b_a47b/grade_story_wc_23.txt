<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara serves primarily as a functional vessel for the ritual, obeying instructions without internal conflict or hesitation. Her motivation is abstract ("geography of loss") and explicitly stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear instruction-execution loop ("do this" -> she does it) without complication or failure. The closure arrives as a neat completion of a checklist, lacking a sense of earned causality or protagonist agency navigating genuine obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The censer foot provides a strong, specific grounding object that anchors the fantasy elements. While atmospheric, some descriptors lean into generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("skeletal fingers," "rusted antennae") rather than fresh, specific observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a hard choice. The task proceeds smoothly to success, and the "solace" she feels during the work undermines potential tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is articulated directly in the text ("geography of loss") rather than emerging organically from the action. The resolution offers a tidy fulfillment of the premise without exploring the emotional cost or complexity of disturbing the dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The grandmother's dialogue acts as a functional plot device but lacks distinct character cadence beyond cryptic commands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent but relies on familiar phrasing ("heart racing," "ink-black sky") and filter verbs ("Mara knew"). The phrase "raw solace" reads as a slightly jarring oxymoron that feels inserted rather than earned by the scene's emotional reality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of "reverse migration" via radio signals is imaginative and offers a fresh take on ghost stories. However, the execution adheres to a safe, standard ritual-success structure that limits the ingenuity of the premise.</comment>
