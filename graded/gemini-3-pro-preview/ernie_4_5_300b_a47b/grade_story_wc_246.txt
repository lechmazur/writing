<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is clearly motivated by guilt, but his arc is reactive; he relies entirely on Lira to explain the moral lesson and the mechanics of resolution. The internal conflict—the urge to fix versus the need to accept—is resolved through instruction rather than a pressure-tested choice or failure in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a didactic intervention rather than causal action to resolve the plot. The closure—a girl’s fever breaking offline because Elias decided to apologize—reads as "symmetric satisfaction" or a magical reward for correct moral thinking, lacking a concrete causal link on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is established with vivid, sensory-specific imagery ("air like glass," "stones hung midair") that grounds the scene. The setting actively facilitates the "history as web" projection, integrating well with the core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high in theory (a girl's life), but the on-page tension is deflated by Lira, who functions as a safety valve providing the answers. Elias does not face a dilemma where he must sacrifice something tangible; he simply accepts a better philosophy, lowering the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue rather than subtext ("I edit the *why*. You edit the *what*"). The message is preached by the guide character, and the "fever broke" ending reinforces a tidy moral rather than exploring the complexity of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is competent and consistent, though Lira’s dialogue serves primarily as an exposition delivery system. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, but the "instructional" tone of the interaction flattens the distinctness of the voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with some strong descriptive beats ("prickled Elias’s skin"). However, the dialogue leans into abstraction and "told" emotion ("guilt gnawed at him") rather than showing these states through behavior.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "celestial signal interpreter" editing history is intriguing, but the execution falls into the "mysterious guide teaches protagonist to accept the past" trope. The resolution feels familiar and safe.</comment>
