<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on archetypal labels (militiaman, merchant, scholar) rather than specific, embodied personality. The transformation of the group is summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices, making the emotional arc feel unearned. Joren's resistance "cracking like dry leaves" is a metaphor that replaces necessary psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative fails the default scope of a continuous scene, functioning instead as a synopsis or montage spanning months. There is no specific causal chain of events; conflicts are resolved through summarized passage of time ("Across weeks blurring into months") rather than on-page action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but repetitive, relying heavily on the descriptor "velvet" (used four times) and generic autumn imagery. While the zither is described in detail, the library itself feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and resolved too easily via the teacher's method, with no felt cost or genuine risk of failure on the page. The antagonism between characters is stated in summary ("bellowed a defiant folk dirge") and then immediately smoothed over without a decisive tactical struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through didactic dialogue ("harmony isn't addition; it's excision") and heavy-handed narration. The resolution feels like a moral lesson rather than an emergent truth, lacking ambiguity or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stiff and visibly constrained by the forced insertion of prompt phrases, leading to awkward syntax. The repetition of "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" creates a robotic cadence that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Prose is marred by severe repetition of prompt phrases (loops) and misused vocabulary. "Across unlearning hatred" is used ungrammatically as a prepositional time-marker three times, and "denoted" is forced into contexts where it fits poorly, creating jarring artifacts that break immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The core concept of music healing social division is a familiar trope, and the execution offers no fresh twist or subversion. The reliance on summary and abstract archetypes prevents any unique specificities from emerging.</comment>
