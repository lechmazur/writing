<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is a collection of prompt labels rather than a person; traits like &quot;empathetically decisive&quot; are stated as adjectives rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or reluctance; she acts with perfect competence and faces no emotional cost. The characterization relies entirely on summary and assertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Causality is broken by the physical impossibility of constructing a 200-yard suspension bridge overnight with rope and planks, followed by an unearned utopian resolution where decades of ethnic strife vanish instantly upon hearing a song. The ending is a &quot;magic fix&quot; with no visible cost or sacrifice. The timeline leaps over the actual struggle to reach a tidy, frictionless conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting details are vivid but purely ornamental (&quot;hush of borrowed starlight&quot;), failing to ground the physical reality of the scene. The spatial logistics of the bridge construction are ignored in favor of romantic imagery. While the clock tower is established, the environment feels like a stage set for a fable rather than a lived-in place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The conflict evaporates immediately upon contact with the protagonist; there is no escalation, only a linear progression to success. The &quot;shouted accusations&quot; turn to laughter without any intermediate struggle or negotiation. The stakes are declared but never tested, as the solution works perfectly on the first try.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via sledgehammer moralizing (&quot;symbol of dropped weights lifting all&quot;), leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, resolving complex social issues with a simplistic, sentimental gesture. Resonance is killed by the overt didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly flowery and breathless, prioritizing purple phrases over clarity. Dialogue is stiff and functional, serving only to deliver the prompt's required multilingual element. The constant insertion of required phrases like &quot;vigorous tender&quot; disrupts the rhythm and breaks immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten and dense with adjectives (&quot;shadowy grain elevators rising like silent titans&quot;). The prompt phrase &quot;vigorous tender&quot; is pasted verbatim into the text four times, creating a clumsy repetitive artifact. Phrasing often feels strained (&quot;plummeting, plummeting star-glint&quot;) and melodramatic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story reads like a standard response to a list of constraints, stitching them together without internal logic or fresh insight. The &quot;healing power of song&quot; resolution is a tired cliché, executed here without any unique twist or emotional grounding.</comment>
