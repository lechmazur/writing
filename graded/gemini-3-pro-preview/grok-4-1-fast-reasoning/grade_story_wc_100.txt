<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("weary," "stubborn") rather than organic behavior. The prompt attribute "inadvertently stubborn" is inserted verbatim twice as a mechanical tag to force the plot, rather than functioning as an integrated trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "permanent address" goal with clear cost. However, the pivotal method—"occupying impossible spaces"—emerges abruptly from "desperation" without sufficient causal setup for an undertaker's established skillset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and specific, with details like "bioluminescent anemones" and "ruined aqueducts" grounding the fantasy. The physical reality of the drowned library actively constrains options and shapes the magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conflict is stable, with distress signals providing constant pressure that escalates logically. The final trade-off—sacrificing self for the silence of others—is a clear, earned cost paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The resolution offers a satisfying thematic inversion, transforming the undertaker into a beacon to solve the "permanent address" problem. The ending successfully reweights the protagonist's initial burden into a new form of service.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("swelled with eternal silence," "hesitant heartbeats"). Heavy adjectival layering distances the reader from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Craft is marred by clichés ("cracks mirroring the fractures in his spirit") and tautologies ("domed ceiling a cracked dome"). The verbatim repetition of "inadvertently stubborn" and "permanent address" creates drag and reads as unpolished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of an underwater library undertaker with a lighthouse mythos is evocative. While the "impossible spaces" concept is imaginative, its execution feels slightly derivative of convenient magic-system tropes.</comment>
