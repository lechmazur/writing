<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies on static labels ("reticent," "warmly observant") rather than dramatized behavior, resulting in stock types. The protagonist's arc is severed at the climax by the meta-textual breakdown ("Wait, recount precisely later"), preventing any earned emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure collapses completely in the final third, dissolving into drafting notes and error messages ("No—that exceeded..."). This failure prevents any functional closure, leaving the inciting incident and rising action without a resolved ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "Fresnel lens" and "sea glass" establish a concrete setting initially, though descriptors often lean toward melodrama ("dying heartbeat," "abyssal black"). The setting's coherence evaporates when the prose disintegrates into meta-commentary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Stakes regarding the failing light and the preservation of safety are established but abandoned for a meta-commentary on word count constraints. The tension dissolves without decision or cost, as the story fails to reach a narrative conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via heavy-handed exposition in the letter text ("Safety is the stone...") rather than emerging from subtext. The required tone phrase "luminescent ache" is inserted awkwardly, disrupting the thematic consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Narrative distance and suspension of disbelief are destroyed by the intrusion of authorial drafting instructions ("No, must hit 600-800") in the final paragraphs. The voice shifts jarringly from atmospheric fiction to mechanical error log.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>The text contains fatal drafting artifacts and self-correction logs ("Wait, writing properly," "Adjust," "Over"), rendering it unpublishable. The prose prior to the break is functional but laden with adjective-heavy constructions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The "message in a bottle" trope is familiar and not elevated here, relying on sentimental conventions. The execution failure prevents any unique synthesis of the lighthouse setting and the stone-stacking concept.</comment>
