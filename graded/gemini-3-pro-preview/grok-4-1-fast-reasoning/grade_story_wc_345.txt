<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on epithets ("callused hands," "haunted by loss") and group summary rather than dramatized behavior. The characters function as a monolithic unit ("The family") with no distinct internal lives or frictional dynamics on the page. The "doubt" expressed is resolved instantly without genuine interpersonal or internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a synopsis or montage rather than a scene, spanning "seasons" and "days" in rapid summary. The resolution is a "magic feather" ending where following instructions yields a total cure without complication or cost. There is no causal deepening; the ghost provides the solution, and the characters simply execute it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting contains vivid visual elements ("floating rock arches," "lavender skies") but feels largely like set dressing. The "deserted sidewalks" in the orchard offer a moment of intrigue, but the world physics (nebula descending to heal trees) function as abstract magic rather than a grounded environment affecting choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Conflict is nominal; "doubt" is mentioned in summary but dismissed in a single exchange of dialogue. There is no escalation of pressure; the path from problem to solution is linear and unobstructed. The stakes (planetary blight) are declared but the resolution feels unearned by protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly preached via the ghost's chalk messages ("Strangers no more..."), leaving no room for subtext. The narrative didacticism ("brambled hope," "bonds forged") flattens resonance into a moral lesson rather than an emergent property of the story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The voice is a distant, fable-like summary that tells the reader what to feel ("strangely trustworthy," "inexplicable faith"). Dialogue is sparse and functional, used largely to insert prompt phrases rather than to reveal character or advance the scene organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from purple metaphors ("doubt thorned their unity," "brambled hope stirred"). Key prompt phrases are inserted awkwardly, creating clunky rhythms ("strangely trustworthy" in dialogue). The density is low due to the reliance on summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The premise is a standard "heal the land" quest with a deus ex machina resolution. The execution follows a predictable path of instruction-following without subverting tropes or offering a fresh perspective on the survivor dynamic.</comment>
