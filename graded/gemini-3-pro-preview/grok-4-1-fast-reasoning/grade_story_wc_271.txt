<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characterization is undermined by the intrusion of diagnostic labels into interiority and dialogue ("somatic markers from some strike of life"). The protagonist’s transition from a trauma freeze to a wise mentor occurs too abruptly, relying on therapeutic exposition rather than earned emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The inciting incident relies on a heavy coincidence (finding the photo on the exact anniversary), and the resolution feels rushed. The shift from the internal freeze to the external mentorship lacks a dramatized middle beat where the cost of recovery is paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively contrasting the "fragile Eden" with the harsh cliffside. However, the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("suspended green world," "indifferently swaying ferns") that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pressure dissipates quickly; the protagonist resolves her PTSD episode through an instant epiphany ("pearl of stillness") rather than struggle. The interaction with the artist lacks genuine friction, serving only as a vehicle for the protagonist to deliver the thematic lesson.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its themes through dialogue and narration ("survival wasn't erasure but adaptation"), leaving little room for subtext. The final conversation functions as a moral summary rather than an organic interaction, triggering the thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is inconsistent, alternating between sensory immersion and clinical explanation of the prompt's terms. The dialogue is particularly unnatural, forcing prompt phrases ("quietly talented," "somatic markers") into spoken speech in a way that breaks immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from scaffold repetition ("pearl of stillness" appears three times) and adjective-heavy styling. The integration of required phrases is jarring, particularly the use of clinical terms in poetic contexts, creating a tonal clash.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the drone-strike wedding survivor context adds specificity, the "healing through gardening" arc follows a very standard trajectory. The execution feels formulaic, checking off prompt requirements rather than synthesizing them into a fresh narrative.</comment>
