<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal state is defined almost exclusively by the repeated label "bravely conflicted" rather than through embodied hesitation or nuanced thought. While the choice to act is clear, the emotional transition happens instantly ("action had chosen for her"), bypassing the struggle necessary to make the agency feel earned. The character functions more as a vehicle for the prompt words than a living entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The causal arc is functional, moving from the glitch to the decision to the broadcast, ending in a valid state of Charged Poise. However, the pacing is breathless, compressing a complex revolution into a "suspended blink" that strains credibility. The "dangerous liaison letter" functions as a convenient plot device available exactly when needed, smoothing over potential obstacles too easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sensory details of the frozen library—frost-rimed controls, breath fogging the air—create a solid visual grounding. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on the repetitive descriptor "dizzying quiet," which loses impact with each use. The setting constrains the action well, but the description feels somewhat static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high in theory (Regime collapse), but the on-page obstacle is minimal; the protagonist simply overrides safeguards with "intimate knowledge." The "cost" is anticipated (alarms will blare) rather than paid on the page, making the victory feel unearned. The conflict is resolved without significant tactical adjustment or sacrifice during the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and connection is present but delivered with heavy-handed literalism ("contraband truths," "unspoken conversation"). The narrative tells the reader the significance of events rather than allowing subtext to carry the weight. The forced repetition of prompt phrases disrupts thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice struggles to maintain immersion due to the awkward insertion of prompt labels ("scandalize the Regime," "bravely conflicted"). The tone is consistent but leans into purple prose ("surprise struck like a cracked pane") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Significant penalties for text artifacts and repetitive phrasing. Specific phrases—"dizzying quiet" (4x), "bravely conflicted" (3x), "scandalize" (3x), "contraband truths" (4x)—are looped to the point of distraction, breaking the narrative flow. The prose feels mechanically assembled around these required terms rather than organically written.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise of a lone guardian waking cryo-sleepers is a familiar trope executed here without a fresh twist or deepening of the standard formula. The execution is hampered by the checklist-style inclusion of prompt elements, preventing any unique voice or structural risk from emerging.</comment>
