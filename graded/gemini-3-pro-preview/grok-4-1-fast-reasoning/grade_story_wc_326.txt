<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Motivation is stated explicitly ("Her motivation burned quiet") rather than dramatized through action. The protagonist's internal state relies on repetitive labels like "death certificate error" and "midnight solace" instead of embodied emotion or psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Causality is broken by the central mechanic—fixing digital code by pouring physical ink—which lacks logical grounding even in a sci-fi context. A significant editing error ("static cleared... after the radio static cleared") disrupts the sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with heavy, ornamental description ("iridescent domes," "shimmering veins") that creates a visual backdrop but fails to exert pressure on the character. The environment is static rather than interactive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Stakes are low as the antagonist (the ghost) is cooperative and the resolution requires no sacrifice or difficult choice. The conflict is resolved through a convenient ritual rather than struggle or ingenuity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing dialogue ("failure taught humility") rather than emerging from the narrative. Subtext is absent, replaced by on-the-nose declarations of the character's lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is uneven, mixing high-flown poeticisms with clunky, meta-fictional phrasing ("glitching into midnight solace tones"). The perspective distance wavers, telling the reader what to feel rather than showing the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Severe line-level issues include a tautological editing error ("cleared after the radio static cleared") and nonsensical phrasing ("glitching into midnight solace tones"). The prose relies on abstraction ("Her attribute guided her") and repetitive keywords.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The story relies on familiar tropes (ghost in the machine, wise projection) without offering a fresh perspective or twisting the conventions. The "ink divination" mechanic is novel but executed without the necessary logic to make it credible.</comment>
