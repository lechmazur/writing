<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen functions as a standard "bored immortal" archetype without distinct personality traits or internal contradiction. His motivation is singular and meets no emotional resistance or doubt; he desires an end to ennui and pursues it linearly, lacking the "contradictory impulses acting in scene" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect path to a Decisive Change closure. However, the trajectory is frictionless; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or complications, making the "cost" of losing immortality feel like a simple transaction rather than a dramatic price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "prismatic escondite" is described through abstract sensory overload ("refracted light," "crystal lattices") rather than concrete, lived-in detail. The setting functions as a backdrop for the special effects of the climax but does not constrain the character's choices or offer tactical resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Tension is flat; Elowen dominates the conflict with the storm and "sentient voids" effortlessly. The dominant stake is abstract (boredom), and the protagonist achieves his goal without facing a moment of genuine jeopardy or a forced trade-off that narrows his options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in mortality is present but delivered through assertion rather than subtext. The resolution ("eternal in wonder's grip") is tidy and idealized, bypassing the complexity or ambiguity that characterizes higher-band thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently melodramatic and relies on heavy filtering ("He was dimensionally aware," "He perceived," "He felt") that distances the reader. The register is monotonous in its elevation, lacking the modulation needed to make the climax feel distinct from the setup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Prose is heavily laden with abstract "purple" metaphors ("bruised violets," "veins of liquid iron") that blur imagery. The prompt phrase "hushed thunder" repeats five times, creating a distracting loop artifact rather than a resonant motif, and modifier density impedes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a "spatial mutiny" offers a spark of novelty, but it is executed through familiar fantasy tropes of ascension and technobabble. The "bored immortal seeking death" premise is played straight without a fresh subversion or specific emotional grounding.</comment>
