<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theo is competent but static; his lack of fear ("felt no fear") and the ease with which he navigates the encounter drain potential tension. The "compulsion" is stated rather than dramatized through resistance or difficult choices, making him feel more like a function of the plot than a character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a convenient, late-introduced ability ("visions triggered by his gift") to deliver the backstory and solution, rather than earning it through investigation. The closure is neat and tidy ("ghosts finally clocked out"), lacking the "felt cost" required for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is established with sensory competence, particularly the lighting and dust, though it relies on some "abandoned circus" clichés ("faded big tops," "painted smiles"). The specific focus on the mainspring barrel grounds the scene effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are low; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or risk, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off. The ghost's plea is easily satisfied with a found key, resulting in a linear progression without meaningful tightening or reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit narration ("ghosts born from the betrayal of brittle appearances") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text explains the moral ("talisman against future façades") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "filtering" ("noting," "analyzing") that distances the reader. The narrative stance is confident, though it occasionally slips into melodramatic descriptors ("grating symphony").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is functional and clear but marred by abstract metaphors ("distant popcorn dreams") and tell-heavy phrasing ("skillfully observant"). The rhythm is steady, but the reliance on adjectives to carry atmosphere slows the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The conceit of an elevator technician is fresh, but the story quickly reverts to a standard "haunted circus" trope with a familiar resolution mechanism. The "hidden ascent" concept is metaphorical but feels like a missed opportunity for a more unique structural interaction.</comment>
