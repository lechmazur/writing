<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("orderly intuitive nature," "dual allegiance") rather than dramatized behavior. Internal conflict is summarized ("tore at her") but does not manifest in difficult on-page choices or hesitation. The protagonist's "shock absorber" role functions more as backstory exposition than an active, constrained skill in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The resolution relies on summary and convenient competence ("Insiders knew," "intuition foresaw") rather than causal mechanics. The ending dissolves into a montage ("Weeks passed"), diluting the immediate cost of the scene's climax. The "reorganization" happens too easily via off-page coordination, lowering narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid ("bioluminescent lanterns," "neon-lit frenzy") but often list-like. The setting feels like a static backdrop; the physical reality of the rafts (their weight, drift, connection) is described rather than felt through the character's interaction with the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Conflict is introduced but resolved with low resistance; the protagonist's intuition conveniently bypasses the antagonist's enforcers ("blind spots"). The stakes are high (eviction), but the victory feels unearned because the opposition never forces a painful trade-off or failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Themes are stated explicitly in the text ("dual allegiance," "hopeful desperation") rather than emerging from subtext. The story moralizes its conclusion ("reorganization had saved the spirit"), leaving no room for reader interpretation or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative distance is remote, summarizing large swathes of action ("Word spread like fireworks") instead of staying in the immediate scene. The voice leans toward purple prose ("kaleidoscope of costumes") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Prose suffers from frequent emotion labeling ("Hope flickered," "Hope surged") and abstract phrasing ("gritty essence," "ancestral warning"). Repetitive verbs ("bloomed" appears three times) and clunky adverbs ("intuitively," "stealthily") clutter the sentence rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The concept of a raft city resisting gentrification is serviceable but executed with standard tropes. The "graffiti as code" mechanic is inventive but treated magically rather than logically, limiting its ingenuity.</comment>
