<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc is resolved through summary ("Hours blurred") rather than dramatized struggle. Emotions are labeled ("guilt," "envy," "happiness surged") rather than embodied, and the "shadow" antagonist is defeated instantly by her default setting without forcing a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The climax relies on an unearned attribute activation ("levity was the key") that resolves the plot without prior setup of weight as a constraint. The middle section collapses into a montage, skipping the causal beats of the "shadow work" process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "recycled spaceship" offers some texture ("melted-down battlecruisers"), but the physics of a hologram manipulating physical objects (pearl, tapestry) are indistinct. The spatial blocking at the end (ascending then descending) is contradictory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared but not felt; the antagonist (the shadow) surrenders to the protagonist's first move (stitching) without inflicting damage or forcing adaptation. There is no visible cost to the victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("pacifist creed demanding integration," "peace stitched the stars") rather than subtext. The narrative didacticism flattens the complexity of the "shadow work" concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is elevated but suffers from repetitive phrasing to satisfy prompt requirements ("ghostly resolve" appears four times). The tone feels forced and artificial rather than organic to the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is marred by clumsy prompt insertions ("Via the faint shimmer...") and mixed metaphors ("sweat-like static"). The prose relies on abstract summary rather than concrete, sensory-driven action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels mechanical, treating the prompt list as a checklist rather than a coherent narrative ecosystem. The blend of sci-fi and spiritual fantasy lacks a fresh, unifying logic.</comment>
