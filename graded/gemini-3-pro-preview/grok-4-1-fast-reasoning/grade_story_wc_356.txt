<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, and the doodling habit adds specific character shading. However, the heavy use of summary ("Days blurred," "Weeks passed") prevents the dramatization of micro-choices and contradictory impulses within a specific high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story violates the 600–800 word scope default (single scene) by summarizing weeks of growth in a montage. This structural choice flattens the narrative arc, reducing the inciting incident and climax to generalized descriptions rather than immediate, time-bound events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, effectively using verticality and the "misty abyss" to ground the village. The sensory focus on smell is well-integrated with the protagonist's specific trait, though the "tide's thought" metaphor becomes repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the internal and external conflicts are linked, the montage structure dissipates the pressure. We are told of the struggle ("motion and smell converged in torment") rather than witnessing a specific, desperate choice that creates a visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The thematic resolution relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("serenity not as stillness, but poise within sway"). This explanation replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the lesson rather than letting the image speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but stumbles on clunky phrasing like "olfactorily sensitive nose" (a redundancy) and "journalize" (an awkward verb). These slips distract from the otherwise atmospheric tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Redundant phrasing ("olfactorily sensitive nose") and mechanical repetition of prompt terms ("wildflower hush," "tide's thought") create a checklist feel. The prose suffers from adjective stacking that slows momentum without adding precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of a treetop village and a corpse flower is distinct, but the execution follows a standard "nature teaches epiphany" template. The "doodling on refuse" element adds a spark of freshness.</comment>
