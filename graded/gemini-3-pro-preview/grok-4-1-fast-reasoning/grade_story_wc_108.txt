<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies on resume-style summary and explicit labels ("stunt double," "firmly adaptive") rather than dramatized choice. The inclusion of meta-commentary preventing any immersion in the character's interiority or genuine emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure collapses due to the inclusion of drafting notes ("No—word count overrun," "Actually:"), which breaks causality and prevents a coherent timeline. The ending is a series of conflicting options rather than a resolved closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The setting is established through heavy adjectival description ("rusted," "roiling," "warped") rather than character interaction or constraint. The environment functions as a static backdrop for the summary rather than a lived-in space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved by authorial fiat and magical convenience (the shell decoding the cast) rather than character agency. The climax is undermined by the text rewriting itself on the page, negating any accumulation of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly announced ("vulnerability was power") as a thesis statement multiple times rather than emerging from subtext. The result is a lecture-like summary without earned emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>1.0</grade><comment>The voice is that of an outlining author rather than a narrative focalizer, explicitly breaking the fourth wall with editing instructions ("wait, cap"). This failure of distance control destroys narrative authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>The prose is melodramatic summary ("quaked with terrors," "vessel for stars' daring") interspersed with raw drafting artifacts. The text fails to dramatize scenes, relying entirely on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The execution is a meta-outline rather than a story, and the specific combination of elements (a seashell decoding a plaster cast) feels forced and logically incoherent. The prompt elements are pasted together without organic synthesis.</comment>
