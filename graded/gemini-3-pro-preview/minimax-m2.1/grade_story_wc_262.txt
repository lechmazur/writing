<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira functions primarily as a passive camera for the backstory rather than an active protagonist. Her interiority relies on abstract summaries of her "gift" rather than embodied emotion or struggle, and her final choice to leave the reel feels low-stakes and pre-ordained rather than a hard-won renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc suitable for a vignette, effectively gathering emotional weight to a legible moment of closure (Earned Stasis). However, the progression is linear and lacks causal turns or complications; the "mystery" is solved instantly by magic, reducing narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting of the projection booth is atmospheric and sensory, with details like "rotting seats" and "shattered glass" grounding the scene well. The physical space effectively mirrors the internal theme of decay and preservation, though some descriptions tilt toward abstract "emotional architectures" over concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>External pressure is virtually nonexistent; there is no time limit, antagonist, or physical obstacle, leaving the stakes entirely abstract. The escalation relies solely on the clarifying vision, and the protagonist faces no significant trade-offs or risks until the final, relatively easy decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of "unfinished endings" is coherent but delivered through didactic exposition ("Some goodbyes need no audience...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The narrative explicitly tells the reader what the story means in the final paragraphs, flattening the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately moody, but suffers from "prompt-worditis" where required phrases like "spatially imaginative" are inserted awkwardly as labels. The tone struggles to balance the necessary lyrical quality with natural narrative flow, occasionally feeling stiff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose leans heavily into purple metaphors ("quiet violence of hushed thunder," "patient as thunder learning to speak softly") that obscure meaning. Several phrases are repeated within the short word count ("spatially imaginative," "incubate"), creating a sense of redundancy and scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The concept of a psychic reading emotions from an object in an abandoned theater is a familiar trope. While the twist of the "letters" being unspoken intentions is nice, the execution follows a standard, safe path without subverting expectations.</comment>
