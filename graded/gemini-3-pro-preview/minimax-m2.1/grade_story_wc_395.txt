<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren is defined primarily by her job title and the repeated label "brightly attentive," which functions more as a plot device than a character trait tested under pressure. Her internal conflict regarding the restoration of the file is stated but resolved quickly without visible emotional struggle or cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The investigation proceeds linearly with minimal resistance; the narrative bypasses the central obstacle ("corporate firewalls that should have been impenetrable") in a single sentence without dramatized effort. While the closure suggests a shift in stance, the lack of causal friction in the middle reduces the earned weight of the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the server farm "humming with the echo of forgotten songs" effectively ground the story in a melancholic, digital tone. Specific anchors like the Prometheus patch and the recurring "47" provide necessary texture, though the environment feels static rather than interactive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; the corporate antagonist is passive, represented only by old deletion logs rather than active opposition. The "impenetrable" firewalls offer no actual resistance, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the protagonist's success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of digital persistence and corporate erasure is coherent and resonant, fitting the "sensed absence" prompt well. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat familiar trope of distributed consciousness without subverting expectations or deepening the concept beyond its initial premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable melancholic register ("particular silence," "digital residue"). The point of view remains stable, though the reliance on the "brightly attentive" tag to explain Maren's insights flattens the distinctiveness of her perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but relies on "telling" shortcuts at pivotal moments (e.g., "Maren's brightly attentive nature told her..."). The repetition of the specific phrase "brightly attentive" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic, and the firewall bypass lacks the granular detail needed to sell the feat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost in the machine communicating through code/songs is a well-trodden sci-fi trope. While executed competently, the story follows a predictable procedural path without a fresh twist or unique specific synthesis to distinguish it from standard genre fare.</comment>
