<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character motivation relies heavily on diagnostic self-awareness ("innocence about the world's indifference") rather than embodied struggle. The interiority feels intellectualized and static, presenting a thesis on trauma rather than a lived experience of it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a static vignette of reflection with minimal present-tense causal movement. The climax involves speaking to the air, which feels like a low-stakes ritual rather than a pressure-driven turning point; the reflection ratio is high, slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but leans on generic "literary trauma" imagery (blackened stumps, moonlit ridge). The "new saplings pushing through ash" seven years later is a functional if slightly cliché visual anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Immediate scene stakes are low; the conflict is entirely retrospective, resolved years ago, and merely commemorated here. There is no active obstacle or escalation in the present moment to force a new choice or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized ("The fire doesn't care... But we do"). The ending relies on a summarizing moral ("transform her burning into someone else's light") that flattens subtext into an essayistic conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overwrought, often merging the character's perspective with authorial summation. The tone feels overly polished and melodramatic ("terrible beauty of controlled burns") for the grounded reality of the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high and occasionally mixed ("landscape of her survival mapping itself"). A visible redundancy artifact appears in the middle ("splitting its light into fragments that scattered... like scattered memories"), and abstract phrasing often displaces concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise of a survivor returning to the site of trauma to commune with a ghost is a familiar trope. The execution follows a standard pattern without a fresh structural or conceptual turn to distinguish it.</comment>
