<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elira is a capable focalizer, and her internal landscape is successfully filtered through the "softened" anesthetic state. However, the key trait "shrewdly innocent" is established via summary exposition rather than dramatized through a pressured choice, and the emotional connection with the child relies on shorthand ("touch said everything") rather than unique, earned interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving effectively from the doctor's request to the decoding and finally to a resonant closure. The ending—Elira deciding to return the cast—qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt sense of witness, though the "anesthetic" frame slightly dampens the urgency of the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium" creates a cohesive, atmospheric envelope that mirrors the protagonist's drugged, recovering state. The sensory details are specific and grounded, particularly the "brain coral" which functions as a tactile object-as-setting that reinforces the theme of calcified trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes of recovering the child's story are clear and emotionally resonant, providing a sufficient "deepening" for this length. However, the conflict is low-resistance; the decoding process proceeds smoothly without external obstacles or significant risk of failure, keeping the pressure relatively static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "translating silence into testimony" is poignant and well-integrated into the central action of reading the cast. While the narrative occasionally leans into explicit thematic statements ("This was the work she had always done"), the final image successfully anchors the concept in a concrete object.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, effectively managing the "dreamlike" quality without losing clarity. The shift to interpreting the child's drawings is handled with a steady hand, maintaining the single POV while allowing the child's experience to surface.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and meets the "literary" tone requirement with strong phrasing like "vernacular of shrapnel." There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("eternal, misty embrace," "lotus-hearted and ancient") that threatens to overcrowd the imagery, but the line-level rhythm remains propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conceit—treating a plaster cast as a palimpsest of war trauma to be translated—is highly inventive and reframes the "translator" prompt with fresh specificity. This creative choice elevates a standard hospital recovery scene into something memorable and distinct.</comment>
