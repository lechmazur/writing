<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and consistent, effectively grounding the summoner's perspective. However, the pivotal realization—that prophecy is frequency—feels asserted as an intellectual epiphany ("She understood now...") rather than earned through visceral struggle or on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of prophecy as warning) lands effectively. The progression is somewhat linear and low-friction, relying more on meditative procedural steps than causal complications.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the brook and origami wing serving as effective anchors for the ritual. The sensory details ("ghost-motes," "water whispered") establish a strong, albeit slightly stylized, mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are high in concept (unmaking fate) but the on-page conflict is low-pressure and purely internal. The resolution comes through a shift in perception rather than a hard trade-off, making the "hush" feel relatively safe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of agency versus destiny is well-integrated with the magic system. The twist of the prophecy being a self-warning adds decent resonance, though the thematic thesis is stated somewhat explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent lyrical quality. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with dense metaphorical stacking ("braille made of absence") that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of the distinctive phrase "tranquil blaze," which draws attention to itself. The prompt phrase "terrestrially cosmic truth" is inserted awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm with adjective clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of "smoothing" prophecy as if it were noise/frequency is a fresh, sci-fi-adjacent take on a fantasy trope. The execution is solid, though the "solitary ritual by a stream" setup is a familiar tableau.</comment>
