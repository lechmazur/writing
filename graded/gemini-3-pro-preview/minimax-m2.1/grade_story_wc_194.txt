<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation relies heavily on passive compulsion ("drawn... as though magnetised") rather than active agency. While the internal conflict regarding her heritage is established, the narrative is severed mid-sentence, preventing any assessment of the final choice, reaction, or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The story terminates mid-sentence ("that had echoe"), resulting in a total absence of closure and failing the prompt's requirement for a complete narrative. This fatal structural flaw renders the drive lens invalid and leaves the central causal chain unresolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "sepia reading room" is realized with vivid, specific sensory details like the "scent of paper, leather, and something faintly sweet." These elements effectively constrain the action and establish a cohesive, if somewhat generic, gothic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes regarding the estate and family history are established, and pressure escalates appropriately through the discovery of the machine. However, the abrupt cutoff eliminates the climax and resolution, leaving the conflict unaddressed and the price of the revelation unpaid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Themes of lineage and memory are stated ("accumulated weight of a family") but lack a concluding resonance due to the missing ending. The concept of "truth... as recognition" is introduced late and severed before it can meaningfully reweight the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("weaving chaos through the bones of order"). The tonal shift from gothic reminiscence to the pseudo-science of "standing waves" is handled reasonably well, though the incompleteness disrupts the final effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent but suffers from overwriting ("eloquently silent of secrets" is grammatically awkward). The text ending mid-word ("echoe") is a disqualifying production error that ruins line-level integrity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise of a reluctant heir discovering a family secret in a dusty manor is a derivative trope. While the "standing wave" mechanism adds a minor fresh angle, the execution follows a predictable path until the abrupt stop prevents any potential twist.</comment>
