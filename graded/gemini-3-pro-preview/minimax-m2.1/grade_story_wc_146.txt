<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eliorn is a capable and consistent protagonist whose esoteric expertise is well-rendered. However, her internal landscape is relatively static; she faces physical endurance rather than a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. The trait "cryptic" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through interaction, limiting its impact on the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure fits the concept of resonance perfectly, using repetition to build density and weight. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the stones finally respond—is earned and distinct. The causal link between the footfalls and the revival is established early and paid off clearly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, with the ancient archway functioning as a specific tool ("tuning peg") rather than just a backdrop. Sensory details like the "moss worn to velvet" and the "buzz" in the boot soles create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that grounds the magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily man-versus-entropy, which works for the tone but lacks sharp active pressure or a dynamic antagonist. The escalation is well-handled through the physical toll (aching legs, warming fork), though the stakes feel somewhat theoretical until the stones respond.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of resonance serves as a strong unification of mechanics and meaning, treating community health as a frequency. The story successfully avoids being preachy, allowing the "wound in the landscape" to speak to interdependence through the specific action of the tuning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("wild hush," "marrow"). There is a slight reliance on filtering verbs ("Eliorn understood," "She felt") that creates distance, but the mythic tone generally supports the pacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical with high information density. Phrasing like "footfall a question posed to the sleeping stone" is excellent. Minor botanical confusion between "ironwood tree" and "ebony fork" (unless referring to color) is a negligible flaw in a fantasy context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of healing a city through acoustic resonance and walking patterns is a fresh, imaginative take on the "ghost town" and "healer" tropes. The execution feels specific and earned rather than generic.</comment>
