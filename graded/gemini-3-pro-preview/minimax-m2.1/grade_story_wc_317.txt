<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's internal transformation is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told she shifts her design philosophy, but we do not see the specific moment of struggle or choice that earns this change. The commercial pressure is declared as backstory but never manifests as an on-page antagonist or obstacle forcing a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Days passed into weeks... months turned") rather than a specific scene, violating the scope defaults and diluting immediate tension. The climax is a realized concept within summary narration rather than a dramatized event, leaving the causality of the change feeling abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "moonlight fracture" and the imagined "scent of rotting flesh" are vivid and effectively set the mood. However, the setting lacks immediate constriction; the brook and porch serve more as a backdrop for reflection than as an environment that forces tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The conflict between artistic integrity and commercial demand is abstract; without an on-page deadline, critic, or investor to force a decision, the stakes remain theoretical. The resolution arrives through the passive passage of time rather than active agency against resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit explanation ("She began to understand that the corpse flower... was a teacher") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story interprets its own symbols for the reader, reducing the potential for genuine resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical ("origami nightmares," "small revelation"), maintaining a polished literary tone. However, the narration tends toward "telling" internal states ("She was notably receptive"), which distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and evocative imagery; phrases like "wrinkled like a secret kept too long" land well. The rhythm is controlled, though the reliance on summary prevents the dynamic variation that comes from dialogue or active scene work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of escape room design with botanical patience is a fresh concept that elevates the premise. However, the execution falls into the familiar "epiphany via nature" trope without subverting expectations in the narrative arc itself.</comment>
