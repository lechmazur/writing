<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a static archetype of wisdom rather than a dramatic character, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She faces no difficult choices and undergoes no change or costly endurance; her "flaws" are presented as misunderstood virtues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a vignette/portrait rather than a story, lacking a causal chain or accumulative pressure that leads to a necessary resolution. The ending is a return to routine without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric grounding in the harbor is vivid and sensory, establishing a strong mood. However, the setting remains largely ornamental, serving as a backdrop for contemplation rather than a source of constraint or pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are virtually nonexistent; there is no obstacle to the protagonist's desires and no risk of failure. The transition to the workday is a chronological inevitability rather than a result of agency, struggle, or tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("She understands that her work is not really about glass...") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on summary and moralizing prevents earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a controlled, meditative tone appropriate for the character. The psychic distance is stable, though somewhat remote, filtering the world through a lens of settled wisdom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" abstraction ("noctilucent reckonings," "scripture") and occasional clichés ("holds its breath," "mirror"). Explanatory telling dilutes the impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The "wise artisan finding magic in the mundane" is a familiar trope executed here without subversion or fresh specificity. The stone-in-pond metaphor is standard, offering no non-obvious synthesis or risk.</comment>
