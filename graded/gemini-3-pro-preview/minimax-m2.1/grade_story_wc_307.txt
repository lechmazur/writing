<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mina functions primarily as a receptive vessel for wisdom rather than a driver of conflict; her internal state is described through summary ("felt something shift") rather than embodied struggle. The Researcher is a strong archetypal presence, but the dynamic relies on traditional mentor-student tropes without subverting them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and effective within fable logic, moving cleanly from the stone's toss to the ripple's arrival. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the cost of the lesson (a lifetime of study), fulfilling the genre's requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "floating rock" and "pond caught the starlight" effectively ground the metaphysical stakes. However, some descriptors lean into abstraction ("smooth as worry") that slightly blurs the physical reality of the objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The conflict is low-pressure and meditative, focusing on patience versus ignorance. While the cost is conceptually high (spending a lifetime learning), the lack of active resistance or on-page struggle limits the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly in dialogue ("revelation unearned is revelation lost"), which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language. This directness flattens the subtext and reduces the interpretative space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mythic, fable-like voice is consistent and confident, suiting the subject matter well. The narrative distance is appropriate, maintaining a reverent tone that supports the "delayed revelation" structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic ("drifting in the mountain wind"), but occasionally reaches for poetic gravity with mixed results ("eyes held the brightness of someone who had not yet learned to weep"). The "smooth as worry" simile is an artifact that feels strained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "vanishing" as a form of legacy/appearing is a clever conceptual turn that elevates the standard "wise man on a mountain" setup. The backwards-aging element adds a nice layer of visual interest to the cycle of teaching.</comment>
