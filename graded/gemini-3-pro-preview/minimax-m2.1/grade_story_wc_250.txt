<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal state is delivered almost exclusively through summary and abstract wisdom ("She understood," "She had learned") rather than active, contradictory thought in the moment. The emotional calibration is too perfect; she functions as an idealized archetype without the internal friction or embodied messiness required for higher bands. The backstory (fever/voice) feels like a convenient shorthand rather than a lived trauma shaping a difficult choice in the present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece functions well as a "shard" under a Textural/Accumulative drive lens, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("stillwater tension"). Orientation is clear, and the dental mirror provides a solid causal anchor for the action. However, the narrative arc is extremely linear with minimal complication—the connection forms smoothly without the "tightening" or risk of failure that creates stronger narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The specific use of the dental mirror and warehouse shutters to create patterns effectively constrains the protagonist's method, grounding the scene. However, setting descriptions often drift into abstraction ("frequency of unspoken longing") rather than sticking to concrete sensory details that enforce the reality of the dock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the stakes (implied suicide/despair) are high, the on-page conflict is low; the boy offers no resistance to the guardian's intervention, making the success feel inevitable rather than earned. The scene lacks a moment where the method fails or the cost of the "half-spoken secret" forces a difficult tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("This was her purpose now... to teach darkness the value of stars") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This overt moralizing and the explanatory narration of the subtext ("She understood that being seen in suffering mattered") trigger the Thematic Echo penalty, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," explaining the significance of every gesture ("giving him the gift of witnessed solitude") instead of trusting the reader to infer it. The tone is cohesive but leans into a solemn, elevated register that distances the reader from the raw immediacy of the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns (grief, longing, truth, meaning, trust) and repetitive sentence stems ("She understood," "She had learned," "She knew"), creating a filter-verb stack that dulls immediacy. The phrase "spiralingly calm" is an awkward adverbial construction that disrupts the rhythm, and the density of "tell" over "show" reduces impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The use of a dental mirror to reflect light is a specific, inventive detail that elevates the premise. However, the core narrative of a mute, wise healer soothing a troubled soul via a perfect, magical connection is a familiar trope executed here with conventional sentimentality rather than a fresh, subversive angle.</comment>
