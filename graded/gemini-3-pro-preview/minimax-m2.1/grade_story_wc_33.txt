<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus is consistent, but the boy functions as a thematic prop rather than a genuine child. The dialogue ("You foster things by linking what's missing") is unnatural ventriloquism, where a character explicitly articulates the author's theme rather than speaking from their own limited perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly as Marcus redefines his role. The pacing is steady, though the transition to the reflection beat feels slightly mechanical and standard for the genre.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "cobalt arcade" is a vivid, constraining micro-setting that grounds the abstract border conflict in specific sensory details (tinted glass, claw machines). This specificity effectively anchors the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>External stakes are high (medicine for a dying relative), but internal conflict is absent; Marcus decides instantly without weighing the risk. The tightening (boy has no money) is functional, but the lack of reluctance or struggle flattens the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly explains its own subtext ("healing required medicine and metaphor in equal measure") and moralizes in the final paragraph. This didactic approach collapses ambiguity and leaves the reader with a lecture rather than an experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent but leans into poetic abstraction ("fragments of lives") and melodrama. The voice distance is controlled, but the reliance on sentimental phrasing softens the impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically sound but marred by significant clichés ("eyes too old for his face," "spreading... like dawn"). These stock phrases reduce the specific texture of the world to generic literary markers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mailman in a sci-fi/magical realism border arcade is distinct and promising. However, the execution follows a safe, sentimental "good samaritan" template without subverting expectations.</comment>
