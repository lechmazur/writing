<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is distinct, blending professional discipline with fresh grief in a way that motivates the shift from safety to risk. The choice to use the "old method" is a strongly embodied micro-choice that dramatizes her internal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed with clear causality: the failure of the search drives the need for a new approach, leading to the repair and subsequent revelation. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of her relationship to her brother's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The foundry setting is vivid and tactile, with details like "steady percussion" and "brass pans collecting rainwater" effectively grounding the mystical elements. The environment actively constraints the action, providing the tools (forge, gold) necessary for the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Internal pressure is high, effectively pitting Maren’s history of caution against the immediate need to understand her brother's risky path. The repair sequence serves as a strong escalation of this conflict, though the external stakes remain relatively contained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of "healing through visible damage" is well-integrated into the action, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("carry this truth forward..."), which flattens the resonance and triggers the penalty for sermonizing endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone that suits the alchemist protagonist. The distance is well-calibrated, allowing for deep reflection without stalling the physical scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and sensory imagery, though specific phrases like "factually mystical" and "luminous regret" feel forced and slightly disrupt the flow. These artifacts detract slightly from an otherwise high-quality execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi provides a coherent frame for the story, though the "broken object repaired to heal grief" trope is familiar. The execution is competent, but the conceptual risk is moderate.</comment>
