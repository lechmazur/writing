<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Miriam’s professional competence and obsession are rendered with excellent specific interiority. The choice to trust her interpretation over the "atlas community" provides a solid backbone, though the immediate emotional cost of the discovery is more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean causal line from the falcon's arrival to the decoding of the message. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing of the landscape, though the falcon's precise success feels slightly convenient without on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The outpost is vivid and integral; the condensation on the glass serves as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains Miriam's worldview and charges the final image. Capped at 8.8 per the global gate rules (Q2 &lt; 9.0).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high for the character's career, but the on-page pressure is quiet and intellectual rather than urgent or antagonistic. The escalation relies on observation and interpretation rather than active confrontation or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of origin, translation, and the legibility of the world cohere beautifully. The motif of "learning the language" of the landscape integrates perfectly with the plot mechanics of the phrasebook and map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly suited to the protagonist’s analytical nature. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly inside Miriam’s interpretive framework.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery; the "frost on the window" line is particularly strong. The rhythm supports the contemplative tone without dragging, though a few phrases (ghosts in walls) lean toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of falconry, linguistics, and cartography creates a fresh and specific scholar-explorer aesthetic. The concept of using condensation patterns to read topography adds a unique layer of ingenuity.</comment>
