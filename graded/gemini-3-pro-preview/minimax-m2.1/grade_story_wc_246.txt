<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira is a competent focalizer, but her interiority leans heavily on diagnostic labels ("confidently uncertain," "haunted her corridors") rather than embodied reaction to immediate pressure. The central conflict is resolved largely through summary and pre-existing competence, leaving her character arc feeling static and lacking a decisive, costly on-page transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear accumulation of effort without significant setbacks or tactical pivots; the solution arrives via a "time montage" ("For two hours, she traced...") rather than a dramatized causal struggle. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (validating the "wrong turn"), but the lack of resistance from the anomaly makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, using sensory precision ("amber light," "universe breathe") to ground abstract signal processing in a tangible atmosphere. The gravitational anomaly effectively creates a "bent" reality that mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the "origami" metaphor borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are dampened by Mira's established "strange comfort" with her situation; she begins and ends in a state of relative safety. The escalation relies on internal assertion rather than external pressure, and the "warm pen" functions as a subjective indicator of success rather than a forcing function for a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of repurposing failure ("wrong turn was a form of filtering") is coherent but delivered through explicit essayistic summary in the final paragraph. Subtext is occasionally crowded out by these direct authorial statements, reducing the resonant power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the contemplative tone, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory with phrases like "haunted her corridors of thought," which distances the reader from the raw data of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with good rhythmic variety, but suffers from mixed metaphors (gardening "seeds" vs. signal processing "threshing" vs. "origami") that muddy the conceptual logic. Stock phrases like "corridors of thought" and the cliché of the tool "growing warm" detract from the otherwise sharp imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise relies on the familiar "lonely outpost/analog superiority" trope without subverting it or adding a fresh conceptual layer beyond the specific "unbending" method. While executed competently, the narrative safety limits the sense of ingenuity or risk.</comment>
