<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s internal life is consistent, and the micro-choice to pry the goggles is successfully motivated by her established nature. The transition from curiosity to empathetic burden is earned, though the "warmly inquisitive" trait is told via label before being dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The elevator ascent provides a strong structural container that aligns temporal pressure with narrative pacing. However, the "childlike" cipher resolves the central obstacle too conveniently, reducing causal friction and making the middle beat feel unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like the fracturing sunlight and brass fittings effectively ground the scene in a specific atmosphere. The vertical movement is well-integrated with the internal revelation, using the setting to mirror the rising enlightenment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal conflict is legible and the ending establishes a valid felt cost in the weight of the secret. However, the external stakes remain low as the cipher offers no resistance, missing an opportunity for a harder trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme is coherent, but the character explicitly articulating the thesis ("joy beneath anguish") using prompt language near the end triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. This flattens the subtext into a summary statement rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and fits the atmospheric setting well, maintaining a consistent register. POV remains stable with Mira, efficiently filtering the world through her specific servant-class perspective and history.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is generally good but marred by repetitive verbs ("elevator groaned" appears twice) and stock phrasing ("of their own accord," "thousand fragments"). These artifacts dull the otherwise polished tone and reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "servant finding master's secret" trope is executed competently but offers little structural or conceptual novelty. The emotional beat is tender, but the setup feels familiar and the trajectory is predictable.</comment>
