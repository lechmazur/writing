<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s internal state is vividly rendered, blending physical sensation with trauma response effectively. However, her reflection relies heavily on abstract labels ("shame," "complicity") rather than dramatized memory in spots, and the self-diagnosis of her "special" nature borders on explanatory rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens holds well, moving from disorientation to a decisive stance (keeping the mask). The closure lands as a clear Charged Poise, where the choice to walk toward the unknown clearing creates a resonant, high-cost ending state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "ultraviolet forest" is established with visceral, sensory specificity that enhances the mood of alienation. The description of colors "between what eyes were meant to see and what they could survive" effectively grounds the surreal setting in the protagonist's physical danger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal but escalates cleanly as Mira transforms the mask from a restraint into a beacon. The decision to embrace "devastation" rather than numbness is a meaningful deepening of stakes with a felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is potent but over-articulated. The text explicitly defines the "mathematics of mercy" and its lesson ("did not live in answers but in the questions themselves"), which flattens the subtext into a stated thesis rather than letting the final image carry the resonance alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a somber, elevated tone that matches the gravity of the situation. The transition from physical sensation to philosophical realization is handled smoothly within the single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong and rhythmic ("dissolved like sugar in rain"), though the phrase "proprioceptively enhanced" is clunky and repetitive. Some sentences carry a slight heaviness from abstract noun density ("arithmetic of her wounds") that slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of torture recovery with a surreal, ultraviolet purgatory offers a fresh angle on the "escape" trope. The concept of the "mathematics of mercy" is intriguing, even if slightly overwrought in execution.</comment>
