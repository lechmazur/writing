<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a highly competent protagonist with a distinct, embodied connection to her environment. However, she faces no genuine internal conflict or doubt; her victory is linear and inevitable, lacking the "felt cost" or difficult choice required for higher bands. The characterization leans toward idealized competence rather than human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is sound, with clear orientation and setup, but the climax is summarized ("By midnight, she had guided...") rather than dramatized. We are told of the struggle rather than shown the specific obstacles of the evacuation, which lowers the narrative tension significantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is excellent—tactile, specific, and functionally constraining (acoustics, materials, geography). The environment actively shapes the protagonist's tactics and the plot's possibilities, bordering on 9-band integration but held back slightly by the summary nature of the maze navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are established early, but the conflict resolves too cleanly. The antagonist (Captain Reyes) concedes immediately and completely without further complication, and the central struggle (the evacuation) happens off-page. The lack of a "dark night" moment or on-page reversal flattens the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily explicated in the final paragraph ("In a world that worshipped technology..."). This overt moralizing replaces earned resonance with a sermonizing summary, triggering the penalty for explicit theme statements at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately atmospheric. The POV remains stable with Mira's perception coloring the narrative effectively (e.g., the map metaphor). Control of distance is strong throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("groaned in fog," "softened to cloth"). It occasionally leans into rhetorical flourish ("architecture of trust," "mycelium through soil") that feels slightly overwritten, but line-level craft is generally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "container labyrinth" concept and "whisper network" are engaging and well-synthesized. While the "tech fails, old ways win" trope is familiar, the specific execution within the port setting adds freshness, though the tidy resolution limits the sense of risk.</comment>
