<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation transitions organically from mundane necessity (sugar) to existential hunger (learning the building's language). Elena’s internal conflict—curiosity versus the preservation of a delicate friendship—resolves in a decisive, embodied micro-choice (touching the hand) that cements the relationship’s terms. The tutor’s portrayal balances "nimble" presence with the weight of being "dead," avoiding spectral clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a domestic inciting incident to a cosmic climax (meteor shower) that acts as a crucible for the truth. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to embrace the "agreed-upon lies" provides a satisfying, costly resolution that recontextualizes the entire relationship. The pacing perfectly mirrors the deepening intimacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary language of the story; the "syntax of sagging beams" and "groaning pipes" actively shape Elena’s understanding of her tutor. The environment participates in the climax—buildings "leaning inward" and "exhaling"—charging the final image with immense atmospheric pressure. Specific details like the "circular impression of a desk seal" anchor the magical elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central stake—the trade-off between knowing the objective truth and maintaining a profound connection—is escalated clearly through the "interrogation" scene. The pressure builds effectively as Elena pieces together the tutor's nature, culminating in a moment where she must choose between exposing the ghost or accepting the "membrane" of fiction. The cost of this choice is felt, though the conflict remains relatively quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "agreed-upon lies" as the mortar of human (and non-human) connection is woven masterfully through the narrative. The story treats the architecture of buildings and the architecture of relationships as parallel structures, achieving deep resonance without becoming didactic. The ending reframes the "lie" not as deceit, but as a necessary space for existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elena’s expanding perception. The shift from the mundane to the metaphysical is handled with a steady hand, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout. The tone manages to be eerie yet warm, a difficult balance executed well here.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "eyes the color of old mortar" and stars as "corrections written in the margins." While a few phrases border on the aphoristic ("older perhaps than the concept of buildings"), the rhythm and syntax largely support the magical realist tone. The text remains clean of loops and maintains strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, specific synthesis of the ghost story and architectural metaphors. The concept of a tutor for "dead languages" turning out to be a tutor of the building's own memory is an ingenious twist on the prompt. It feels complete and emotionally specific, avoiding generic tropes of haunting.</comment>
