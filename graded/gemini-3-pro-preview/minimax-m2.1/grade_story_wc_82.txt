<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a strongly realized focalizer with deep interiority and a consistent emotional baseline of grief. While her motivation (endurance/memorial) is clear, her agency is expressed primarily through ritual maintenance (Earned Stasis) rather than dynamic choice-making, which limits the dramatic range in a short scope. The characterization is vivid but static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece functions as a polished vignette under an Accumulative lens, effectively using the "Earned Stasis" closure model where the cost is the ongoing "luminous torment." The structure relies heavily on reflective exposition (BRR) anchored by the polishing action. While the closure is conceptually resonant, the narrative arc is internal and retrospective rather than driven by present-tense causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and specific, using the "floating island tea garden" and "cloud-sea" to physically ground the abstract emotional state. The sensory details ("shards of violet," "leaves still steaming") are purposeful, framing the protagonist's isolation and craft with high fidelity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are deeply personal and the pressure of grief is constant, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the scene lacks sharp escalation or a distinct tightening of options; the climax (viewing the dream) is a moment of confirmation rather than a shift in the conflict structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thematic integration is exceptional; the mechanics of the lantern craft perfectly mirror the processing of grief. The ending serves as a Conceptual Repricing ("learned to call the building of them craft"), offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central loss that recharges the crane motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately melancholic, managing the close third-person perspective without slippage. The tone modulates well between the technical details of the craft and the raw emotional undercurrents, maintaining consistency throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is high-quality with strong information density and vivid imagery ("stirring inside it like a fish beneath ice"). The rhythm supports the meditative pacing. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival density ("insidious," "constant," "luminous"), but it suits the established tone without creating drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of fantasy elements—dream recording, detached shadows, and celestial geography—feels fresh and emotionally specific. The "lanterns for the dead" concept transforms a familiar grief trope into a unique craft-based magic system.</comment>
