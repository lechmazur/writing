<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc from revolutionary purity to curatorial complexity is compelling and deeply woven into the narrative. The tension between her past and present drives the scene, culminating in a choice that feels earned by her specific history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The single-scene structure effectively uses the storm as a pressure cooker to force the climax. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview, though the explicit thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph ("truth mattered less...") slightly over-explains the realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; "visible time" pooling like honey and the mirror mechanics act as constraints that shape the protagonist's physical actions. The shard of vase serves as an excellent tactile anchor that grounds the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The approaching storm provides clear, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist's movements and final risk-taking. The physical stakes (madness via temporal dissonance) effectively weight the choice to look into the mirror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of historical complexity ("both/and" rather than binary truth) is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of a civilization that "covers its mirrors... and still chooses to look" is a powerful, non-literal resolution to the central inquiry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated "baroque" register that perfectly suits the setting. Interior access is deep, though occasionally mediated by filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") that distance the reader slightly from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("burnished sorrow," "amber honey") with strong rhythm. The score is held back only by the tendency to summarize insights in the penultimate paragraph rather than trusting the dramatized image to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of "visible time" physics with a post-revolutionary archival setting creates a fresh, specific narrative space. The concept of mirrors as temporal conduits/buffers is an ingenious detail that unifies setting and plot.</comment>
