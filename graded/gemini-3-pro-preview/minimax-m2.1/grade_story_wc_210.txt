<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but his emotional arc is static; the "uncomfortable work" is endured without a dramatized moment of hesitation or conflicting impulse in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal line to a valid Decisive Change (restoration of the town), though the cost is largely conceptual (the burden of teaching) rather than a price paid visibly in the beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, with specific details like "amber light" and "paper-lantern cove" anchoring the atmosphere effectively; the environment actively frames the memory work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Escalation is limited; the ritual proceeds linearly without significant external obstacles or an acute "tightening" of options, reading more as a procedural enactment than a conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus magic is coherent and resonant, though the distinction is delivered somewhat didactically ("working memory, not magic") rather than emerging purely through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mythic voice is consistent and controlled, managing the distance well; the tone suits the fable-like quality of the narrative without slipping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by distinct repetition loops ("nothing and everything at once" in paragraphs 5 and 6; "nothing left to wish for" twice in paragraph 2).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of "working memory" contained in porous amber to rebuild a civilization offers a fresh, grounded variation on restoration tropes.</comment>
