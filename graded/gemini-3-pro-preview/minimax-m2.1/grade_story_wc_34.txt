<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies on summarized internal states ("Mira understood the motivation") rather than dramatized conflicting impulses. Mira is competent but static; she faces no difficult micro-choices that test her resolve or force a trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks a decisive turn or obstacle; success feels inevitable. The closure is a "gift" moment (connection achieved) without a legible paid cost or sacrifice to earn the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, blending "crushed cloudberries" and "phosphorescent salts" with the "flower press bolt plate" to ground the liminal setting. The specific props successfully anchor the ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("refused to fade") but not tested against active opposition; the "urgency" is atmospheric rather than causal. No visible price is paid for the success, keeping tension low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but resolved through explicit statement in the final paragraph ("unspoken needs... found their articulation"). This summarizing tendency flattens the emotional resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the fable-like genre, maintaining a distinct "driftingly alert" texture. Occasional phrasing leans precious ("tinkersong wonder") but the perceptual signature remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A distracting repetition artifact ("sequences of light... in sequences") disrupts the flow in the second paragraph. Sentence openings are somewhat repetitive ("Mira had," "Mira worked," "Mira understood"), creating a scaffolded rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of "ghost in code" with analog elements like the "flower press" and "graffiti" creates a fresh, distinct aesthetic. The concept feels imaginative, though the emotional arc is a familiar trope.</comment>
