<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, sharply defined professional, and her cynicism ("simpler and harder than believing") provides a strong filter. However, she lacks on-page internal contradiction or vulnerability; her reaction to the discovery is intellectual and summarized rather than viscerally felt, keeping the emotional stakes distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The transition "Over the following weeks" collapses the rising action and climax into a summary montage, robbing the story of a dramatized discovery scene. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, the structural reliance on time-lapse summary to solve the mystery deflates the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively juxtaposing the "skeletal remains" with the "living canopy" to enforce the central theme. The physical constraints of the dust storms and the radiation mapping on the keeper's skin ground the abstract concepts in concrete reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily intellectual—truth versus myth—and the antagonist is the abstract weight of public opinion. Because the decoding process happens in summary, Mira faces no acute, moment-to-moment pressure or risk of failure on the page, resulting in low immediate stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thesis statements in the final paragraph ("The truth... was simply the stillpoint") to deliver its meaning. This "Thematic Echo" explains the subtext to the reader rather than allowing the imagery of the orchard and diamond to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, intelligent, and consistent, perfectly matching Mira's analytical worldview. The control of psychic distance is strong, though the shift into summary slightly detaches the voice from immediate experience in the second half.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic ("archaeological rhythm," "metastasized"), with high information density. There is a tendency toward abstract telling ("contradiction," "arrogance," "paradox") that occasionally distances the reader from the sensory experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recontextualization of a "cursed diamond" as a data storage device is a fresh, clever sci-fi subversion of a fantasy trope. The synthesis of folklore and radioactive science feels specific and earned, though the execution leans heavily on exposition.</comment>
