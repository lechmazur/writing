<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in specific backstory details (mother, brother), giving weight to her actions. Her competence is high, perhaps reducing the sense of immediate struggle, but her internal state ("exhaustion with fear") adds distinct character texture. The emotional cost is present but feels somewhat familiar/static rather than acutely paid in this specific scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, cohesive procedural arc with excellent orientation throughout. The causality of the magic system (tooth → distortion → release) is established and executed cleanly. The closure is legible—an "Earned Stasis" for Mira and release for the soldier—though the lack of a significant complication makes the progression feel slightly linear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The specific acoustic properties of Echo Gorge are well-integrated into the plot, functioning as a necessary component of the magic rather than just backdrop. Sensory details ("threads of amber light," "splitting into three") are vivid and purposeful. The setting actively constraints and enables the protagonist's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conflict is relatively low-resistance; the soldier arrives ready to confess, and Mira’s first attempt at the ritual succeeds without a need to pivot or escalate tactics. While the emotional stakes are clear, the lack of active opposition or a moment where the outcome is in doubt limits the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of joy coexisting with grief is resonant and consistently developed. However, the narrative tends to articulate the theme explicitly ("healing required joy even, or especially, in parting") rather than allowing it to emerge solely through subtext and action, which softens the impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, maintaining a steady lyrical tone. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Mira saw something she had never seen before") and summarizing emotional states rather than dramatizing them fully in the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("music made of tears," "luminous ache itself"). The reliance on defining emotions through abstract similes rather than concrete imagery sometimes distances the reader. The density of figurative language borders on "purple" in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a "laughing release" for ghosts is a fresh variation on the psychopomp trope. While the execution is somewhat safe and traditional in its structure, the specific combination of elements (crocodile tooth, misaligned harp) adds a distinctive flavor.</comment>
