<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered through the lens of the setting ("vomiting stars," "quiet rebellion"). However, the "rebellion" lacks immediate, on-page cost or risk; the significant physical toll is relegated to backstory, making the victory in the present moment feel slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist successfully bridges the gap to her sister. The narrative arc is linear with minimal obstruction, relying on a scheduled phenomenon (the "hush") rather than a forced choice or causal turn that alters the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is vivid and functionally integrated, with specific sensory rules (moss pulsing, orchids chiming) that constrain the protagonist's actions. The synesthetic environment effectively grounds the ethereal premise and shapes the method of resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear, but the pressure within the scene is low; the protagonist executes a plan without encountering new active resistance or paying a fresh price. The antagonists (scientists) are abstract and absent, leaving the "hush" as a window of opportunity rather than a source of escalating tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of grief and connection is coherent, but the resolution leans into sentimentality ("Mira smiled") and explicit statement ("auroral sorrow") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance is slightly dampened by the "ghost in the machine" trope resolving without ambiguity or cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the ethereal subject matter, effectively conveying the protagonist's perception. However, occasional purple phrasing ("vomiting stars," "liquid light") threatens to distract from the emotional grounding of the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally fluid but marred by lexical repetition ("auric" appears three times in descriptive phrases; "drum/drumming" five times). These artifacts, combined with some adjectival density, reduce the impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" setting offers a fresh, specific sensory experience, but the underlying plot—using tech to connect with a deceased loved one—follows a familiar sentimental trajectory. The lack of risk or subversion in the ending limits the sense of ingenuity.</comment>
