<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific background as an actuary contrasts effectively with her "loosened grip," creating a distinct internal landscape. Motivation is clear and poignant, though the opening transformation ("woke up changed") relies on summary rather than dramatized causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the "windborne solace" confirming her readiness. The structure effectively uses the accumulative weight of the wreckage to earn the internal shift, though the progression feels linear and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "drift-ice marina" is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively mirrors the protagonist's transitional state. Some descriptors ("edge of the world") lean on familiar tropes, but the sensory details of the ice are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily contemplative; while the stakes are life-and-death, the on-page conflict is low-voltage. The resolution arrives through observation (the wind, the ice) rather than a difficult active choice or sharp escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative over-explains its themes ("She understood now that endings were not an arrival but a process") and relies on cliché phrasing ("irony was not lost," "unbreakable spirit") that dilutes the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is generally controlled but marred by usage errors ("an euthanasia") that damage credibility. The reflective distance is consistent but occasionally muffles the raw impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Significant usage and syntax errors undermine the literary polish: "an euthanasia" (phonetic mismatch) and "grown to grips reality" (ungrammatical phrasing). These slips are fatal at a prestigious level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—an actuary volunteering at a disaster site to study the physics of endings before her own euthanasia—is a striking, original synthesis that breathes new life into the terminal diagnosis narrative.</comment>
