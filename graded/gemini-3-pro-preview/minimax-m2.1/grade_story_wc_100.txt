<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Aldric is distinct, but his immediate acceptance of the supernatural ("Aldric understood then") bypasses necessary confusion or struggle, making his competence feel unearned. The "stubbornness" cited in backstory does not manifest as a constraint or tool in the active scene, leaving his internal landscape somewhat static under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary to handle the climax, compressing the central conflict—the healing of the souls—into a montage ("slowly, painstakingly") rather than dramatizing a specific, high-pressure beat. This elides the causal struggle, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and atmospheric ("bookshelves rose like ribs," "swollen and strange"), effectively grounding the surreal shift. Sensory details like the salt smell and the specific quality of light anchor the setting, though the "throne-chair" remains visually vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; Aldric enters the realm, intuits the rules instantly, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost. The stakes are declared (souls needing help) but never tested by a specific obstacle or the possibility of failure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of restoration is coherent but delivered through explicit telling ("felt almost like purpose restored") rather than emerging from subtext. The emotional resolution lands clearly but feels engineered, lacking the resonance that comes from a harder-won victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently weary and measured, fitting the character well. However, occasional phrasing oddities like "bubble-doubled" break immersion, and the narration tends to over-explain the emotional significance of events rather than trusting the action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with a steady rhythm, though it leans on some clichés ("swallowed by the sea") and abstract summaries in the climax. The line-level craft supports the tone but misses opportunities for greater density during the magical operations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of the lighthouse lens and the underwater library creates a fresh, striking central image. While the "undertaker finds purpose" arc is familiar, the surreal execution provides enough ingenuity to distinguish the story from standard genre fare.</comment>
