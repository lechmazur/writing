<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena is a functional protagonist with a clear role, but her shift from technician to "protector" relies on a sudden, summary realization rather than a dramatized pressure-test. The transition feels rushed, and her internal monologue leans heavily on romanticized exposition ("title that sounded romantic") rather than grounded psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative builds a causal chain (device -> heartbeat -> voice) but dissolves into ambiguity at the closure. Elena runs to "find" the message she just heard, but the ending implies she found it "waiting where the girl last stood," blurring whether she found a physical clue, a ghost, or just an echo. The logic of "Come find me" resolving into "they call to be heard" undercuts the urgency of the specific plea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium" and "mercury" glass establish a strong, consistent noir-fantasy atmosphere. However, the spatial geography (observation room vs. atrium vs. outside) becomes murky during the climax, and the description relies partly on adjectival stacking ("impossible lightness") rather than distinct, hard details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The stakes escalate effectively with the heartbeat and the voice, creating a thriller-like urgency ("Come find me"). However, the resolution—a philosophical acceptance that the dead just want to be heard—feels like a de-escalation that evades the concrete demand of the inciting voice, softening the potential tragedy or triumph into a safe thematic summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of grief and listening is coherent, but the story relies on explicit thematic statements ("grief made scientists of us all," "incidental heroism") to deliver its meaning. The resonance is told to the reader in the final paragraph rather than emerging organically from the action of the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the genre, but suffers from over-filtering ("Elena understood," "Elena realized"). The tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("impossible message," "drowning in helplessness") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but marred by significant stock imagery and clichés ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "soft as moth wings," "impossible lightness"). The phrase "reel of hush" reads as an awkward malapropism or forced insertion, breaking the otherwise smooth rhythm of the description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" using retrofitted tech is imaginative and offers a fresh lens on the medium archetype. However, the execution follows a standard pattern of ghostly connection leading to a sentimental realization, lacking a surprising structural or character turn.</comment>
