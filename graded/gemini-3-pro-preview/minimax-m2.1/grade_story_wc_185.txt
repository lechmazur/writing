<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira is defined by competence and physical markers ("ripple-mark skin") rather than internal contradiction or messy humanity. Her motivation is clear, but she faces no distinct character-based choice or trade-off; the narrative relies on her established skills solving a problem linearly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a straight linear path (problem, search, discovery, solution) without a significant complication or on-page cost. While the "bloom of hush" provides a Resonant Reconfiguration, the victory feels virtually frictionless, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "harmonic caves" and "frozen pool" are rendered with high specificity, grounding the abstract concept of sound-based energy beings in tangible geology. The sensory details ("crack patterns," "vibrational currents") effectively constrain the character's method of interaction with the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The pressure is ambient and environmental rather than acute; the energy beings are a constant backdrop but do not actively oppose Mira's specific actions in the scene. The stakes are high (survival), but the on-page escalation is limited to a competence check rather than a forced dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding "quiet in the storm" is coherent and lands with a satisfying, if simple, resonance. The inversion of the echo stone’s purpose—from amplifying sound to creating silence—supports the thematic reconfiguration well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a somber, mythic tone appropriate for the setting. However, it occasionally relies on slightly breathless phrasing ("agony," "soul") that distances the reader slightly from immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense and generally clear, though marred by occasional filter verbs ("understood instinctively," "felt it wash") that dull the immediacy. Some imagery leans on cliché ("frost across a windowpane"), but the technical descriptions of the ice patterns are sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central conceit of "audio-geology"—reading sound stress in ice to find silence—is a genuinely fresh synthesis that elevates the standard post-apocalyptic setup. The "bloom of hush" as a physical null point is a distinct and memorable invention.</comment>
