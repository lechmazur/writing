<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a passive vessel for the plot, characterized chiefly by her job title and a generic "curiosity." She faces no internal contradiction, makes no difficult choices (the investigation is effortless), and pays no emotional or tangible cost for the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies on convenience and summary rather than dramatized causality; Mrs. Okonkwo delivers the backstory immediately upon request, and the climax (the sister's reunion) occurs off-stage in summary. Closure is unearned because no obstacle was overcome to achieve it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The setting is described with competent sensory detail ("worn stone tiles," "fresh scratches"), but remains decorative. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes are purely external to the protagonist, who acts as a bystander to a past tragedy. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the "intrusion" of the delivery truck imposes no actual urgency, and the resolution is achieved without resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraph ("listening was not passive but generative"), converting the story into an essay. This overt moralizing replaces dramatized subtext and resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished, though it leans toward a safe, slightly elevated "workshop" style. Perspective remains firmly with Elena, but the emotional distance keeps the reader observing the feeling rather than experiencing it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("following curiosity like a thread") and slight overwriting ("paradoxical quality," "monument to unfinished conversation"). Sentence structures in the summary sections become repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise of "found letters reuniting estranged sisters" is a familiar sentimental trope executed here without subversion or fresh specificity. The lack of complication or cost yields a predictable, "feel-good" narrative lacking literary edge.</comment>
