<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's interiority is rich and consistent, effectively grounding the narrative in her grief. However, her agency is largely strictly procedural; she performs a task over weeks rather than making difficult, high-stakes choices under pressure in a dramatized scene. The "accident" functions as vague backstory rather than a present pressure cooker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows an Accumulative lens, layering memory and process effectively. While the closure provides a Resonant Reconfiguration of her grief, the central mechanic—mapping dust motes to reconstruct audio—strains causality even for speculative fiction, lacking the "taught" logic required to make the breakthrough feel fully earned rather than magical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral; the attic's skylight and dust motes are not just atmospheric but constitute the toolset for the protagonist's work. The "smell of vanilla and forgetting" is a bit abstract, but the physical constraints of the space shape the method and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story lacks significant escalation or immediate pressure; the stakes are purely internal and processed through summary ("weeks of autumn") rather than a tightening vice of options. The conflict is resolved through steady effort rather than a decisive moment of risk or sacrifice, resulting in a gentle but low-tension arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but delivered through explicit telling rather than subtextual emergence. The final paragraph articulates the moral ("trust is not a single decision but a practice") directly to the reader, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for summarizing the thesis instead of letting the image resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone throughout. It skillfully blends scientific terminology with emotional reflection, though it occasionally slips into overly polished aphorisms that distance the reader from the raw feeling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically sound, but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("specific grief," "perfume... she grew to need") and filter verbs ("Eleanor understood at last"). These artifacts of "telling" reduce the immediacy of the epiphany, keeping the reader observing the emotion rather than experiencing it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central conceit—recovering audio from a meteorite by mapping dust motes—is a highly original and striking synthesis of the prompt elements. While the execution leans heavily on summary, the core imaginative spark distinguishes the piece from standard grief narratives.</comment>
