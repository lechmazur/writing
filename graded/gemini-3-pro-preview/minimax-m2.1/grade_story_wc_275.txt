<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is idealized and static, lacking the "contradictory impulses" or internal friction required for high-band characterization. Her virtue is automatic—she is "senselessly perceptive" and infinitely patient—leaving no room for genuine struggle or a difficult choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary and habitual action ("When the first travelers came") rather than a dramatized scene with specific pressure. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, it restates her established philosophy without a fresh, on-page turning point or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The "glass dome," "desert roses," and "ballast sandbag" provide tangible, textural grounding that elevates the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Conflict is largely retrospective or abstract; the arrival of refugees offers no resistance or threat, making Mira's response automatic. The lack of escalation or a "meaningful tightening" of options leaves the stakes theoretical rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered didactically. The final paragraph functions as a sermon ("Peace was not the absence of fire..."), explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing it to resonate through subtext or image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the contemplative tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("sheathed blade of memory") that creates distance rather than intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally strong and the imagery is dense. The score is held back by the awkward integration of required phrases ("inculcated them with values," "senselessly perceptive") which feel mechanically inserted and disrupt the lyrical flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "pacifist healer in a post-apocalyptic wasteland" is a familiar trope. While the specific imagery (sandbag, roses) adds texture, the narrative arc follows a standard, safe trajectory without a fresh conceptual turn or risk.</comment>
