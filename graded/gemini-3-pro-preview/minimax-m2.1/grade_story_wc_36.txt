<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kira's internal state is detailed, but her evolution relies heavily on introspection rather than pressurized choices. The shift from guilt to acceptance feels like a rationalization ("relics chose their keepers") rather than a transformation earned through active struggle or cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is legible, leading to a clear internal reconfiguration at the junction. However, the narrative is static, relying on a high volume of backstory reflection (Oresta, grandmother) to fill the present frame, which dilutes immediate momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range is a vividly realized setting that integrates well with the theme of listening and continuity. The concept of echoes cascading for minutes provides a strong atmospheric container for the protagonist's silent vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely abstract and retrospective; the pressure is memory-based rather than immediate. The "tightening" is merely spatial (reaching the crossing), and the resolution comes without a forcing mechanism or visible sacrifice in the present moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but the ending relies on a heavy-handed explanation ("knowing that some guardians were meant to act...") rather than trusting the image. This explicitly stated moral flattens the resonance and resolves the ambiguity too neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately contemplative, though it occasionally strains for effect. The meditative tone holds throughout, aligning well with the "canyon hush" atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, though "avalanchingly quiet" is a clashing modifier that draws attention to itself. Some phrasing drifts into abstract telling ("harvest insights from failure") rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The acoustic geography of the setting is a fresh touch, but the "relic keeper contemplating failure" arc follows a standard trajectory. The conclusion—reframing failure as a different kind of duty—is a familiar trope in this genre.</comment>
