<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is idealized, possessing competence without struggle; his blindness functions as a convenient superpower rather than a constraint forcing difficult trade-offs. The narrative lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices with visible cost, resulting in a flat emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The climax is summarized ("A patch here, a careful reconnection there") rather than dramatized, bypassing the pivotal moment of change. Closure is achieved through simple task completion without the required felt or conceptual cost, leaving the ending tidy but weightless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of water refraction provides a vivid, if scientifically soft, grounding for the scene. Atmospheric details of mist and the depot effectively establish a liminal mood, though the setting exerts little pressure on the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the deadline (dawn) creates a clock but generates no genuine obstacles, setbacks, or tactical pivots. The protagonist succeeds effortlessly in a "process procedural" with no escalation of stakes or price paid for success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraphs ("It carried connection," "honest work"), collapsing subtext into didactic statement. Resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "fable" tone, though it occasionally drifts into purple descriptors ("magnetic in the misty silence"). Narrative distance remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically sound but relies on summary for the critical repair action. The prompt phrase "heartfelt artisan" is used as a repetitive label, and the text tells rather than shows the significance of the work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of diagnosing electronics via water refraction patterns is a genuinely fresh, specific image that elevates an otherwise standard "magical repair" vignette. The execution remains safe and trope-heavy.</comment>
