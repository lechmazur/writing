<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mara acts as a competent problem-solver but lacks internal friction, contradiction, or a flaw that complicates her success. Her primary trait, being "functionally creative," is stated as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary to bypass the story's structural climax (the City Council presentation), dissolving tension exactly where it should peak. The leap from discovery to approval ("By noon... That evening... The following week") flattens the causal arc into a list of events without cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory anchoring like the "hollow ribcage" terminal and the smell of "popcorn and sawdust." These details effectively ground the sci-fi archaeology premise in a tangible, decaying reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stakes flatline because there is no active opposition; the mineral deposits are a static obstacle easily overcome by off-screen math. The protagonist faces no trade-offs, risks, or sacrifices, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable and unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("Hope... could not be measured in linear time") rather than dramatized subtext. The final paragraph serves as a moralizing summary that explains the meaning to the reader instead of letting the image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent but maintains an essayistic distance, often summarizing Mara's mental state ("cycling through equations") rather than inhabiting it. The shift into abstract metaphors like "psychological architecture" creates a filter between reader and scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line-level imagery is often evocative ("dark ribbons," "ghost of music"), but the mid-section suffers from heavy telling and time-compression scaffolding. The reliance on abstract phrasing ("heavy with intention") weakens the physical immediacy of the restoration work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise of an ancient spaceport treated as a municipal restoration project is fresh and engaging. However, the execution falls into a "competence porn" safety trap where the solution is linear and risk-free, limiting the narrative's impact.</comment>
