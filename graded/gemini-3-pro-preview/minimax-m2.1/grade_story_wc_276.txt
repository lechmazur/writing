<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Morwen’s established trait of "cool-headedness" anchors the surreal events, making his success with silence earned rather than convenient. The shift from fisher of fish to vessel for a god is a significant internal reconfiguration, grounded well in his patience and tool use. The realization of his purpose feels slightly teleological ("understood finally"), but fits the mythic mode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from mystery to mastery with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The "garden whispered" exposition dump regarding the goddess's death is a minor shortcut that lowers the score slightly by telling rather than dramatizing the discovery. However, the ending lands with clear conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is active and antagonistic, directly constraining the protagonist's choices (forcing silence and zigzag movement) to survive and succeed. The sensory details ("wet paper," "visible vibrations") are vivid and integral to the plot logic. The environment dissolves at the end, emphasizing the permanence of the internal change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal—discipline against chaos—and the pressure scales effectively through the environment's reaction to his stillness. The stakes are heightened by the "others had tried" backstory, though this external opposition is off-page. The resolution feels earned through the specific application of the protagonist's skill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of silence as a force and the "transliteration" of grief into purpose resonates strongly without becoming overly moralistic. The final image of the fisher "fishing for echoes" beautifully recontextualizes the central metaphor. The connection between broken patterns and the goddess's song is thematically cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady distance that suits the fable-like quality. The use of "transliterate" is a required element and handled functionally, though it reads slightly academic for the established POV. The sensory focus remains consistent and grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "constellations... stumbling arcs" and "hollow where fear used to live." Rhythm and syntax support the pacing well, slowing down during the moments of silence. No significant artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "sound wave garden" with a fisher protagonist creates a fresh, memorable conceit. The execution avoids standard fantasy tropes by focusing on a specific, sensory magic system. The risk of abstracting the climax ("voicing silence") pays off with clear imagery.</comment>
