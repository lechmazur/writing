<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined primarily by abstract labels ("thoughtfully spirited," "contemplative") and summary rather than dramatized choice. The "internal glaciers" and emotional stakes are asserted in reflection but not tested by on-page pressure or interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a vignette under an Accumulative lens, but the closure—finishing the vessel—lacks a "decisive change" or legible cost. The scene is linear and coherent, but the stakes remain static throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While atmospheric, the logistics strain credibility; a functioning glass studio (furnace, glory hole) inside an abandoned control room requires more setup to be plausible. The "rusted consoles" add texture but do not constrain the glassblowing process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("capacity for wonder"), facing no resistance or risk of failure in the scene. The "un Freezing" is presented as an inevitable process rather than a struggle won through agency or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit explanation ("A space made solid... a zone of safety") rather than subtext. The constant parallel between the ice outside and the heart inside is heavy-handed and leaves little room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally redundant ("temperamental temperament"). The narrative distance is stable, though it relies heavily on explanatory interiority to convey meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Line-level polish is marred by specific flaws: "temperamental temperament" (redundancy) and "un Freezing" (erratic capitalization). The prose tends toward purple ("icicles weep") and adjective-heavy description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise of an artisan creating a physical metaphor for their internal state is a familiar trope. While the control room setting offers a spark of novelty, the execution relies on standard "thawing heart" clichés.</comment>
