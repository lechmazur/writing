<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara serves as a passive observer rather than an active agent; her "personal loss" is stated as backstory but never generates on-page conflicting impulses or drives a difficult choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece functions as a static vignette rather than a story, lacking the required causal tightening, escalation of options, or decisive change expected for this scope; the closure is reflective rather than reconfigurative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting of the plantation-turned-archive is atmospheric and thematically grounded, with sensory details like "creaking floorboards" effectively supporting the mood, though the "carbon-copy" detail may be anachronistic for 1868 files.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>There is no narrative pressure or risk; the stakes are purely retrospective and thematic, with no moment where the protagonist faces a genuine trade-off or obstacle that tests her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit authorial explanation ("that was precisely why...") rather than emerging organically from action or subtext, resulting in a moralizing lecture that flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The intended lyrical voice is severely undermined by glaring grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("Mara unfurl," "examining unknown the evidence") that disrupt narrative authority and immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Immediate disqualification for professional publication due to basic syntax errors in the opening line ("Mara unfurl") and nonsensical constructions ("examining unknown the evidence") that obscure meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>A standard historical vignette that relies on the sentimental trope of a found object connecting to a lost past, lacking a fresh perspective or narrative subversion to elevate the premise.</comment>
