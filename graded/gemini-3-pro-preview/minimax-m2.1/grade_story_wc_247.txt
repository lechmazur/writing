<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s internal landscape of grief is rendered with sensitivity, and her motivation to bridge the silence is clear. However, the "whispering advisor" functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized character, and his sudden disappearance feels like a convenient device rather than an earned character exit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, building atmosphere toward the encounter with Elena. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanics—Elena arriving in a rowboat at night just as Marina practices—rely heavily on dream logic/coincidence rather than strict causality, softening the earned nature of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor" is established with vivid, sensory details ("shattered silver," "waves against wooden docks") that ground the ethereal tone. The setting actively supports the climax, providing the necessary isolation and atmosphere for the silent exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly defined as emotional and relational, but the pressure remains relatively low; the connection with Elena feels inevitable rather than fought for. The narrative lacks a moment of acute doubt or a "tightening" where Marina risks failure, making the emotional release feel slightly predetermined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "unrecorded memory" is poignant, and the vintage camera serves as an excellent objective correlative. However, the score is capped because the theme is explicitly articulated by the advisor ("You translate silence into music"), turning subtext into text and reducing the reader's role in decoding the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. The shift from internal reflection to the shared moment is handled smoothly, though the narration occasionally filters experience through heavy simile rather than direct sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong but stumbles into repetitive phrasing at the climax ("particular rhythm of loss... particular joy" in the same paragraph). Some descriptions border on purple ("unreasonable beauty"), which slightly dulls the emotional impact of the otherwise sharp imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, the camera metaphor, and the harbor setting creates a distinct and memorable aesthetic. While the "magical mentor" trope is familiar, the specific application of "mapping silence" to grief offers a fresh angle on the genre.</comment>
