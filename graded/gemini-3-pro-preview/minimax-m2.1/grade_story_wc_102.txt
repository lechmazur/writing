<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mei functions as a capable vessel for the concept rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or genuine obstacle. Her success is immediate and inevitable, lacking the difficult micro-choices or visible personal cost required to drive a compelling narrative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The plot is a linear procedural (arrive, detect, heal) that lacks a decisive turning point or causal complication. The resolution acts as a "soft reset" where the problem dissolves through competence alone, failing to generate the tension or structural consequence needed for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospherically vivid ("twilight settled like a held breath") but leans heavily on static "postcard" description. While the viaduct and wisteria provide a backdrop, they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert active pressure on the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tension is virtually absent, as there is no antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure to test the protagonist's goal. The narrative progresses smoothly from identification to resolution without any meaningful escalation or threat to the status quo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit lecture ("Unused love, she understood then, was not stored in any heaven") rather than subtext, triggering the "Thematic Echo" penalty. This didactic approach explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered through high-register abstraction and explanatory interiority ("she understood now what she had to do"). While the "foggy lucidity" tone is maintained, the voice lacks the distinct, grounded perceptual texture of a specific individual in crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose relies on "purple" metaphors ("signature of salt," "liquid pearl") and abstract similes ("like the thoughts of earth itself") that prioritize poetic sound over precision. This density of ornamental artifacts creates a scaffold that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the "spiritual camera obscura" concept is inventive, the execution follows a standard "magical healer" template without subversion or risk. The lack of narrative resistance or a fresh structural angle results in a predictable, albeit polished, vignette.</comment>
