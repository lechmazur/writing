<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly embodied ("pulse of a dying seedling"), but the reliance on diagnostic language ("nervous system doing what it needed to do") creates a clinical distance that undercuts the raw grief. The character's agency is largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene, though the internal struggle is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for the subject matter, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the reliance on summary for the first 80% leaves the final scene feeling slightly rushed, and the "winter morning" vignette carries a heavy burden to resolve three years of exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the "salt-crusted" greenhouse and "wind-scoured promontory" actively constraining and mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The physical environment acts as a crucible for the healing process, charging the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The internal conflict is coherent and stakes are high (sanity/survival). The pressure of the "weather" of grief is well-rendered, though the lack of immediate, on-page external opposition limits the dramatic tension to the internal sphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core theme of realistic endurance is poignant, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("optimism could grow not from denial but..."). This thematic echo explains the subtext rather than trusting the night-blooming cereus image to carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, suiting the "quiet" nature of the protagonist. The shift into therapy-speak ("somatic markers") creates a slight register clash, momentarily breaking the immersive, poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("faces melted into abstraction"). However, the inclusion of clinical terminology ("somatic," "nervous system") in otherwise sensory passages creates a jarring artifact that feels like an authorial intrusion rather than character perception.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of gardening as trauma recovery is familiar, but the specific, darker context of the "wedding that wasn't" (implied drone strike) adds a fresh, sharp edge. The execution elevates a standard trope through sensory specificity.</comment>
