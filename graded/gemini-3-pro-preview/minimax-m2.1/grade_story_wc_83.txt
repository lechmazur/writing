<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct, blending scientific detachment with raw trauma, though the motivation ("hunting unused potential") feels abstract and slightly performative. While the internal state is vivid, the characterization occasionally drifts into diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied reaction to the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a static vignette driven by reflection, which fits the meditative scope but limits causal propulsion and active pressure. Closure lands as a valid "Earned Stasis"—a reaffirmation of the hunt—but the reliance on heavy backstory (the wedding) outweighs present-moment action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is a striking, specific environment ("electromagnetic cables," "red LED status lights"), effectively grounding the abstract math in physical space. However, orientation is slightly delayed, establishing the immediate physical setting fully only after the wedding reminiscence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is almost entirely internal and retrospective; the cooling circuit breakers provide a clock but do not force a tactical decision or escalation. The stakes are philosophical, lacking a concrete on-page test or trade-off beyond the protagonist's existing emotional burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("I call it the only way forward," "This is bleak exhilaration") rather than subtext. The story lectures the reader on its meaning, reducing the "unfiltered awakening" to a stated label rather than a felt experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and poetic, maintaining a consistent "traumatized intellectual" register that fits the setting. The shift between the mundane (urination) and the cosmic is effective, though the voice occasionally lapses into overwrought phrasing ("the sky learned our names").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm, though marred by "telling" artifacts ("intangibly tangible," "perturbation theory applied to...") that flatten the imagery. The line-level density is good, but the reliance on definition-sentences to explain the character's state reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone-strike survivor narrative with a sci-fi/mystical "floating observatory" hunting for mathematical ghosts is genuinely fresh and inventive. The conceptual risk is high and memorable, even if the execution leans too heavily on exposition.</comment>
