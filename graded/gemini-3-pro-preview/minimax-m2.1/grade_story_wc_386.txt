<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a static archetype with no active agency or internal contradiction on the page; she observes and reflects but makes no difficult choices. Her motivation is delivered via abstract summary ("sought to salvage") rather than dramatized through struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies entirely on retrospective summary and exposition, lacking a dramatized scene with present-moment causality. The ending is a statement of future intent ("She would find") rather than an on-page closure event or paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric description is vivid but operates as a static backdrop; the setting does not constrain action or force tactical shifts. The physical logic of a melting snow globe in a freezing glacier is poetic but decorative, lacking causal weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract and retrospective; the mystery is presented as already solved via summary, removing tension. There is no active resistance or antagonist to force meaningful escalation, rendering the "investigation" a fait accompli.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Themes are delivered through explicit authorial assertion ("understood its preservation as a form of stubborn testimony") rather than emergent subtext. The emotional resonance is told to the reader rather than earned through specific, grounded experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent in its reverent tone but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the character's insights. The psychic distance is too remote to allow for visceral engagement with the grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from extreme simile density ("like delicate flames," "like cathedral ribs," "like fallings of gentle snow," "like a message"), creating a predictable, decorative cadence. This overwriting prioritizes ornament over clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the glacier-shrine setup has potential, the execution relies on familiar "sad ghost child" tropes and passive reflection. The story lacks a specific, transformative turn that would elevate the concept beyond a static tableau.</comment>
