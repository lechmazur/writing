<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is a highly competent protagonist who faces the external problem with efficiency, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful flaws. Her journey is a procedural success rather than a character test; she ends the story in the same emotional state she began, having paid no personal price for her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal lens (problem identified, solution calculated, solution enacted), but the resolution comes too easily. The "cosmic tricksters" are defeated by a single night of work without a "felt cost" or sacrifice from the protagonist, making the closure feel tidy but weightless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting of the university radio station is grounded with specific details like the "dusty holder" and "ancient equipment," which effectively contrast with the cosmic stakes. The atmosphere supports the plot well, though the transition from mundane to magical is somewhat expository.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the stakes (campus unity) are high, the antagonism is passive; the "tricksters" never actively counter-move or threaten Maya directly. The conflict is resolved through calculation rather than a high-stakes trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low tension despite the "warring factions" backdrop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of engineered division versus organic discourse is coherent and legible. However, the connection between "subsonic waves" and political polarization feels slightly didactic, and the resolution (people suddenly listening to each other) leans toward a simplified moral victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and professional, maintaining a steady distance. The voice slips into exposition when explaining the nature of the tricksters ("operated for eons," "feeding on conflict"), which creates a slight distance from the immediate scene pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with generally high clarity. A few moments strain for effect (e.g., "ethereal grit... like a second skeleton" is a confusing mixed metaphor), but the technical descriptions of the audio-magic interface are handled well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of a radio DJ battling cosmic horror with frequencies is an engaging, if established, trope (reminiscent of *Welcome to Night Vale*). The execution is competent but plays it safe, lacking a surprising twist or a distinctively fresh subversion of the genre.</comment>
