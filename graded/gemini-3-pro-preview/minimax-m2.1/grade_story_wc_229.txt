<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine flaws; her mastery of the "nearly impossible" technique is instantaneous, aided by the jasmine which bypasses any struggle or cost. Mira functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a character making difficult choices with visible consequences. The narrative tells us she purifies her intentions but dramatizes only the immediate success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure with legible closure, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical tool that works on the first attempt without complication. The causality is functional but lacks tension, as the "thermal currents" affecting the light are resolved by a pseudo-magical fix that faces no resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "cobalt lighthouse" and "salt-worn granite" are vivid and ground the scene well. However, the premise of heat creating thermal currents that block a lighthouse beam strains suspension of disbelief without a firmer grounding in the story's internal logic or magic system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Escalation is minimal; the protagonist identifies the problem and immediately applies the winning solution without facing new obstacles or paying a price. The antagonism—weather and panic—crumbles instantly before the jasmine essence, robbing the climax of pressure or earned triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through the logbook entry ("The whispers were right"), reducing subtext to a moral statement. While the concept of empathy as a beacon is coherent, the execution is heavy-handed, relying on assertions of "screaming tenderness" rather than earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose ("bruised clouds," "wounded stars") that distances the reader. The tone is earnest but lacks the rhythmic variance needed to build genuine tension during the crisis moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A severe text artifact ("essence,珍贵 as gold") disrupts the reading experience, signaling a lack of basic proofing. Additionally, phrased like "verbal equivalent of grasping hands" feel clunky, and the prose frequently overwrites imagery where concision would serve the tension better.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on familiar tropes of magical realism—the empathetic lighthouse keeper and the magic flower—without adding a fresh twist or specific emotional complexity. The synthesis feels generic, offering a safe, predictable path rather than a novel exploration of the premise.</comment>
