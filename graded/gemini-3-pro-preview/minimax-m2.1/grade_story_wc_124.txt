<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is somewhat passive, serving largely as a vessel for the theme; the central realization is delivered via internal summary rather than earned through high-stakes choices or active struggle against the grief. The specific "broker" occupation provides flavor but does not significantly shape her on-page tactics or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path with low complication, relying on an "explain-everything" climax where the brother's research intentions are summarized rather than dramatized. The closure lands on a realization that feels intellectually delivered rather than emotionally earned through action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong, atmospheric setting with vivid specific details like the UV fluorescence and moss-dampened sound. The "Conservatory of Lost Blooms" effectively grounds the fantastical elements, though the anthropomorphic plants ("leaning with recognition") lean slightly into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tension is low; the conflict is entirely internal and resolves smoothly without a moment of doubt or risk of failure. The obstacle—fear of the scent—is overcome easily, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Subtext is flattened by explicit moralizing in the final section, where the story defines its theme directly ("grief is just the shape of caring..."). This "Thematic Echo" violates the "show, don't tell" principle and reduces the ending's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and melancholic, fitting the mood, but occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("aromatically cautious attention"). The narrative distance remains stable, though it filters the experience heavily through explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Functional and readable, but marred by awkward modifier stacks ("aromatically cautious attention") and frequent filter verbs ("Mirabel saw," "Mirabel understood") that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "lantern broker" concept and UV memory-revealing mechanism are imaginative and fresh. However, the synthesis relies on a standard "grief is love" trope that lacks a unique, non-obvious twist in its emotional execution.</comment>
