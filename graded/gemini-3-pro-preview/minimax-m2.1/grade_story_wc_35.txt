<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear motivation (seeking silence) that evolves into a purpose (endurance). The "sandpaper" metaphor effectively internalizes her role, and the final state of being "sturdy brittle" earns the character arc. However, the shift from reclusive exhaustion to the active labor of the cure feels slightly frictionless; the emotional cost of the "three days" is summarized rather than dramatized in a moment of doubt or near-failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to diagnosis to resolution with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The primary weakness is the reliance on a montage ("The work took three days") for the central conflict, which flattens the rising action into a procedural summary. The causality is functional—she analyzes, cooks, and heals—but lacks a decisive "pinch" point where the outcome is genuinely in question on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and imaginative, with the "ice formed coral branches" and "liquid moonlight" creating a strong surreal atmosphere that grounds the magic system. The juxtaposition of the desert heat and the frozen interior is effective. While the logistics of cooking (fire, ingredients) in this frozen abstraction are elided, the sensory details of the pavilion itself successfully carry the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes (being overwhelmed by remorse) are established early, but the conflict plays out as "Man vs. Nature" where the protagonist prevails through steady competence without significant opposition. The resolution feels inevitable once the cooking begins; the story would benefit from a moment where the "accumulated weight" actively resists her efforts or forces a harder trade-off than mere time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The thematic conclusion—that healing is not the removal of pain but the endurance of it—is resonant and well-earned by the final image. The correspondence between specific dishes and emotions (lamb = reconciliation, honey = forgiveness) borders on allegorical simplicity, but the broader concept of "smoothing rough edges" rather than erasing them elevates the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suited to the fable-like quality of the story. However, there is a tendency to explain rather than show, using filter verbs ("she could taste," "she felt") and abstract summaries ("joy or sorrow," "unspoken regret") that distance the reader from the immediate visceral experience of the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose has a pleasing rhythm and contains strong imagery ("seeping into every molecule like salt into sea-weathered wood"). However, there are scaffold artifacts like "not metaphorically, but literally" and the tautological "emotions were emotionally contagious" that clutter the line-level craft. Abstract nouns (grief, trauma, remorse) occasionally crowd out more specific sensory descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic cooking magic with a surreal desert-ocean setting is fresh and memorable. While the trope of the "healer absorbing pain" is familiar, the specific mechanism—cooking counter-flavors to smooth the jagged architecture of memory—offers a unique and creative twist on the concept.</comment>
