<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren creates a distinct focal point, but the secondary characters yield too easily to her monologue; Sera’s shift from vengeance to "softening" feels narrated rather than earned by pressure in the moment. The emotional turn relies on shared backstory (the list of names) rather than an active, conflicting choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scene has a clear arc and legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the causal mechanism—a speech and a list—resolves the tension with minimal friction. The handshake feels like a "soft" resolution given the established weight of "forever war," lacking a moment where the deal nearly breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is anchored effectively with sensory details ("grinding against stone," "amber light," "ebony clipboard") that ground the abstract political stakes. The "terrace" functions well as a stage for the interaction, though the celestial bodies border on ornamental framing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high (war/peace), but the on-page conflict lacks escalation; the antagonists arrive ready to listen and crumble immediately upon hearing Maren’s speech. There is no active counter-move from the warlords that forces Maren to improvise or pay a higher price than she planned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Peace does not honor the dead. It saves the living") and narration ("found her own redemption"), leaving little room for subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what the events mean rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and dignified, fitting the high-stakes diplomacy, though it occasionally slips into abstraction ("particular geometry of a loss"). The narrative distance is stable, keeping the focus tightly on Maren’s internal and external experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from abstract phrasing ("particular weight," "particular geometry") and the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("operatively gentle") as labels. The rhythm is smooth, but the reliance on explaining emotions reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "negotiation on neutral ground" and "reading the names of the dead" are familiar tropes in fantasy/diplomacy fiction. While executed competently, the story follows a standard template without subverting the expected beats or offering a fresh conceptual angle.</comment>
