<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on exposition and retrospective summary rather than present-tense action. Mira lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses; her "thistled calm" renders her static, and she faces no difficult micro-choices that would reveal depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a vignette rather than a story, lacking a causal chain or meaningful escalation. The ending—a validation of the premise that dust remembers—fails to provide a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the protagonist ends exactly where she began.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but generic to the genre, leaning on standard tropes like "ruined city" and "cracked windows" without specific constraint on the action. The "dust" is the most distinct element, but the environment does not force tactical trade-offs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the patrols are a hypothetical background threat rather than an immediate pressure. There is no tightening of stakes, no meaningful reversal, and no cost paid by the protagonist to execute her will.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary ("music itself had become a form of resistance") rather than subtext. The story asserts its meaning directly to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently summarizing Mira's history and methods instead of immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience. The tone creates a buffer that reduces urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose is competent but overly adjectival and relies on "telling" emotions ("thistled calm," "peaceful resolve"). Rhythm is largely static, and the text lacks the sentence-level propulsion needed for a high-stakes broadcast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "story famine" premise is a familiar trope that is not transformed here by specific, lived detail. While the concept of "teaching dust" offers a spark of ingenuity, it operates via unexplained quasi-magic rather than grounded logic.</comment>
