<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("built walls," "tender into the terrible") rather than dramatized behavior to establish internal conflict. While the motivation is stated, Maren's transformation feels more like a reaction to the magical whale than a struggle with her own specific history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a legible Decisive Change with the abandonment of the scrimshaw, satisfying the causal lens. However, the inciting incident (the whale arriving right "tonight") feels convenient, and the "violence impossible" constraint functions only as backstory rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details regarding the scrimshaw ("warmed by her skin") and the dock are tactile and grounding. However, phrasing like "violet hour" borders on cliché, and the "re-education ships" remain a vague backdrop that doesn't fully inhabit the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stakes of emotional imprisonment vs. freedom are clear, and the cost (leaving the heirloom/safety) is paid on the page. The escalation, however, is largely internal monologue prompted by the whale, lacking a sharpening of external obstacles before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph which reduces the narrative to a maxim ("some locks only open..."). The text also over-explains its own symbols ("This was the talisman's true purpose"), leaving little room for subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but tends toward an intrusive, explanatory mode that interprets Maren's feelings for the reader. The narrative distance collapses into abstraction ("world's certainties blurred") rather than staying close to Maren's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is fluid but marred by oxymoron stacking ("combative tenderness," "fierce gentleness") and abstract descriptions ("more elegy than silhouette"). These artifacts reduce precision and drift into purple prose during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the "violence impossible" concept offers a unique sci-fi hook, it is relegated to backstory in favor of a fairly standard "call of the wild/ocean" trope. The resolution feels safe and familiar rather than ingeniously specific to the established constraints.</comment>
