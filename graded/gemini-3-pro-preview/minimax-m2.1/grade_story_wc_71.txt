<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira is introspective and consistent, though the "creeping normality" label feels slightly external to the established voice. The lack of interpersonal or internal friction limits depth; she observes rather than struggles, resulting in a character who processes the world without risking much within it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A coherent accumulative design where sensory details build effectively to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is solid, and the pacing fits the contemplative mode, though the ending feels slightly inevitable rather than earned through a sharp narrative turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's strongest asset; specific details like the "orris root" and "violet hour" create a tactile, immersive atmosphere. The house functions effectively as a sensory archive that actively constraints and guides the protagonist's attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are purely conceptual, lacking active resistance or a concrete risk of failure. The escalation is linear—light fading, awareness deepening—rather than pressured, resulting in a contemplative arc that feels low-tension despite the atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory as physical residue is well-developed through the orris root motif and object displacement. However, the final paragraph leans into expository summary ("Houses feel alive because...") rather than trusting the accumulated imagery to carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is generally controlled and effective, though prompt-inserted phrases like "creeping normality noticer" disrupt the rhythm. The narration maintains a consistent psychic distance, filtering the world clearly through Mira's hyper-attentive bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by a significant usage error where the verb "sanctify" is used as a noun ("through the sanctify of"). Occasional overwriting ("streetlights daydream") slightly clutters the otherwise clean sensory descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A capable, atmospheric iteration of the "sensory ghost" trope. The "creeping normality" angle offers a fresh theoretical frame for a haunting story, though the execution relies largely on familiar beats of quiet observation and realized presence.</comment>
