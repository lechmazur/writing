<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a character under pressure; she accepts the task and executes it without internal conflict, difficult choices, or emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The structure is solid and the closure valid, but the midpoint obstacle (the safe) yields too easily to "careful manipulation," missing a chance for causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "dry knowledge" and "rings of growth" create a distinct, textured atmosphere that effectively grounds the fantastical library in a physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the ticking clock provides a frame, the narrative lacks genuine escalation; Mira faces no setbacks, and the "cost" of the library's destruction is accepted rather than fought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The thematic resonance is undercut by the final paragraph, which resorts to explicit moralizing ("discoveries were about limits") instead of letting the imagery speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and tonally appropriate but maintains a safe, essayistic distance that tells us what Mira understands rather than showing her process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from abstraction ("unified wisdom," "fractally precise architecture") and poetic cliché ("heightened stillness") that blunts the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, an arboreal library, and stellar mapping offers a genuinely fresh and imaginative premise.</comment>
