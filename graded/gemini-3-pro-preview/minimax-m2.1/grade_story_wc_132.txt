<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera’s resistance is organically rooted in her profession, and the medical diagnosis provides tangible pressure for the internal conflict. The shift from detachment to vulnerability is earned, though the final epiphany relies on somewhat abstract "label-speak" ("transformation required appetite") rather than purely embodied action, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving clearly from the inciting letter to the resonant reconfiguration at the trellis. The closure is effective and legible, with the phone call serving as a decisive action that cements the internal shift. The pacing allows the accumulative weight of the leaf and the diagnosis to land effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nursery is not just a backdrop but an active participant; the mossy trellis and the linden leaf physically constrain the protagonist’s epiphany. Sensory details like the "bruises" of the clouds and the "wet earth" effectively mirror the internal physiological and emotional state, satisfying the high-band criteria for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established and escalated by the irony of the grant arriving alongside the medical decline. The conflict between professional mastery and personal loss creates coherent pressure. The resolution forces a trade-off—surrendering control to gain connection—that carries a felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of metamorphosis is coherent and well-integrated into the plant imagery throughout. However, the ending explicitly articulates the thesis in the dialogue summary ("admitted... that transformation required appetite"), which functions as a "Thematic Echo" and reduces the implicit power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, meditative, and appropriately detached, fitting the protagonist's scientific worldview. The modulation of psychic distance—from the clinical observation of the leaf to the intimate admission of fear—is handled with assurance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with imagery. While generally strong, occasional phrases like "particular perfume of transformation" veer slightly into abstraction. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops, and the sentence-level propulsion supports the story’s introspective pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of an expert finding personal wisdom through their trade is a familiar literary trope, but the specific irony of the grant and the physical detail of the shaking hands add freshness. The execution is high-quality, though the core metaphor feels slightly safe and traditional.</comment>
