<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's mercury-glass physiology is distinct and visually integrated ("casting no shadow"), anchoring the character. However, the internal pivot from fear to acceptance is summarized ("On the eighth night, she finally understood") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear with a legible closure (leaving the mountain). The reliance on a summary time-jump ("seven nights") to resolve the central obstacle weakens the causal density of the middle beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric imagery ("mountain's throat," "digestive tract") effectively grounds the fantastical setting. The environment feels distinct, though the "infinite library" concept is a familiar genre standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are established (sanctuary vs. memory), but the escalation is intellectualized. The struggle occurs in a summary block rather than an on-page confrontation of values, reducing the felt pressure of the choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Shape of home... is a language") and explanatory narration ("vocabulary of healing"). The resonance is stated rather than emerging from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality suitable for the content. Narrative distance is somewhat high, often labeling emotions ("gratitude," "grief") rather than embodying them in immediate sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose flows smoothly but leans toward abstract metaphors ("architecture of grief," "thunder of impending change") that border on purple. The density of figurative language occasionally stifles immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer is an inventive and striking visual concept. However, the surrounding framework—a wise keeper in a magical library dispensing life lessons—is a well-worn genre trope.</comment>
