<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is a passive observer whose primary action is to follow instructions (digging where pointed). While her internal state is described, she lacks contradictory impulses or active agency under pressure; her "astonished" nature is told via label rather than dramatized through reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear vignette that moves smoothly from setup to resolution, but it lacks causal density or significant turns. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting the burden), but the lack of obstacles makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atmospheric details are the story's strength, with vivid imagery like "skeletons of beekeeping equipment" and "pools of amber." The setting establishes a strong mood, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the environment is harsh but static, and the ghost is helpful rather than oppositional. There is no meaningful tightening of options or stakes; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, resulting in a low-tension experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit summary ("someone must remember," "weight of unspoken words") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on telling the reader what the story means flattens the potential for subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from a heavy reliance on abstract nouns and filter verbs ("understood," "felt rather than heard"). The narrative distance remains somewhat remote, prioritizing poetic description over immediate character experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies heavily on literary clichés and stock phrases ("impossible lightness," "eloquence of silence," "ribs of... creature"). The use of "contextual clues" as a direct phrase disrupts the register, reading as an academic intrusion in a lyrical passage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of a post-apocalyptic survivor communing with a ghost to preserve memory is a familiar trope. While competent, the execution follows a safe, standard path without subverting expectations or offering a fresh specific insight.</comment>
