<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is distinct and deeply felt; Eleanor’s internal conflict between her habit of metaphorical distance and the need for a raw apology drives the scene effectively. The relationship history is efficiently packed into the interaction, and Margot’s pushback (“You always spoke in riddles”) forces a genuine character turn. The "exorcist" role adds unique flavor, though it functions primarily as backstory rather than active mechanics in this specific beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves excellent closure via Resonant Reconfiguration; the apology is delivered "too late to matter" but recontextualizes the grief as a "clean break." The pacing is tight, utilizing the "induced currents" and the waking orchard as a precise clock that pressures the protagonist’s choice. The causality is clean, with the protagonist’s agency driving the emotional climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting details—the waking chainsaws, the violet glass, and the archive of unfinished music—are masterfully integrated to charge the final image. The orchard’s destruction parallels the necessary "pruning" of the relationship, allowing the environment to function as a thematic amplifier rather than just a backdrop. Specific sensory anchors like the "first chainsaw cough" effectively ground the ethereal elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalate coherently as the "currents" thin and the orchard crews arrive. Eleanor’s decision to abandon her safety mechanism (metaphors) for a direct apology represents a meaningful tightening of conflict and a significant micro-choice. The cost is legible and felt: the apology cannot fix the past, only alter Eleanor's internal stance toward the loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "pruning" to allow new growth is woven seamlessly through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image that reframes the tragedy. The story avoids simple sentimentality by acknowledging the "imperfect" nature of the miracle. The connection between the unfinished symphony and the sisters' relationship adds rich, non-discursive subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, the reliance on simile constructions ("like a held breath," "like a bill," "like stones") creates a repetitive rhythmic cadence that occasionally distracts. Despite this, the POV remains tightly controlled and the sisters' dialogue voices are distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, it suffers from a high density of "like a [noun]" simile structures (e.g., "like a candle," "like loosened strings," "like stones"), some of which lean toward cliché. This "template cadence" in figurative language dampens the otherwise strong imagery. The sentence-level propulsion is good, but the repetitive syntax limits the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a "gossip-column exorcist" is fresh and engaging, even if served here mostly by the specific "currents" mechanic. The juxtaposition of the mechanical (chainsaws) with the mystical (séance) creates a unique texture that feels distinct from standard ghost stories. The ending elevates the premise beyond a simple goodbye.</comment>
