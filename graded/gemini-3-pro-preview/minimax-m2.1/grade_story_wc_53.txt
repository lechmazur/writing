<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct and drives the accumulation of evidence; the internal conflict with the "ghost" effectively externalizes the struggle. The protagonist's resignation at the end feels earned by the prior physical accumulation of the camera's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens works well, with the camera's increasing weight creating a clear physical escalation that leads to the ghost's appearance. The closure (Earned Stasis) lands with a legible conceptual cost—accepting exhaustion over resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is a vivid, specific environment that actively constrains movement (boots finding solid ground on water). The atmosphere supports the surreal logic without breaking consistency or obscuring the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (internal peace), and the pressure escalates through the physical manifestation of the collected stories. The conflict remains somewhat static until the final confrontation, but the cost of the final resignation is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central theme is compelling, but the protagonist explicitly articulates the thesis ("failure is ordinary") in dialogue. This diagnostic label-speak reduces subtextual resonance in the climax, trading implication for declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the surreal mode perfectly. Narrative distance is controlled, maintaining close focus on Mira's internal landscape without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, though the density of similes ("like smoke," "like a garment," "like sediment") occasionally slows momentum. The final image of the plastic teeth catching sunless light is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of excavating a ghost via a camera that captures the weight of stories is highly original. The synthesis of the surreal setting with the specific theme of eroded ambition feels fresh and distinct.</comment>
