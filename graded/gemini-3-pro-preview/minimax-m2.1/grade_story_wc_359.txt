<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Yara serves as a functional vehicle for the ritual rather than an agent with internal conflict. She faces no difficult choices or trade-offs; her success is pre-ordained by the "whispered coordinates" and lack of opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear ritual enactment with no obstacles or logical friction. The closure is "Symmetric Satisfaction," resolving the global stake perfectly without any legible cost or sacrifice on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synesthetic descriptions create a vivid, distinct atmosphere that fits the mythic tone. However, the setting functions as a cooperative backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the environment welcomes the protagonist and the task faces no resistance. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("world's slow cooling") that are never tested by concrete on-page threats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit sermonizing in the final paragraphs ("Wonder was not luxury...") rather than dramatized subtext. This didactic approach flattens the thematic resonance into a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("chromatic truth," "impossible spectra"). The mid-scene POV shift to the distant sculptor disrupts the focalization without earning the omniscience through prior pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prompt word "certify" clashes awkwardly with the high-fantasy register, creating bureaucratic dissonance. Repetitive phrasing ("sculpted hush," "unfettered") feels like keyword stuffing rather than intentional motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise relies on familiar tropes of a chosen one performing a magical fix for the world. The specific combination of elements feels like a checklist response rather than a fresh, organic synthesis.</comment>
