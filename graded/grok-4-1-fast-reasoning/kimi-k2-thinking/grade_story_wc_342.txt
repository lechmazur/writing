<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodiment of face-blind trait via coin's tactile geometry, revealed in painting micro-choices; interiority concrete in trembling hands and heart-drum under demo pressure. Weakness: epiphanic realization ("some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them") feels slightly unearned without prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of loss coheres with traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via fractal layering; single continuous scene oriented by ~50 words (Kael in oak library pre-demo). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final image of fractal dust/sky escape, with felt cost of erasure ("relic of a world about to be erased"). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree-trunk setting (bark cracks, spiraling shelves) constrains choices via cracking plaster/transfer and charges final image (walls shimmer as trunk shudders). Sensory hierarchy (scent of paper/paint, siren's wail) filters through artist's priorities; evolves causally to dust. Micro-object (coin) as setting anchors tactile infinity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirror sky pre-demo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via density of fractal branching and time-cadence (morning glow → siren). Agency in coin-press forecloses failure path with visible cost (walls flicker uncertainly). One decisive tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of limits/infinite emerges organically from coin's geometry to sky-mirror failure/success; final image ("sky, now free, expanded beyond any wall") reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (fractal contours, sky hues in skin); rhythmic modulation accelerates to siren ("heart a drum against the silence"). Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing hush/build-shudder; no head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("hush" x3-4, "fractally precise" echoes without variation) dull ~10% mid-beats; metaphors coherent (lightning in stillness). Rhythm varies read-aloud, no template cadence at closure; minor synonym churn for "sky/shimmer" in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Core premise (face-blind fractal via coin for sky-mural in dying tree) synthesizes fresh angle on infinity/limits; risk of poetic compression pays off in charged poise. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable tactile geometry heightens stakes.</comment>
