<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's gossip-column past drives conflicted motivation, embodied in hesitant metaphors and micro-choice to use perfume; Linden's skepticism yields earned softening without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through scent density to Charged Poise closure: hand-take amid falling tree reconfigures regret with orchard-loss cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's musty sheets and piano constrain intimate reconnection; recurring mist and cut-wood scent charge closure image, filtering through Mira's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Apology stake signaled early, textural escalation via mist-release deepens relational pressure; Linden's nod forecloses rejection, with imperfect heal cost felt on exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge from particulars like mist-bridge and axe-song metaphor, reweighting rumor-to-truth without statement; final resonance lingers in flawed harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward spectral metaphors; sparse dialogue carries subtext in Linden's "mirror" line, distinct from Mira's poetic indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with mist-curl propulsion; minor metaphorical density in peak scent-beat slightly blurs but supports accumulative texture without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exorcist-perfume currents synthesize fresh angle on regret, transforming tropes via specific orchard-hush grit; risk in metaphor-dialogue heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
