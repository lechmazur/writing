<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in talisman and practice compels adaptive choices like tuning to breathing; embodied interiority peaks in forehead-near-touch during link. Minor reflective summaries slightly dilute contradictory impulses under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to eclipse totality; closure as Charged Poise in Eleanor's whisper and Mira's resurfaced sensations, with legible cost in unprovable resonance "in her bones." Single scene oriented immediately; no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eclipse shadow darkening room to "amber twilight" constrains timing and charges climax; cedar scent and lavender quilt filter through Mira's perceptual bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Recurring "dreaming roots" evolves to frame closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging memory bridge tightens via flutter-lips-link-whisper progression under Accumulative lens; agency in leaning forward forecloses isolation with felt cost of ninety-second suspension ending in peaceful sleep.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's transformation emerges via lullaby-eclipse synthesis; final image of rearranged heart and bell offers non-literal reconfiguration of premise without moralizing, reweighting "hush of dreaming roots."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with musical perceptual signature (notes "worn smooth," chord pitch-match); rhythmic prose modulates from unhurried to suspended intensity, eliding overt exposition for lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "moon-shadow darkened the sun, turning the room into a chamber of amber twilight"; varied syntax propels to closure without loops, artifacts, or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solar eclipse as music therapy catalyst transforms dementia trope via generational lullaby and hair-curl pulse; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in "veil... thin enough to touch," with risk-taking in quiet resonance payoff.</comment>
