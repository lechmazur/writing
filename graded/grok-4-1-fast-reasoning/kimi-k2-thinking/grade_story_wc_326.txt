<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via heartbeat-counting habit and fear of heart forgetting, embodied in private metronome; mirrors ghost effectively for earned realization. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. seeking wisdom) act in ink-tracing and shard-pressing. Minor epiphanic abstraction in "failure could be a teacher" edges from peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink density, pattern shifts, shard merge building to CR closure ("ghost's final word dissolved... shard went cold"); cost felt in relational mirror of her misfiled life. Orientation anchored early in observatory/server room. Single scene with reflective shards fits defaults, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory anchors (circuits/winter taste, ink veins, dome's glow) constrain choices like stylus-tracing and shard-screen contact. Recurring snow evolves to "quiet curtain," charging final image. Micro-setting (porcelain shard, terminal) mirrors fractures, filters via her priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetch wisdom) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via voice whisper → ink kaleidoscope → shard spark narrowing to defragmentation. Agency in pours/traces/presses forecloses path with shard-cold cost. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom from failure/cracks) emerges organically via ink/shard/ghost parallels to her certificate error, reweighting in "error... was a crack that let her see." Final image (heartbeats restored, ink drying) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like teacup shatter avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ephemeral veins, pulsing shard); rhythmic prose ("thin as radio static") modulates tension to solace. Ghost voice thin/natural; no head-hopping or elision issues. Perceptual bias ties heartbeats to machine.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figures ("ink's fleeting veins," "kaleidoscope") taught early, propels via varied rhythm; no loops but minor paraphrase in repeated fracture motifs ("broken ceramic and broken data"). Closure image clear/crisp. Minor overwriting density in peak ink shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clerical ghost + digital ghost via ink defragmentation/porcelain bridge transforms tropes organically. Shard-teacup backstory integrates lived detail; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
