<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict—mistaking silence for emptiness—manifests in clumsy hands signing back, earning his reconfiguration with the cost of perpetual forgottenness. Advisor applies crucible pressure via gentle redirection of camera. Contradictory impulses act on-page; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence images builds to advisor's signs (*Because silence is the only language...*), yielding CR/RR closure where Elias signs symphony—cost legible in "music... for the silence to remember." Orientation anchored early; lens taught by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor's pilings, water slap, moon-path constrain and mirror internal shift, charging final image; camera as micro-setting redirects gaze and becomes metronome. Sensory hierarchy (salt/forgotten smells narrowing to vibrations) reflects Elias's perceptual evolution. 9+ gate: recurring object charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eroding memory) signaled early, tightens via advisor's mapping reweighting silence—agency in Elias signing back forecloses empty shutter ritual with felt endurance cost. Escalation as textural cadence shift under lens; no micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (forgotten own silence-as-music) emerges via signing syntax turning void to verse; final spiral sign and "joyful sorrow" offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (filmless clicks to baton) drive; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (absences as photographs, silence as score); rhythmic prose modulates from stasis to "symphony... endless composition." Signing as subtextual dialogue natural; 9+ test: signature holds under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "Her hands rose... fluid geometry" weaves image/action; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Heavy figuratives consistent in lyric pattern without muddle; minor overwriting in descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via filmless camera/sign-language silence-to-music synthesis; advisor's spiral sign feels inevitable from harbor's "liquid light." Risky lyric conceit heightens stakes organically; 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability with closure risk.</comment>
