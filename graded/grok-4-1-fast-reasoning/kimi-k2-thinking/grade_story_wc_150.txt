<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "warmly curious tug" and dread/hope mix; micro-choices in wandering reveal values. Final faith mending earned via discoveries with foreclosed isolation path. Minor slip in overt "She realized" epiphany phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments builds to Charged Poise closure at sundial shadow stretching "honoring the bones below." Cost legible in "mending the thread of continuity that war had severed." Orientation anchored early in catacomb orchard return; one tightening via wedge find.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective, roots intertwining femurs constrain wandering choices and mirror internal renewal. Recurrent bone/tree details charge final image of "shadows lengthening." POV-filtered sensory hierarchy sharpens moments like sunlight on bone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild for continuity/faith) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through fragment hunts narrowing isolation options. Agency in purposeful wandering yields felt cost of past severance. Minor abstractness in stakes before wedge find.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from interruption emerges via orchard as "living archive," reweighted non-literally in final sundial sentinel image. Protagonist arc inextricable; ambiguity in "journey home... continuous unfolding" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased toward bone/root patterns and memory scents. Rhythm modulates from dread to poise; purposeful compression in rituals fits tone without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath, high density in integrated sensory/action lines. Minor paraphrase loops in "quiet" repetitions (promise, smile, tremor, certainty) across close beats dull propulsion slightly. No closure artifacts; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard transforms graveyard trope into living archive via root/bone specificity; sundial rebuild inflects fresh continuity angle. Risky lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
