<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover the trees' testimony drives consistent micro-choices like retrieving the sextant and mapping dreams, with embodied emotion in her healing scar. Internal conflict emerges subtly in confronting quantified sorrow's weight before resilience balances it. Minor slip: epiphanic shift at garden feels slightly unearned without prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from pin drop to map revelation and garden entry, with CR closure reweighting labyrinth from sorrow-trap to hope-map. Cost legible in "sum was overwhelming, yet the moonlight softened its edges." Orientation anchored early in corridor; progression fits single-scene default with purposeful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonlight as recurring micro-setting constrains healing and beam-focusing, charging final garden image where trees glow with memories. Sensory details like pin clatter, salt-stardust smell, and boot echoes filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with action. No slips; vivid, purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering trees' witness via sorrow map—tightens accumulatively as sextant reveals dreams pattern, forcing deconstruction with felt cost in grief's weight. Agency in climbing, mapping, unraveling forecloses ignorance path. Minor: no explicit trade-off narrows options sharply enough for 9-band under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow transformed into hope via mundane miracles emerges organically from map's pattern and trees' whispers, with final image ("each sweep... felt like a prayer") offering non-literal resonance. No moralizing; complexity in balancing desolation with resilience reweights premise. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic notices like "stones absorbed a measure of sorrow, quantified in silent weight." Rhythm modulates from silent tension to humming energy; purposeful diction consistent. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from inciting clatter to closure glow; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Minor overwriting in dense figuratives during healing ("time itself was rewinding") borders opacity but serves texture without harming closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified grief, healing sextant, and witnessing trees transforms labyrinth trope into inevitable hope-map revelation. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
