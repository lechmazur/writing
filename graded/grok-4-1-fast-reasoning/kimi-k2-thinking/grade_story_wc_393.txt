<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chaplain's motivation rooted in seeking purpose through the box intensifies via Marlowe's repair, earning realization; Marlowe's traits shown precisely in handling ("fingers traced the fracture lines"). Relationships crucible as interaction forces chaplain's shift. Minor flaw: interior conflict more reflective than simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to melody/light shaft reconfiguring grace as "built gear by gear." Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost in "harder work of living with what was understood." Orientation anchored early (shop entry); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust motes/music boxes selective, constrain repair choices; window light charges final image, mirroring internal states via "sun found a narrow opening." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (chaplain notes precision); no white-room, vivid economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix matter? forgiveness via legacy) signaled early, deepens via repair success narrowing to delivery; under accumulative lens, melody forces stance crystallization with cost ("not simple nor sufficient, but exactly... carried forward"). Agency in Marlowe's method, chaplain's promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-as-action emerges via repair particulars, reweighted in ending image without moralizing; subtext in silence/melody invites ambiguity on grace's sufficiency. Resonant non-literal answer: "light shot through... illuminating... the two men in its glow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (precision/light bias); voice texture distinct in syntax/rhythm ("vibrant hush," "aptly deliberate"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("This is the calm before realization"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short clicks in repair, expansive close); density high, multi-job lines. Minor overwrite: repeated motifs ("vibrant hush" thrice) purposeful but borders loop; no closure harm, coherent metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prisoner's box repair transforms redemption trope via gear-by-gear grace; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens closure image without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight: melody as "apology into action."</comment>
