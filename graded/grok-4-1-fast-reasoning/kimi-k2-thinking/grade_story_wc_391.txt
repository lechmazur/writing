<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in impatience-to-patience arc, with embodied "caged urgency" and micro-choices like calibrating sensors; minor slip in reflective summary ("taught her what her younger self could never understand") borders on unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations (moon paths, viaduct hum) builds to resonant reconfiguration closure ("The revolution did not explode. It simply... released") with legible conceptual cost in broken yoke and freed minds; orientation anchored early, one tightening via final pulse suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (viaduct's "hum... in her teeth", ice ridges) filter through Elara's mapper bias and constrain choices (boots on roughened ice, transmitter calibration); final reflection in frozen lake charges image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient revolution via alignment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through calibration to dual pulses forcing tyrant's disablement; agency in her deliberate pulses narrows options with restraint cost, coherent under lens, visible in community response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of patience as forge emerges organically from particulars (moon tracking, restrained pulses) without statement; final image of reflection reweights "horizons of possibility" non-literally, resonant with ambiguity in wildness refined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (magnetic flux as intention-mapper); rhythmic poetic diction modulates tension ("low thrum... restrained wildness"), purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in peak beats, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops on "patient revolution" and "unyoke" (e.g., repeated forging metaphors) create slight redundancy without obscuring closure, no filter stacks or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fantasy elements (polarity-shifting viaduct, lunar ice paths) transforms revolution trope via patient mechanics; risk in lyric restraint heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
