<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archivist's combative tenderness and nervous tic embodied in reverse walking and trembling pour; final choice to stay for Lin's mentorship earned via prior causality and forecloses homeland return with felt relational cost at "I could go back, but then who would teach you."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tea spill to annotation builds density toward Charged Poise closure where annotated shard glows/dances then pouched, reconfiguring exile as chosen with undeniable opportunity cost legible in imagined swing and decision to remain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hush, marble scrapes, tea steam selective via archivist's priorities; recurring swing mirrors internal resilience, constraining final image where library breathes less lonely, charging closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher shadow vs. mentor) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through successful annotation tempting freedom, forces renunciation with on-page cost in foreclosed return, crystallized in shard pouching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from tea geometry/spiral to swing arc, reweighting exile premise in final image without moralizing; combative tenderness subtext layers conflicting impulses toward quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (shadow shifts "as if recognizing"); lyrical rhythm modulates tension, dialogue subtextual ("Will this set you free?") advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (wet leaves' geometry annotated); minor paraphrase loops on "resilience/quiet" purposeful for textural build but slightly drag momentum pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea-leaf divination with shard-shadow mysticism transforms mentor-apprentice trope; reversible exile as choice risks bold quiet stasis, inevitable in hindsight via spiral motif.</comment>
