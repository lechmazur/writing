<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensibily eccentric trait yields embodied conflict in practical refusal at lagoon, earning final renunciation with empty vials as cost; contradictory impulses act in micro-choice to pour boundary rather than cross threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory densities layer to lagoon revelation; CR closure in compass abandonment reconfigures mystery stake with conceptual cost of explanations' irrelevance, legible in "precise coordinates where answers become irrelevant."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Limestone-slick ledges and still lagoon constrain delve and final stance; stalactite rhythm charges resonant hush, mirroring internal hush via petrichor drop that reveals time layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of valley's sensory truths deepens via psychometry to lagoon unveiling under textural lens; agency in petrichor drop forecloses deeper crossing with vial-emptying cost viscerally felt in pockets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sensory detours over logic emerges organically, reweighted in keeper decision where "explanations fail" crystallizes without moralizing; final empty-pocket image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scent-perceptual signature ("petrichor in this valley for seventeen years") biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression heightens immersion without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "water clarified, revealing layers of time stacked like pages" propels without loops; metaphors cohere (hinged awakening) in peak reveal, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petrichor psychometry transforms lost-expedition trope into scent-bound mystery; bold sensory hinge risks lyric closure that feels inevitable in vial-circle boundary.</comment>
