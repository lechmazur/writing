<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied calcifications of daughter's voice as crystal and pride as black stone reveal contradictory grief/pride impulses; final weaving of existence confronts unforgiven self with 17-year cost, earning release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as burden densities layer hush and fractals toward CR: "it had never been a prison, but a loom," cost legible in "seventeen years to complete."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Grotto walls' shifting fractals and lamp burner's wick-holder shadow constrain each orientation; starlight filters charge final sphere's "pale, whalebone light" and woven exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to collect burdens escalates via accumulating weights tightening spirals; agency in final suspension-weaving forecloses trap-path with solitude's visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emergent theme of measured burdens as loom-work reweights recursive trap through sphere's zero/heavy gravity; final "grotto exhaled... true silence" resonates without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature fixates on spirals/weights ("dissolved into smaller versions... containing the whole"); rhythmic compression heightens under final calcification pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose propulsion ("silence layered... ghost of a sound"); no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm charges closure exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Calcifying abstract burdens (voice/pride/existence) into measurable forms ingeniously transforms trap trope; fractal/weight synthesis feels inevitable in loom-reveal.</comment>
