<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Son's contradictory impulses—paint markers to understand cycles vs. block resurrection—earn realization in confrontation; Leo applies pressure as foil without headcount bloat. Internal voice particular via robber legacy and calm embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: markers/memories densify to charged poise CR in Leo's whisper ("Maybe some circles are meant to be broken") and son's nod, reweighting cycles with legacy-lift cost legible on page. Orientation anchored early; single scene with reflection shards fits defaults, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Circus train posters constrain marker tactics, rust spirals mirror internal cycles via POV filter, charging final "train exhaled a sigh of rust and memory." Sensory selection (sawdust footfalls, popcorn grease) purposeful and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissuade via markers) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Leo noticing symbols to verbal crystallization; agency in bill placement forecloses resurrection path with flickering ambition cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cycles theme emerges organically from markers/memories/bill without statement, resonant CR reweights resurrection as reflection in final image; ambiguity lingers in Leo's pocketed bill.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with calm perceptual signature (rust as spirals); dialogue subtextual and advancing ("the tracks only lead in circles"). Repetitive phrasing slightly erodes distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pervasive loops ("polished calm" x5, "territorial markers" paraphrased adjacently, cycle synonyms churn) dull propulsion; figurative density (e.g., "market shifted like a trapeze artist") overwrites without pattern payoff in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Robber markers refined for tech-circus dissuasion transforms legacy trope freshly; symbolic synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risking heavy lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
