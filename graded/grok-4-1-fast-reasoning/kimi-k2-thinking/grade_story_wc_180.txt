<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mender's motivation to persist in mending roots generational conflict via concrete interiority (ribbon rummage, locket note), earning daughter reconciliation; feisty trait embodied in squirrel laugh without labels. Minor flaw: daughter's late entry limits relational crucible depth, but pivotal hand-take shows earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation (rafters orchard, mender climbing) anchors by 100 words; density builds via bag discoveries to RR closure in ribbon-tied graft and daughter dialogue, reconfiguring vows with felt relational cost. No orientation debt; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring quartz eyes and rafters orchard constrain choices (polish/climb) and charge final sun-ray on ribbon; sensory hierarchy (groaning beams, rustling squirrels) filters through mender's craft bias, evolving to humming renewal. Micro-setting (rotting ladder, silver wire) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend breach, bridge wisdom) signaled early, texturally escalates via locket note deepening to daughter's shadow-arrival confrontation, forcing ribbon renunciation with emotional cost in smile/hand-clasp. One tightening suffices; agency in persist ties to closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deciduous vows theme emerges organically from leaf note ("Vows are leaves") to ribbon graft, reweighting premise in final wrist-tying without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in daughter's smile seeds orchard renewal. Dialogue echo ("let them fall... grow again") borders explicit but anchors in prior image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (chisels/sharp tongue idiom); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse daughter exchange. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why... old thing?"), advances bridge; no head-hopping, elision taught via bag.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels (resin pellet snatch interleaves action/reflection); varied rhythm breathes with emotional cadence, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrite in metaphors ("thousand new leaves") coherent under textural lens, but elevated diction slightly drifts in peak daughter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard-in-rafters premise ingeniously fuses sacred decay with craft revival; ribbon's evolution from binding to bandage transforms vow trope via specific graft/sun-ray. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in accidental wisdom closure, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
