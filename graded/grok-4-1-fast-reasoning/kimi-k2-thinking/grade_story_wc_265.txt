<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via sixth sense to becoming architect, but interiority leans abstract-epiphanic ("hum of insight reorganized her waking memories") without strong embodied contradictions acting simultaneously; earned change at "she had become its architect" redeems.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR/Charged Poise closure ("she had become its architect, able to build new groves"); cost legible in fusion ("part of the equation, not its victim"); shard biomes taught early (~120 words), no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest vividly filters through POV ("copper leaves chimed against brass bark"), with gear/recurring object constraining choice ("placed against the trunk... began to turn") and charging final image; sensory hierarchy matches insight urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover mind's wild frontier) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via translocations and tree-whispers to paradox unraveling; agency in listening/placing gear narrows options, cost felt in reconfiguration under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (wildness/mechanism as lovers, map/territory) emerges organically from particulars like gear harmony; final image ("gear still turning in her palm") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (frequencies, syntax as wind); rhythmic texture modulates insight crescendo ("hum... rose to a crescendo"); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops ("gear... turning" reprise purposeful but borders redundancy); no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest philosophy transforms tropes (e.g., forest quest) via gear/insight fusion; risk-taking in surreal shards heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at sequoia harmony.</comment>
