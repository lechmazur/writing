<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" surface cracking under thunder, compelling the pivot to write; embodied scars on tongue ground emotion. Minor unearned leap in final understanding slightly undercuts pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm density and timer clicks build to CR closure: "scars were the true cartography of survival" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of enduring secrecy. Orientation anchored early; single tightening at envelope opening pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory constrains vigil via rarefied air and rattling glass, charging final dawn image; sensory hierarchy (lightning scars mirroring internal) filters through poet's bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access unspeakable via vigil) tightens texturally through storm intensification and mask slip, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in refolding envelope as foreclosed open rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars as walked terrain emerges organically from envelope reveal and recalled poem line, offering resonant CR without moralizing; final image reweights silence motif undeniably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scar/storm/star mappings sustains rhythmic control under pressure; POV stable with lyric compression taught early and legible at timer silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion, but minor motif loops ("scars mapped," "cartography") border redundancy without obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts; purposeful overwriting in storm beats serves texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of darkroom timer and bus timetable ghosts transforms censorship trope; risk in lyric conceit heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via scar cartography.</comment>
