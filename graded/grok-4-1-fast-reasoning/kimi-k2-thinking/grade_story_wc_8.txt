<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emlyn's emotionally rational trait drives methodical actions like peeling vines, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete yet low on genuine struggle or flaws complicating choices under pressure. Final preservation decision feels earned but scales small without visible cost on pivotal discovery beat. No blind spots or degradation under stress diminish individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of decay images building to CR closure in blooming garden reweighting noble lie with conceptual cost of tarnished legacy. Orientation anchored early (rosebush petal at dusk). One tightening via letter discovery to publication decision narrows narrative options texturally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and rusted rails as recurring setting constrain exploration (peeling vines reveals ledger) and charge final image (ivy climbs to light mirroring truth). Sensory details selective through POV bias (decay parallels eroded memory). Atmosphere tensions nobility/cost without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, tightens texturally when letter reveals lie as "prison" forcing stance shift to preservation/publication with felt cost (legacy debate). Pressure coheres accumulatively but remains abstract, lacking visceral opposition or live trade-off in discovery beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically from particulars (letter's loyalty/betrayal design), resonant CR in garden blooming reweights premise without moralizing. Parallels shift meaning at end, embracing complexity (nobility acknowledged, not erased). Minor direct echoes like "rescue truth from pit" slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of parallel-drawing; rhythmic prose modulates reflectively (e.g., "heart beat with weight"). Diction purposeful, voice distinct in textured noticing of gold swirls. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("drawing parallels," "ivy") and paraphrase loops (decay-memory erosion restated across sentences) create template cadence, dulling density in reflective beats; −0.9 artifacts. Rhythm varies but overwriting metaphors (vines/serpents as loyalty) risks muddle without payoff. Propulsion clear despite loops not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Station-as-archive metaphor transforms noble lie trope through specific historian's lens, fresh synthesis in petal-to-rose arc. Risk in heavy symbolic layering heightens theme without gimmickry. Prompt-like repetition ("rescue truth") hedges boldness slightly.</comment>
