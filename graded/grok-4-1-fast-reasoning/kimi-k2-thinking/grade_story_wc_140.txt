<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Survivor's motivation to tactilely reconstruct erased memories drives micro-choices like layering fragments, earning closure realization; embodied contradiction in "dangerous, sealed, poison" shards reveals desperate interiority without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early fragment collection to CR closure at "He writes this on the back of the poison label," reweighting erasure with undeniable conceptual cost of anchored existence; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grid's corrugated vents and tidal concrete constrain collecting and charge final box image, with sensory bleed ("colors bleed at the edges") mirroring POV bias; micro-setting of rusted tackle box evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory texture deepens accumulatively via poison label personalization ("his own, from a life that supposedly ended"), forcing endurance with legible cost in "metal filing cabinets slamming shut"; single tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of concentrated erasures emerges organically from layered shards, with final "salt on skin" image resonating non-literally on nameless state's stakes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature ("sounds arrive with echoes of futures that never happened"), rhythmic modulation heightens textural pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in purposeful "texture" refrain propels without loops; varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm support lyric accumulation, minor figurative density in peak beats contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh bureaucratic-ghost premise transformed via tactile fragment topology in container maze; risky poetic synthesis inevitable at tidal-charged closure.</comment>
