<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to expose sabotage and break Voss's control drives micro-choices like measuring rust and ignoring calls, with embodied vulnerability contrasting calm observation. Internal conflict emerges in "fortified vulnerability" amid pressure, but label-speak slightly abstracts peak resolve. Final upload earned by evidence accumulation, foreclosing compliance path with retribution cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory details and evidence density build to Charged Poise closure in uploading evidence and clutching lantern, reweighting control vs. truth with felt retribution cost ("threat of retribution"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mara in tunnel post-drought). Single scene coherent, no shards; sabotage discovery tightens without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp rust, drips, and gloom filter through investigator's gauge and boots, constraining observations (etching revealed by lantern). Water and shadows mirror resolve, with lantern as micro-setting charging final clutch image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency; spatial choreography tracks cleanly to exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose negligence vs. Voss control) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via loosened bolts, scuff marks, ignored calls narrowing to upload decision. Agency in empirical choices forces trade-off; phone buzzes heighten pressure coherently. Cost legible in voicemail anger and "weight of vulnerability" charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of past fortifying present truth emerges organically from lantern/etching and water-as-truth image, reweighting complicity without statement. Entangled memories interlace conflicts subtly; final "truth would rise like water" offers non-literal resonance to control question. Complexity in moral stand against power lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (rust patterns, fracture lines) biased to investigator's eye. Voice texture poetic yet grounded, rhythm modulates from descriptive calm to terse resolve ("let the phone's persistent ring reverberate unanswered"). No dialogue; minor elevated diction fits but borders register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "lantern's flame flickered" and "vulnerability" (three variants in final third) dull closure image, with synonym churn on memories/resolution. Density strong but overwriting in "entangled memories surged" mixes metaphors slightly. Rhythm varies well; syntax propels to exit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underground railroad lantern linking historical escape to modern whistleblowing transforms investigator trope organically. Sabotage discovery amid post-drought water infuses specificity; risk in quiet defiance heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
