<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries to earned resolve in writing scene; interiority concrete via memory surfacing from photos. "Precisely humane" trait shown in deliberate footsteps and care for history, but label mention slightly undercuts embodiment. No contradictory impulses in peak beats limit 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: discoveries (label, photos) build density to memory tightening, culminating in on-page CR closure when "weight of the past lift[s]" after writing, with conceptual cost of rewriting history legible. Orientation anchored early (Nora on ridgeway by para 1). Lens holds cleanly to charged final image of lantern-truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reservoir, mud, rusted tower constrain choices via exposed artifacts; sensory details (damp earth scent, coyote call) selective through Nora's historical bias. Sapphire label and lantern light charge final image, mirroring internal resurrection. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover/share truth) signaled early, accumulates via finds to deepening memory reversal narrowing options to expunge/write. Agency in gathering/writing forecloses denial with felt cost ("weight...lift"). Under accumulative lens, density reweights stake effectively, though no overt trade-off caps at 8.7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths resurfacing emerges organically via water/silence motifs shifting to shared memory. Final image ("truth like a lantern") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting history's hush without moralizing. Particulars like sapphire glow avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (historical noticing in landscape). Lyrical diction/rhythm consistent, modulates with resolve; no head-hopping or leakage. Elevated phrasing fits voice but occasional uniformity in image-heavy sentences prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("mirrored hush," sapphire) building pattern without loops; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak writing beat ("perfume of resurrection") risks slight overwrite but doesn't obscure closure. No scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned-town trope via artifact-driven truth-reveal and lyric water-memory weave. Risky accumulative lyricism heightens resonance without gimmick; ridgeway discoveries feel inevitable from setup. Avoids templates through specific distillery poisoning angle.</comment>
