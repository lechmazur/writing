<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect wall stories is rooted in traits like believing walls listen, compelling the probe despite dismissal; interiority concrete in trembling hands during diary pattern. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; endurance feels earned but lacks micro-choice hierarchy reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via discovery-diaries-pattern-realization; CR closure in "Elias had become the walls' newest story" reweights dreams' migration with conceptual cost of eternal preservation amid dreamless world. Orientation anchored early in silo; lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silo's "bronze cylinder of rusted metal," dust-thick air, and walls constrain probe (sealed fireplace) and charge closure via molecular memory absorption. Tapestry dragons recur to mirror dreams, filtering through Elias's perceptual bias; sensory hierarchy sharpens under discovery urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe wall stories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diaries' dragon pattern matching tapestry, narrowing to dreams-in-matter realization; agency in cataloguing forecloses forgetting with cost of becoming "newest story." One tightening sufficient, cost legible in final hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of displaced dreams migrating to matter emerges via particulars (diaries, tapestry, walls); final image non-literally answers by reconfiguring imagination's vessels without moralizing. Resonance from pattern shift, inviting ambiguity on preservation's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ghost sensitivity ("probe their secrets"); diction/rhythm modulates from methodical to trembling insight, lyrical texture purposeful under accumulative lens. No head-hopping, elision taught via walls' hush paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (dust-thick air slows, fluttering tapestry accelerates); high density propels without loops. Minor figurative density ("charred at the edges like moth wings") in discovery beat borders overwrite but patterns to dragon motif payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of axis-shifted dreamless world where walls store final visions transforms post-apocalypse trope via molecular migration; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, tapestry-dragons inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
