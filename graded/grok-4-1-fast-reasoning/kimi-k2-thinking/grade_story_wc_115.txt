<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skeptical trait constrains choices like dismissing wheel whispers yet twisting it anyway, driving internal conflict to earned release; embodied emotions in hammering heart and chest-clogging weight; final renunciation of silence feels compelled by father's backstory cued to present wheel-handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure in wheel-twist dissolving ghosts into beads, reweighting truth with memory-cost legible in "ghost shift would ride home... as memory's mass"; orientation anchored early in tunnel creep; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's warmer fork and scraping door constrain path to sub-basement climax; beaded wheel as recurring micro-setting charges final lap-image with 37-soul count; sensory hierarchy (damp breath, spectral dust) reflects appraising POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weighing swallowed truth tightens accumulatively via radio shrieks and ghost materialization forcing wheel-twist agency; cost felt in foreclosed silence, carrying spectral memory; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of confession's mass emerges via bead-soul equivalence without statement, resonant in final wheel-wink reweighting hush heavier than fire; ambiguity in skeptical release invites reflection; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "appraising" lens and drowsy rhythms; radio voices carry subtext without head-hopping; syntax modulates tension from creeping to snapping focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Purposeful motif repetition (weight, hush) builds texture but paraphrase loops like repeated "swallowed truth" variants dull mid-climax density; figurative density in ghost-beat ("threadbare hair... hollow as confession booths") coherent yet overwrites propulsion; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-psychic frenzy amplifying beaded wheel's time-reverse lock/key transforms mill-ghost trope; risk in poetic accumulation pays off in CR without gimmick.</comment>
