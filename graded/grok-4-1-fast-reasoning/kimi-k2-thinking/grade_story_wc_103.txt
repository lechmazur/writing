<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in obsession driving mapping despite entrapment, earned by halo press to temple; final disintegration renunciation forecloses escape with embodied cost in cellular unfolding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ghostly layers builds to CR closure at "She understood too late that to discover it fully was to become it," with legible conceptual cost in her dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's hyperbolic curves constrain alignment attempts and charge final image where bridges absorb her; "cedar arches intertwined with willow-bark pathways that pulsed with sap" filters through designer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to navigate time via geometry tightens texturally through ancestor reveal and knot-twisting bridges; agency in holding fragment aloft forces disintegration trade-off with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-nourishment emerges implicitly via photos feeding roots; final blended faces in photographs offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting discovery's peril without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in geometric-organic diction like "question mark of roots and vines"; rhythmic control modulates to charged poise in disintegration beat, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density with propulsion in "each cell unfolding into a surface that was simultaneously everywhere"; metaphors cohere without muddle, rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and temporal texture feels inevitable in hindsight; risk in conceptual premise heightens stakes via garden's responsive memory without gimmickry.</comment>
