<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in blood-bound inheritance and intensifies through visions, compelling the seed ritual; contradictory impulses in gentle/relentless pull embodied well. Minor slips in diagnostic tells like "She knew the choice was clear" slightly undercut peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from egg hatch to seed spiral and vortex visions; CR closure lands in "understood the texture... warmth of possibility" with cost legible in dual futures (ice vs. garden). Orientation anchored early in atrium setup; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and starlight constrain choices via frozen soil/seeds and fading light droplet; sensory selection mirrors urgency (frost retreat). Final sprout charges image, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen vortex before ice claims) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hatch triggering entropy reversal and visions forcing sustainment; agency in scattering seeds forecloses collapse path with on-page cost in fragile time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of wild serenity/borrowed time emerges via seed/vortex images, resonating in final laugh blending voices. Weakness: explicit articulations like "wild serenity is the pulse... fierce and calm" create thematic echo, diluting subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward natural spirals/light; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative rise. Capped by Q7 artifacts; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops on "wild serenity" (5+ uses), "furiously tranquil," "borrowed time," and "vortex inheritance" create paraphrase churn, especially in ending realizations; overwriting with metaphors in every high-pressure sentence dulls propulsion. Heavy artifacts disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh entropy-reversal via seeds/vortex time weaves organic fantasy; visions transform tropes into textured futures. Risky lyric density heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
