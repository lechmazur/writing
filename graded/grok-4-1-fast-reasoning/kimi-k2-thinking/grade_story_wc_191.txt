<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in lore keeper traditions culminates in earned renunciation at the throne, with "wisely adventurous" trait constraining the pivotal pause; embodied stress via fraying chronoshawl adds depth. Minor slip in label-like trait repetition slightly undercuts interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as peeling layers accumulate coordinates to stairway revelation; closure as RR via ruby placement reconfigures throne's purpose with shawl-dissolving cost on-page. Continuous shard progression fits scope; orientation anchored early in acid rain and transitway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting specifics like nano-tube graffiti strata and stasis orchard constrain peeling method and time pressure, charging final trembling waterfall image. Sensory integration (static charge tingle, humming steps) mirrors internal pattern-seeking without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prepare throne by sunrise) tightens via deepening realization it's a heir's test, forcing renunciation agency with fraying shawl cost. Timeframe pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, narrowing options without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal over reclamation emerges organically via murals shifting from fall to return and fruit as tomorrow fragments; final child-dream image offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing, ambiguity in her freedom lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of patterns in decay (graffiti strata, shifting pigments); rhythmic texture modulates from journey propulsion to closure poise. Elevated diction fits futuristic nostalgia without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Near-paraphrase loop in "peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" (tunnel and observatory) dulls density slightly; lush metaphors purposeful for textural lens but border overwriting in "fruit that glowed like memory." Strong propulsion overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of layered murals as data-map and stasis orchard throne-test transforms tropes; "throne waited, no longer unclaimed but prepared" reweighting feels inevitable from particulars. Risky poetic compression heightens nostalgic ingenuity.</comment>
