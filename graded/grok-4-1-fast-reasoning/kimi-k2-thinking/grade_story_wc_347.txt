<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance clashes vividly with duty in her curse and grandmother's voice memory, driving micro-choices like precise nut placements under time pressure. Internal conflict embodies in pounding heart against desire to abandon travelers. Earned endurance in final retreat shows cost of isolation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shadow chain builds density from first nut to faint final one, creating RR closure as travelers emerge and Elara retreats to loneliness. One tightening via encroaching frost narrows options. Orientation anchors early; cost legible in "retreated among the whispering trees."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard and labyrinth constrain choices—sunset shadows, frost-slick stones force precise timing. Recurrent nut charges final faint shadow image. Sensory details (whispers, clicking wings, crystalline frost) filter through Elara's reluctant familiarity, mirroring isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bird veers and fading sun to force trade-off in final nut use. Agency in offhand placements forecloses abandonment path. Cost felt in her loneliness versus travelers' relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant duty balancing poison/precision emerges organically from shadow signals and isolation; final image reconfigures "graceless in her duty, beautiful in its execution" as non-literal answer to inherited burden. Subtext in unseen savior role lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: Elara's biased noticing of roots, nuts, frost under reluctance. Prose texture modulates rhythm from lazy precision to faster breath. No head-hopping; voice particular in lines like "wishing just once that she could let them fumble."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length for urgency; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause-effect. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("roots gripped stone like desperate fingers") slightly muddles one early beat but doesn't touch closure. Propulsion clear in shadow-chain sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, shadow blueprints commanding clockwork birds transforms guardian trope via precise non-touch mechanics. Risk in graceless beauty tone heightens isolation stakes. Inevitable in hindsight from nut grooves to final reconfiguration.</comment>
