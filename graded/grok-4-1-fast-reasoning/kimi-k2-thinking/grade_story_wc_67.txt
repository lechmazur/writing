<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in ash's warmth and drifting particles reveals contradictory pursuit of crystallized safety amid acknowledged mirage; micro-choices like powdering the mask earn final acceptance with felt grief cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("weaves truth carefully") borders abstraction but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: motif density (ash, blur, vanishing point) builds to CR closure in "gallery's facade seems to dissolve," reweighting safety premise with impermanence cost legible in final ash-scatter image. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt; one tightening via shimmer-to-blur suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's vanishing point pulls vision during powdering, constraining choice and charging closure; sensory selectivity (burnt paper, cedar ghost) mirrors internal blur without catalog. Recurring chair and drizzle evolve tactilely, bodies navigate lived-in space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallize safety) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as ash shimmers then blurs vision/walls, forcing endurance of escape with on-page cost in unheld grief. Agency in powdering and leaving forecloses solidification path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanent illusions emerges organically from ash-settling failure and gallery dissolution; final image ("ash mingles with rain") offers non-literal resonance, reweighting mirage without moralizing. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in ash/memory filters; rhythmic modulation (short closure sentences) heightens poise. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (lulling opens to dissolving cadence); motifs like "somber marvel" pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure. Minor mixed vehicles ("ghost of cedar," "tiny mirrors") cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh ash-on-porcelain ritual transforms grief tropes via gallery's optical logic; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight dissolve image.</comment>
