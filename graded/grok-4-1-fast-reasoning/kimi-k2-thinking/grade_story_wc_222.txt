<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied curiosity replacing fear at heart-lifting moment; micro-choices like reverent piece placement reveal contradictory thief-chivalry impulses acting simultaneously. Earned change to guardian with felt cost in "burden and gift." Minor archetype lean without deeper flaws limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: spire call → puzzle → unlock → mend → sky heal as DC/RR with legible cost in heart's weight. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early ("icebound spire above the clouds"). Closure image reconfigures thief to guardian indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (hum through boots, ice splintering) constrain navigation and charge final "spire singing" image. Micro-setting (chessboard, frozen gears) guides precise choices. POV bias toward wonder filters perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend heart before sky tears) signaled early, tightens causally via puzzle success enabling shaft access. Agency in alignments forecloses failure path; cost felt in "cracked and dim" heart's burden. No further reversal needed, but abstract scale slightly mutes visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of playful wonder amid unknown emerges organically via chess secrets and lid's time-mend; final descent reweights thievery as guardianship without moralizing. Resonant CR in sky's "secret smile." Repetitive affirmations ("embrace with open arms") border echo without deepening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (constellations shifting, whispers when tilted). Rhythmic prose modulates tension, peaks in harmonic chord. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion early, but final third paraphrase loops ("ready for the next wrong sky," repeated thief/guardian bows, wonder echoes) dull closure image (−0.8). Minor template cadence in closing sentences; density high otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess secrets unlock frozen starlight shaft, sundial lid mends crystalline heart—transforms thief trope via wonder apprenticeship. Risky lyric fantasy pays off in charged poise without gimmickry. Q7 debt caps higher.</comment>
