<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in grief drives deliberate micro-choices like slow pattern creation; embodied patience contradicts urging haste in "felt the world's held breath press against her skin." Minor abstract epiphany at grove ("sealing of sorrow") borders unearned insight, but closure endurance feels causal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to CR closure in child's discovery, reweighting loss into geometry with legible emotional cost at "boundary between grief and hope blur." Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (crunched leaves, ice crack) filter through alchemist's priorities; orchard supplies discarded items constraining sigil choice, charging final cabin image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heartbeat map to child) signaled early; accumulative deepening via ritual tightens pressure, agency in sealing forecloses grief path with on-page emotional cost at pulsing memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-hope transformation emerges organically from particulars like starlight sigil; resonant CR ending reweights stillness/motion without moralizing, blurring boundaries in final pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with alchemical perceptual signature (patterns as language); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports propulsion; high density integrates image/action, but patterned "stillness" repetition (4x) borders minor loop without obscuring closure flare or child reunion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual translating heartbeats via starlight in crater orchard; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pattern motif.</comment>
