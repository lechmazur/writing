<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation burns clear and intensifies through embodied spectral sensations like the "bruised fruit" heart and hot pull cord, compelling balanced choices that earn her thinning form as closure cost; contradictory impulses act in easing the grip to avoid madness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as wind density and echoes build to Charged Poise closure where handle dissolves and form thins with legible absence cost; orientation anchored instantly in tunnel post-death; single scene tightens meaningfully without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel constrains sound tactics and charges final image of persisting music; sensory details like "slick with memory and groundwater" filter through spectral bias, mirroring internal thaw; micro-setting via cord/handle evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore laughter escalates accumulatively via intensifying wind/lullabies prompting Sarah's plate shatter/laugh, forcing Eleanor's agency in softening to balance; cost unmistakable in moderated sorrow center "solid enough to rebuild."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of haunting as tender maceration emerges organically from wind-apologies and thawing voices, reweighting silence in final tunnel persistence image without moralizing; subtext in unsaid grief layers via earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single spectral POV with perceptual signature like "spectral bones" and biased noticing of household above; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in wind gusts; no head-hopping despite Sarah glimpses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like wind conjuring lullabies; metaphors cohere (kazoos choir, damp plaster grief) without muddle; minor repetition of "macerated"/"pull cord handle" purposeful but caps from overwriting in peak echo beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leaf blower ghost in tunnel transforms haunting trope via off-key wind mechanics growing inevitably to thaw; risk in spectral physics pays off in closure without gimmick.</comment>
