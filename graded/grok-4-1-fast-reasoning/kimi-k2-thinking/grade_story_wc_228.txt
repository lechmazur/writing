<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent nostalgic traits drive the promise fulfillment, with painting act embodying internal conflict between detachment and commitment. Interiority leans abstract and poetic rather than concretely particular, diluting embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and memory layers build to Charged Poise closure when shell glows in light and past weight lifts with felt emotional cost. Wrong turn tightens via motivated ellipsis to oasis; orientation anchors early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shaft of light and pool constrain painting choice and charge final image, with brine-scented caves mirroring internal release. Sensory selection purposefully narrows in oasis climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise fulfillment deepens accumulatively via wrong turn to ideal site, forcing stance crystallization in renunciation of shell. Pressure internal and mild, lacking sharper trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of revealed promises emerges organically from mirror crack, shell, and oasis images, with final ledge placement reweighting memory's hold non-literally. Avoids moralizing but borders overt resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature in light/shadow noticing; rhythmic prose modulates for introspective pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("temporary eternity," "hidden," "reveal," "painted seashell") across climax and end create paraphrase churn and dull propulsion in oasis beat. Figurative density overwrites key strokes without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in wrong turn yielding seashell's "reveal" transforms nostalgia trope into textured epiphany. Risks poetic excess but integrates organically.</comment>
