<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: Elara's contradictory "screaming tenderness" embodied in cork-handling and ritual choice earns Marcus's transformation; flaws (his fear of silence) complicate without hedging. Final hand-touch reveals hierarchy of values with relational cost. Voice distinct in perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vibrations/scent builds to Charged Poise closure ("he reached out... trembling") with undeniable emotional cost legible in "voice cracked and raw." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via cork-ritual suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and cork-as-micro-setting constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (salt air, cork vibrations) POV-filtered and purposeful. Dawn light evolves with action, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers > shouts) tightens via scent-ritual deepening under Accumulative lens, foreclosing Marcus's shouting path with felt relational price ("boots silent... trembling"). Agency in Elara's micro-choice; cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of intention-over-voice emerges organically from cork, vibrations, lighthouse; final "teach me how to listen" reconfigures premise non-literally with ambiguity (tomorrow's silence). Particulars (jasmine ghost) resist tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature (vibrations/scent bias) character-specific; dialogue sparse but subtext-rich ("Tomorrow... we begin with silence") advances closure. Rhythm modulates with intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm ("thunderclap that split the sky like a cracked bell"); minor overwrite in opening metaphors risks density slip but spares closure. No loops, clean syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as intent-filter with cork's scent-memory transforms communication trope; risk in magical realism pays off via grounded ritual, heightening stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
