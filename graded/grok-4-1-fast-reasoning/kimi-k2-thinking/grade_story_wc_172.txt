<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses in ruthless drought orchestration clashing with sentimental relic-hoarding, embodied in tracing cracks while imagining displaced villagers; final endurance of guilt forecloses moral reckoning with felt cost. Minor slip in occasional label-speak like "amoral truth gnawed" but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to egg release as CR, reweighting preservation premise via undeniable conceptual cost of buried drought in "the cost of the manufactured drought would remain buried"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, one continuous scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt flat's cracks-as-map constrain path to hollow and charge final image of rain-erased fissures holding "a new silence"; sensory selectivity (crunching boots, humming depression) mirrors Vesper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of echo preservation tightens via map-following to release, forcing trade-off with drought's human cost legible in "villages... leaving behind only dust and silence"; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at note's spiral reweights with agency-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-preservation duality emerges organically from egg's note amid thunder-lull, offering non-literal resonant answer in museum's ghostly melody contrasting villagers' silence; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in Vesper's unreadable face.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in fractured, poetic noticing (e.g., "fissures... silhouette of a bird's wing"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive poise to charged intensity at release, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in "cracks" and "echo" recurrences slightly dull mid-section texture without obscuring closure image of "echo mingled with the storm"; rhythm varies purposefully for lyric cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropy via sonic relic from eco-crime transforms tropes organically; egg-release turn feels inevitable from crack-map setup, bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
