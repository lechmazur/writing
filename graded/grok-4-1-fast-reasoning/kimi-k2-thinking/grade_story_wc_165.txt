<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ezra's analytical traits and selfish motivation drive consistent interventions with embodied actions like rigging machines and dropping the bishop, earning his satisfaction; micro-choices reveal values effectively. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore interventions (glint draws boy, quarter leads to game, sound attracts woman); on-page CR closure in bishop's pulsing warmth reconfigures control-over-randomness premise with felt unpredictability cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (salt-worn railing, black water pulsing starlight, claw machine glint) filter through Ezra's geometric gaze and constrain positioning/observations; arcade geography charges final tidal dance image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of engineering serendipity tightens via time pressure and guard threat (redirected by prior setup), narrowing options; agency in interventions escalates density under causal lens with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of calculated wilderness emerges organically from chess interventions yielding chaos-to-art shift; final bishop warmth offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with analytical perceptual signature ("mental chessboard," "diagonal slice"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, dialogue natural/subtextual ("Bishop" retreat).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated images; "lightly attentive [noun]" template repeats thrice dulling rhythm in key beats, minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of equilibrist puppeteering arcade chaos via chess algorithms feels inevitable; risk-taking in causal orchestration heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
