<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in father's legacy vs. her logic drives micro-choices like subway traversal and overlay; embodied emotions via scents/memories. Internal conflict surfaces in thrill of "theoretically rebellious act." Minor diagnostic summary in realization ("language of existence") slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrawl discoveries build density to CR closure where lantern/map reconciles worlds with conceptual cost ("teach the beauty...without the pain"). Orientation anchored early (library, Lila, father's death). Shards (library-subway-library-room) transition legibly; one tightening via overlay suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory weave (clover-melancholy scent, mica glow in tunnels) filters through POV bias; lantern as micro-setting constrains choices (decoding, illumination) and charges final image. Subway scars and hidden corridor guide action purposefully. No white-room; evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile randomness/logic) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scrawl density to ending CR; agency in interpreting/overlaying forecloses reckless path with felt cost (promise vs. father's loss). Price legible in final whisper. Coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of chance/certainty emerges organically from scrawls/deck fusion; final image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Lucid contradictions motif reweights via particulars. Minor echo risk in "lucid contradiction" phrase, but earned through events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (probability lens on scrawls: "hidden Markov chain"); rhythmic prose modulates (short jolts in subway, breathing echoes in corridor). No dialogue; voice poetic yet controlled, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overwrites high-pressure beats ("breathe with dust and old paper," "pulse of a gambler's heart") without crisp pattern payoff (−0.5); minor paraphrase loops ("cryptic scrawls" thrice early). Rhythm varies; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: probability decoding gambler scrawls to hidden library gambler sanctum transforms tropes via mica-map ingenuity. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; closure reweight inevitable from particulars.</comment>
