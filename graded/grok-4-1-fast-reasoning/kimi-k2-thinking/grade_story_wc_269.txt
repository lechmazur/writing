<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in witnessing loss, embodied via tapping and memory fragments; earned endurance in final acceptance of cycles shows character depth. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal assembly beat slightly tempers; reflective mode suits but doesn't fully hit 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of tides/tapping/bleaching densify to CR closure ("Now she understood why some paths disappear") with conceptual cost of changed assumptions legible in revelation line. Orientation anchored early (station, post-ban); one tightening via data assembly suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating disc station, railing, archive vividly constrain reflection and assembly; recurring tide gauge charges final image of "rising in a periodically eternal climb." Sensory hierarchy (tactile taps, visual white corals) reflects Lina's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ignored data to foreclose old assumptions; agency in tracing/tapping narrows interpretive options. Revelation forces trade-off (accept loss vs chart new), but subtle pressure lacks visceral price in assembly peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lost paths from shifted assumptions emerges organically via atlas lane/coral parallels; final tapping image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "paths built on a future that no longer exists" invites ambiguity on resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing (taps as questions); voice texture modulates from haunting memory to hopeful cadence. Lyrical compression taught early via tapping pattern pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm mirroring taps/tides; intentional repetition ("periodically eternal") pattern-taught without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in reflection beats ("tapped a rhythm," "each tap a question") dull mid-section slightly but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh post-ban eco-reflection synthesizes vanished lanes/bleaching via atlas anchor; tapping as thinking tool transforms trope of environmental witness. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
