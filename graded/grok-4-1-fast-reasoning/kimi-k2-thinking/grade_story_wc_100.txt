<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (leave after "last task" vs. stubborn refusal) act in scene, earning transformation into eternal keeper with visible bodily cost ("form becoming part of the library's architecture"). Interiority concrete via silted hands and marrow-whispers; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from package to lens hum to coordinates builds to CR closure ("stubbornness had built not an escape, but an eternal occupation") with conceptual cost of self-trapping legible in final image. Orientation anchored early ("sunken city of Marea"); one tightening via dream-method suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impossible atrium constrains rebuild choice and charges final shadow-stretch; silt-hands, air-pockets evolve tactilely through action, mirroring internal neither/nor state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-rest vs. personal escape) signaled early, tightens via transformation/body-cost under Accumulative lens, forcing renunciation of departure with eternal arrivals as felt price in closing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-inflicted eternity emerges organically from stubborn rebuild; final image resonant CR reweights "peace" as chased minnow, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (waterlogged histories, marrow-voices); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, though occasional elevated diction borders POV lexicon in peak rebuild.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; figurative layering ("shadow stretching like permanent fixture") purposeful in Accumulative mode without muddle, though minor synonym churn ("stubbornness" variants) in reflection lightly drags mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned-library beacon transforms lighthouse trope via soul-addresses; risk of poetic underwater eternalism heightens stakes inevitably to CR hindsight.</comment>
