<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Archetypal saxophonist lacks contradictory impulses or embodied stress during climax playing; motivation clear but interiority poetic and abstract rather than particular, with no micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of silence building to fray prophecy; on-page Conceptual Repricing closure ("prophecy dissolved, leaving only a quiet, vivid memory") legible with nostalgic cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dewdrops and prism atrium constrain prophecy/hush tactics and charge fading radiance image; selective sensory integration (muted sounds, refracted colors) mirrors internal hush without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy tightens texturally as silence deepens/warps light, forcing prophetic fray with agency in notes; cost felt in "heart heavy with eerie nostalgia" post-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence overpowering voiced destiny emerges organically via hush dissolving colors/prophecy; final dimming grotto reweights silence's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with misty perceptual bias stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to hush; repetition risks opacity but pattern-taught as textural hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and verbatim repeats ("vested hush," "prism atrium in mist," "eerie nostalgia") across final third dull closure image; template cadence in stacked descriptions obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sax silence hushing dewdrop prophecy via negative space transforms mystic trope organically; risk-taking in textural hush heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
