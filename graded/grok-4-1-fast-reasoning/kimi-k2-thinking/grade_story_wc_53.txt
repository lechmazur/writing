<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the ghost encounter ("hesitated, the weight of regret pulling me back, but the resolute scavenger...stepped forward"), earning the collaboration with the cost of accepting erosion visibly paid in weaving fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fragment density building to Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("we have become collaborators...negotiating peace"); child's voice fragment and wheel spin provide the decisive tightening with legible cost of irrecoverable loss ("cannot undo what is eroded"). Orientation anchors immediately in carousel halt and lagoon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lagoon and carousel horse constrain choices (gathering fragments from surface, sitting to trace cracks mirroring past); reflection in lagoon charges final image of unburdened self, with sensory selectivity (rippling energy, whisper of stories) reflecting scavenger's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct self via negotiation) signaled early tightens accumulatively through fragment discovery and ghost invitation, forcing agency in clutching wheel and weaving; cost unmistakable in foreclosed soaring dreams, charging final collaboration image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through fractured weaving emerges organically from particulars; final image ("spin the wheel, weaving my own narrative") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting eroded ambitions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature (stories as "dew" clinging, "stone in my throat"); rhythmic modulation under pressure (short clicks echoing heart) heightens introspection without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (wheel spins, fragments) propels accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops on "fragments" and stacked metaphors ("leaves in a wind," "candle flame") slightly dull peak ghost beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carousel-lagoon scavenging and self-ghost negotiation transforms introspection trope via camera wheel's tactile evolution; risk-taking in fractured lyricism heightens stakes inevitably toward collaborative stasis.</comment>
