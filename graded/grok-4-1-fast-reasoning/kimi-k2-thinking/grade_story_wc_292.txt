<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in trembling override ("idealism warring with the spongey dread"); earned shift to "crystalline purpose" with embodied cost; director forces micro-choice without dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via journal/nail discoveries tightening to valley reveal; Charged Poise closure in "instruments gleamed in sudden sunlight" with conceptual cost of "lie collapsing" legible; orientation anchored early at corkboard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Melting camp constrains deck choice and charges final image ("weather instruments from the 1880s... gleamed"); "thawed permafrost and something organic and wrong" filters via POV urgency; wind's "frozen claws" evolves with reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (honor truth vs protocols) deepens at override alarms narrowing to director confrontation; reveal forecloses termination path with dread's spread as felt cost; agency in pointing crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerging camp reweights erasure theme non-literally; "brave women being finally, properly buried" offers resonant CR with ambiguity in warming nail; dread motif accumulates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "wet wool in her lungs" and map-filtered details; rhythm modulates to short bursts at console ("alarms screamed red"); minimal dialogue natural, subtext in librarian's "Look at what she found."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("ghost of Vance's camp emerging... like a developing photograph"); varied rhythm propels to "crystalline purpose"; dread repetitions purposeful for tone, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Climate shift unveiling reversible exile transforms lost-explorer trope via nail's transmission; "station built on Vance's original coordinates" yields fresh synthesis charging hindsight inevitability.</comment>
