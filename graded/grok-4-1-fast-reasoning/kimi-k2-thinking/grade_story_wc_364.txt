<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ren's meekness evolves through embodied defiance—"chest tighten with a defiance"—to earned barter of rings, showing contradictory impulses in the council whisper and mine deliberation; final renunciation forecloses his shielded self with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore: council speech → silk discovery → archives → mine → barter DC with ring dissolution as legible cost in heart-chamber; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity, closure charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Azure dust and blue mineral recur to constrain quest (dust signals decay, mine ore awakens arches), charging final image of sealed cracks; sensory details (mossy entrance, glittering walls) filter via Ren's blacksmith priorities, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save orchards) tightens causally through research deepening knowledge and mine agency narrowing to barter trade-off; cost unmistakable in "fabric tightened, absorbing the metal... grief turned inside-out," agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via loss emerges organically from barter and final fruit "tasted of copper and courage"; Ren's council line borders echo but reweights via prior particulars without moralizing, resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (hammer as conductor, silk "humming"); rhythmic control peaks in barter—"looped the silk... raised his hammer"—lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm (short punchy mine steps vs. flowing silk river); metaphors cohere (blue snow → azure veins), propel climax without overwriting; ear-test flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes—meek smith barters inheritance for planetary magic—feels inevitable via mine/ silk logic; transforms hero's journey through quiet defiance risk, no derivatives.</comment>
