<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's spatially gifted perception renders breaches as "three-dimensional sculpture of light and shadow," grounding interiority in concrete traits that drive micro-choices like deactivating alarms. Motivation intensifies credibly from detection to reprogramming, with embodied contradiction in guarding "grief they didn't own but understood." Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("physics of letting go") avoids heavier penalty as it's anchored to the woman's whisper and Kael's action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of intrusion ("every third night") build to CR closure in reprogramming alarms as "testament," reweighting security premise with conceptual cost of permeable grief legible in "naming them 'Permeable Grief Architecture.'" Orientation anchors early (4:47 AM, Sector Twelve). Single scene fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent "caps pulsing in slow, cyan rhythms" and "mycelium membranes" as "curtains of living silk" constrain Kael's navigation and charge final image of "threads of memory woven through substrate." Sensory hierarchy reflects expertise (spore-laced air, heat signature 7-B). Micro-setting (fruiting body) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure farm vs. intrusion pattern) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Kael's entry and realization, narrowing to stance crystallization in protocols with felt cost of "some boundaries existed only to be crossed." Agency in decision to confront forecloses absolute security path. Minor abstractness in stakes avoids cap as dramatized in woman's photo placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of permeable grief emerges from particulars (photo at fruiting body, mycelium "remembers"), resonant in CR final image of "absence could bear fruit" without moralizing. Subtext in "laser pointer...tool for mapping love's persistence" reweights prior barriers motif. Slight overtness in repeated "physics of letting go" dings from peak 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spatial metaphors ("spiral logic of grief, the fractal repetition") biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from precise ("5:12 AM") to lyric ("quiet wildfire"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("My wife cultivated this strain"). Stable close-third POV; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "red dot danced across mycelium membranes" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Paraphrase loops on "permeable barriers" (4+ instances) and synonym churn ("echo," "signature") subtract without touching closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peak; read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom farm security as grief architecture transforms tropes (intruder reveal) through spatial/mycelial logic; "mycelium remembers" inflects non-obvious moral calculus on letting go. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; closure feels inevitable from early patterns.</comment>
