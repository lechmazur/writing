<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation over freeing/destroying the ghost, earned by prior code-tracing and note-playing; final choice to play last note forecloses perpetual muse with felt cost of solitude, embodied in cold cello neck and hovering bow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as note density escalates water patterns, lantern dimming, ink bleeding to Charged Poise closure; playing final note dissolves program and flares lanterns, reconfiguring spaces with undeniable cost of ghost's departure on the exact line "The lanterns flared once... then died."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flooded pit and lanterns constrain choices by mapping code to submerged architecture; recurring water ripples evolve with notes to charge final image of dissolved program and evaporated ghosts, sensory hierarchy musical and urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel/play code tightens accumulatively via each note's reversal (ripples disrupt, shadows pool, pressure builds); agency in hesitation/renunciation forces trade-off, cost legible in ghost's release altering inspiration's source.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory in decay emerges organically from water-stained diagrams and notes filling unstruck hush; final image of spaces "filled with possibility rather than mourning" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("water lapped... like a tide of forgotten melodies") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early, no head-hopping, diction biased to cellist seeing temporal folds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action, but minor paraphrase loops in "wordless conversation" and "in between spaces" repetitions slightly dull mid-beats; closure image clean, rhythm varies purposefully without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost code via water-damaged program synthesizing music/decay into temporal pockets feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, transforming haunted house trope through cello's code-playing climax.</comment>
