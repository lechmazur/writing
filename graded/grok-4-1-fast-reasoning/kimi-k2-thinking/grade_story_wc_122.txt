<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat numbness intensifies through embodied vibrations on skin during backward song, earning her final drum tap; drum maker applies targeted pressure via needle and explanation. Minor abstraction in "seeking something she could not name" at inciting moment softens early drive without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory hush density builds from needle acceptance to drum resonance, yielding RR closure ("heart... resonant chamber alive") with felt cost of thawed numbness in tears. Orientation anchored early in climb to cavern; one tightening via enthralling pulse suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cavern's damp walls, phonograph horn, and drum constrain pivotal choices (needle placement, groove carving), charging final image. Tactile vibrations mirror internal thaw selectively through deaf POV; purposeful autumn rustle recurs without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, tightens via protagonist agency in backward playback and drum tap under accumulative lens, foreclosing silent isolation with tearful cost legible at climax. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-song emerges organically from hush vibrations and drum, reweighted in final image ("feeling... in the quiet") without moralizing. Returning rustle motif shifts from barrier to bridge, tying arc to conceptual cost of prior winter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with deaf perceptual signature (skin senses over ears); lyrical rhythm modulates from longing to resonance without drift. Signed plea and drum maker's explanation carry subtext efficiently; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in vibration images propels to closure, with patterned "hush"/"rustle" recurrence serving textural lens; read-aloud rhythm varies. Minor overwrite in climax ("fissures spreading like ice on a warming lake") risks muddle but doesn't obscure drum tap payoff.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reverse phonograph for "filament of hush" transforms deafness trope into fresh synthesis of silence and vibration, inevitable in hindsight via cavern logic. Risky lyric hush accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
