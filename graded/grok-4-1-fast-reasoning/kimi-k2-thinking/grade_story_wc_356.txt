<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's ambition drives concrete micro-choices like grinding the seed and sharing the tincture, with embodied emotion in scent perceptions; internal conflict emerges in embracing decay's wisdom. Minor epiphanic summary in "He realized that cultivating serenity within motion meant embracing both the foul and the fragrant" feels slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rituals (seed prep, doodling, journaling) builds to CR closure in final image of seed "rested in the soil of his heart, a reminder that every ending is a beginning scented with possibility," with conceptual cost of decay feeding growth legible on page. Orientation anchored early in treetop village; one tightening via minstrel success deepens to village sharing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective olfactory details (night-blooming jasmine vs. sulfur, seed's "storm of decay and promise") filter through Elias's bias and constrain choices like dew collection from canopy; treetops and mossy bridges charge final serenity image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity in motion) signaled early, texturally escalates via seed-to-tincture success on frantic minstrel ("breathing slowed, footsteps light") narrowing to village sharing; cost felt in embracing foul fragrance, charging closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness amid motion emerges organically from seed's foul promise and village flourishing; final journal entry and heart-soil image offer non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting decay as growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with olfactory perceptual signature ("olfactorily sensitive nose"); rhythmic prose modulates poetically under ritual pressure, dialogue minimal but natural ("thanked Elias and left a gift").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with sensory propulsion, varied rhythm; purposeful repetition of motifs like doodling and "wildflower hush" taught early without loops dulling closure, though minor paraphrase in wisdom echoes ("undercurrent of wisdom") slightly drags peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, corpse seed rituals, and treetop mysticism transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking in poetic elision heightens thematic charge without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via scent-wisdom arc.</comment>
