<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as crisis actor/survivor roots actions in scarred hands and rehearsed tragedy, compelling the pattern walk with embodied commitment. Interiority concrete via shadow as question mark and historian self-view, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final endurance as keeper earned by prior steps, with visible cost in staying amid shifting shadows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern walk builds density to panel groan/opening (DC), retracing seals RR/Charged Poise with cost in carved pawns from wreckage. Orientation anchored early in gallery/chessboard. Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains choice via echoing floor pattern; marble heel-clicks, light/shadow interplay charge steps. Chessboard recurs, mirroring internal states and reweighting closure. Sensory hierarchy (auditory sighs dominant) reflects Kael's gesture-focus; luminous absence evolves with groan/light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind via pattern) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through letter-steps to groan/climax. Agency in deliberate strides forecloses silence with cost (scars, carved pawns). Prisoner emergence forces retrace, crystallizing stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures restoring pawns emerges via walking archive, charged by final vow-echo. Resonant non-literal close in chessboard remnant, but "This is how we unbind the past" and leader quote verge on echo (-0.4). Complexity lingers in ruthless kindness without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in gesture/light noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate strides to sighs. Voice texture distinct (poetic compression taught early), no head-hopping. Quote indirection carries subtext without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but ending paraphrase loops ("footsteps still spelled words... echo of a footstep spelling 'remember'") and "small gestures"/"luminous absence" churn dull closure (-0.8). Rhythm varies, but template cadence in step descriptions (e.g., 'r'/'e'/'m'). Zero grammar issues; propulsion strong til end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking-words, penumbra, pawn-carving transforms memory trope organically. Risky lyric boldness heightens stakes via pattern constraint; hindsight inevitability in gallery archive. No derivative echoes; singular vision commits to luminous absence.</comment>
