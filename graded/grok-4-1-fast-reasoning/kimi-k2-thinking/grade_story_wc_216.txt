<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies convincingly from defect-driven borrowed time to textural understanding, with embodied shifts like her pulse as ink compelling higher-stakes embedding of messages. Interior contradiction emerges in simultaneous debt/gift impulses, resolved in the palm-reading realization. Minor abstract epiphany at "eternity itself" slightly dilutes peak embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from urn touch to message replies to shadowless meeting, delivering CR closure where borrowed time reconfigures as gift with conceptual cost in the ledger-free existence. Orientation anchors crisply in first paragraph (Elara, silo, post-Recalibration). One tightening via garage-sale paradox narrows to silo's timeless interior.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's emerald cladding and dust-mote coalescence constrain the shadowless meeting choice and charge the prism metaphor in closure. Sensory hierarchy fits Elara's timeless perception narrowing to urn pulse and ledger swim. POV bias filters Recalibration through her cataloging urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rediscover Harrison's message tightens texturally via cryptic reply forcing silo's paradoxical arrival, with agency in message embedding. Cost legibly forecloses linear time in the hum-pulse endurance. Coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from urn/incident to garage paradoxes to final palm-lifelines, reweighting borrowed debt as gift in non-literal CR without moralizing. Subtext in "shadows were solid" implies eternity's complexity. Final sorting image resonates as thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward time-textures (ink-pulse, sandpapered silk), with rhythmic compression in timeless states. Brief dialogue ("He knew...") carries subtext and advances revelation naturally. No head-hopping; voice modulates from catalog crisp to eternal hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "pulse didn't stop; rather... eternal hum," with varied rhythm in ledger-swim paragraph. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("corroded jewel," "ink in water") near inciting touch risks coherence but spares closure. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Recalibration's numeric surrealism, backward-traveling garage listings, and urn as time-key transforms tropes into inevitable texture-driven CR. Garage-sale method risks boldly, heightening stakes via paradox payoff. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully to timeless logic.</comment>
