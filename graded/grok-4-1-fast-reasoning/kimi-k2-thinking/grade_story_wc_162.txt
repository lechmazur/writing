<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in father's legacy drives micro-choices like tracing grain and counting steps; embodied emotions via "heart beating in time" reveal character under pressure. Final endurance of wandering with calm certainty feels earned. Minor slips in alternating declarative insights dilute contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from grain analysis to threshold crossings culminating in CR ("I realize the distances were not just steps but moments of reverence") with felt cost of reverence/patience. Orientation anchored early ("drifting prism terrace...after the butterfly effect"). Single continuous scene fits scope; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wooden table's grain functions as micro-setting constraining choices by revealing map, charging final image ("grain still whispers, reminding me of the map"). Sensory details (air shift like exhale, prism refractions) selective and POV-biased. Prism terrace subtly mirrors internal sacredness without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover threshold sacredness) signaled early, deepens texturally via pattern intuition and crossings narrowing to reverence realization under Accumulative lens. One tightening (logbook alignment with grain) forecloses arbitrary wandering. Cost legible in "patience demanded"; agency via measured steps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred distances emerges organically from particulars like step-counting and father's whispers, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Returning grain/logbook motifs charge closure image non-literally. Complexity lingers in endless wandering amid hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in surreal noticing ("air tastes of starlight and corn silk"); rhythmic poetic diction modulates from ache to calm. Purposeful compression legible under textural lens; no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., "necessary distances" x4, "fractured hush" x4, logbook "trembles" twice) and repetitive realization stems create template cadence across realizations, dulling propulsion (−1.5). Density high but scaffolded; rhythm varies but artifacts obscure peak closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of corn maze legacy with prism surrealism transforms threshold tropes via measured steps and grain-map ingenuity. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
