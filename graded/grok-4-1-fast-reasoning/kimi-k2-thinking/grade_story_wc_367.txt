<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Herald's motivation to harness prophecy for a new dawn is clear and intensifies via ship signal, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax; shadowed elation feels embodied yet archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with motif density building to conceptual repricing (CR) at dawn break, reweighting shadows with destiny's cost; orientation anchored early in lighthouse routine; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse and glass wick constrain steering choice and charge final image; sensory details (howling wind, roiling sea) filtered through Herald's prophetic bias integrate purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide ship via power) signaled early tightens accumulatively with signal reception to prophetic shout narrowing options; agency in wick adjustment and words forces stance crystallization with legible relief cost at safe harbor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of ancient shadows birthing new dawn emerges organically from motifs and events, resonant non-literal answer in gold dawn recharging print/digital contrast without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity in prophecy lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (shadows answering, laughter merging wind); poetic rhythm modulates intensity, diction biased toward mythic texture without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with motif recurrence propels accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops ("ancient shadows," "laughed/laughter") and repeated "shadowed elation" dull some propulsion; rhythm varies, no closure-obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of digital fog, print relics, and prophetic shadows transforms lighthouse trope; risk in accidentally prophetic mechanic heightens stakes organically toward inevitable dawn reconfiguration.</comment>
