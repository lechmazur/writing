<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in claustrophobia versus sky-yearning, with climbing choice earning final balance; interiority concrete via "walls...pressed against her as if they could breathe." Father's warning adds crucible pressure without dominating. Minor tell in epiphany phrasing doesn't touch closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as silence flavors densify to CR closure ("bunker...vessel for preserving the golden quiet"), with cost in enduring "stretched knot"; orientation anchored early in bunker sanctum. One tightening via inversion climb reweights stake. No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Doll and trellis constrain choices (doll drinks quiet, trellis enables harvest), charging final image; sensory innovation ("flavor like mint and distant thunder") filters through POV tasting bias. Bunker evolves causally with layered hush. Micro-setting via doll qualifies fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. silence collection) signaled early, escalates texturally via inversion deepening that reweights bunker hush with agency-driven climb; cost felt in "fear and exhilaration" and return fall. Coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tangible silence garden emerges organically from doll harvests and inversion, resonant in final "voice in silence" without moralizing; reweights prison-to-vessel via particulars. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in yearning cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via silence-tasting bias; diction/rhythm modulate with pressure (short climb sentences). Minimal dialogue natural ("warned her not to let the silence escape"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, density high with multi-job lines; purposeful "silence" recurrence textural, not loop. Minor −0.4 for repetitive "stretched/contracted" stems (e.g., muscle, knot, rhythm) creating template cadence in ascent beats, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence flavors, inversion trellis, sprouting doll transforms claustrophobia trope; risk in surreal physics heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via early pattern. No derivatives.</comment>
