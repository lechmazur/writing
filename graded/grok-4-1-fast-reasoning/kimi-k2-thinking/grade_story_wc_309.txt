<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when fingers find no sigils but pulsing question compels refusal; underachiever's numb magic and calloused hands earn quiet stasis with pension forfeiture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mist walk density builds to spire; earned stasis closure lands on-page with dimming light cost making before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound spire's frost balcony and dying-light cathedral constrain unstrapping absence and charge final warming keystone image against preserving cold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to retrieve vs preserve tightens at no-sigil discovery forcing refusal; dimming endurance forecloses return path with visible light-cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sacred inefficiency theme emerges organically from automation backdrop and refusal; final keystone warmth reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of persistent magic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature favors inefficiency (mist's "patience over power"); rhythmic modulation sustains lyric texture to closure rhythm-match.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "dissolving coherence into morning fog" propels without loops or muddle; varied syntax breathes with mist climb to clean final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist walking as underachiever's inefficient ascent synthesizes automation-vs-organic magic freshly; stasis risk heightens stakes via spire's terminal preservation.</comment>
