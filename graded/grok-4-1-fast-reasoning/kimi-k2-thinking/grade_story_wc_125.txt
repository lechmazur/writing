<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to discover time's texture roots consistent poetic traits and compels endurance of paradox; internal conflict in rope choices (climb vs weave) shows contradictory impulses. Minor slip in abstract embodiment like "passionate subtlety" feels label-ish rather than crisis-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via knots/layers to CR closure: decision to carry rope reconfigures time as "braided" weave, cost in "infinite choices ahead" legible in final image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls and starlight constrain choices (rope tugs against "silver threads"); grotto pulses tactilely, mirroring internal weave. Recurrent rope-as-tool charges final trailing image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, deepens via frayed ends as "open" to new knots under Textural lens; one tightening reweights paradox, cost felt in foreclosed paths like severing pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time as choice-weave emerges organically from rope/knots; final image ("every fray is a door") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting impossible choices with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual bias toward patterns/textures; syntax/rhythm modulate to charged poise at end ("whispered a line of verse"). No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("frayed coil"/"layers"/"ethically playful" recur 5+ times without density gain); metaphor density blurs high-pressure decision ("each twist a question" in most sentences). Template cadence in openings ("He [felt][wondered][imagined]") dulls propulsion through closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rope as time-map post-energy beings transforms choice trope; poet's weave risks bold lyric structure, heightening stakes in paradox without gimmick.</comment>
