<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses shine when the idealist screams the price is too much but the sister nods and touches the root, earning the closure choice with embodied cost. Keeper applies targeted pressure without stereotypes. Minor label-speak like "reckless idealist" slightly undercuts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from card/root glow to memories pouring out, culminating in CR closure where "the destiny is restored, but the vessel is changed" reconfigures with legible conceptual cost in the smoke-passing fingers and threadbare soul. Single scene oriented early; no issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Roots snaking between bones constrain kneeling and card placement, charging the final image where roots no longer whisper post-barter. Sensory hierarchy (pulse at ankle, glow in bark) reflects Elara's priorities; vivid, purposeful integration throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore sister's destiny) tightens accumulatively when memories flood out as price, narrowing to imperfect Charged Poise; agency in touching root forecloses path with on-page cost of dulled eyes and lost laughs. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect sacrifice emerges organically from barter's transformation—"patched but threadbare"—reweighting the premise without moralizing; final pulse-sharing image offers resonant non-literal answer to soul-patching question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (roots whisper prophecies); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Some bridges...must be broken"). Rhythmic control modulates from descent to closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but patterned repetition of "inlaying meaning everywhere" (x3) borders on loop without full payoff, slightly dulling mid-beat; no closure harm, metaphors cohere (waxen smear to golden script).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard with bartered memories transforms tarot trope into fresh, grounded synthesis; risk in imperfect CR payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes through root-memory integration.</comment>
