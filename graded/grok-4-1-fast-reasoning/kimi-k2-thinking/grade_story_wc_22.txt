<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in coachman's belief in renewal, shown through escalating rituals culminating in guided planting of final seeds. Interiority concrete via embodied actions like boots sinking and fingers digging moisture, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for deeper conflict. Micro-choices reveal values without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hearing concord to bird-guided planting, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where garden reclaims battlefield with felt cost of ongoing tending and shared memory. Orientation anchored early (coachman on coast road, jetty). One tightening via gull's map narrows options to hidden springs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV: cracked battlefield refuses seeds until bird-guided springs constrain planting choice, charging final image of sprouting shoots. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to tactiles like dust settling and faint moisture amid urgency. Jetty and battlefield evolve causally from barren to breathing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bird patterns and gull's spring map forcing tactical shift. Agency in chants/songs scatters seeds with visible cost in parched earth refusal, reweighting via nascent garden. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at sprouts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of living/dead harmony emerges organically from seed rituals and bird chorus, resonant in final tapestry image sharing breath without erasing past. Subtext in silences and whispers avoids moralizing; counter-reading lingers in stubborn refusal turned affirmation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: languages/birds shape noticing, as in "cadence of warblers" mapping life traces. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, texture purposeful in poetic compression like "tiny ships sailing to a forgotten shore." No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies without monotony, though minor synonym echoes (birds, tongues) purposeful in pattern. No loops obscure closure; figurative language coherent, peaks clean in "shoots pushing through the cracks."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-reef war healed via bird concord and dead tongues transforms renewal trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, garden's reclamation bold without gimmick.</comment>
