<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between busting myths and embracing belief culminates in earned shift to myth-maker; micro-choices like tracing shell grooves reveal values under pressure. Minor weakness in abstract epiphanies like "riddle was the reader" lacking fuller embodied crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through vibrations and realizations to CR closure: shell cracks, releasing compass, with conceptual cost of eternal ghost-humming legible in "He would be that ghost." Orientation anchored early; single scene holds lens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliff observatory constrains via sea-air triggering cello hums and wind singing responses; charges final image as dome shudders. Sensory details like fluttering charts and eroding cliff mirror internal reconfiguration purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) deepens accumulatively via reimagined conversations and shell-map discovery, narrowing to "what ends first—the story, or the need to tell it?" Protagonist agency in retelling forces stance crystallization with ghost-cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belief birthing myths emerges organically from cello resonances and shell echoes; final image of cracking shell offers non-literal answer reweighting endings as becomings, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in resonant, mythic noticing (e.g., "hum resolved into a chord that had never existed"); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with vivid, multi-job lines; purposeful repetition of "hum"/"resonate" taught as pattern. Minor paraphrase loops in realization stems ("realized... saw... understood") slightly dull peak without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via cello/shell resonances transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at shell-crack payoff.</comment>
