<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete memory shards (strawberries, laughter) and embodied conflict (drumming ribcage, bleeding hands compel transformation). Final dissolution earned by prior rebellion (disabled cuff) with body-cost foreclosure. Contradictory impulses—quiet rebellion vs. facility risk—act in peak drone scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming density builds harmony from noise, tightening to lagoon transformation (RR/Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with dissolution cost ("His body dissolved into sound") and new resonance image. Orientation anchored early (platform, garden); no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: quartz trees, copper vines constrain drumming choices, evolve with ripples mirroring internal merge. Black stone and lagoon charge final image, reflecting lost constellations. POV bias sharpens sound/vibration hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge dream) signaled early, escalates via agency (deliberate drumming patterns, excising memories) under Accumulative lens—density to interference harmony amid drone pressure. Hands bleeding and body dissolution as unmistakable on-page costs narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over ghostly preservation emerges organically from drumming/memory waves, reweighted in final two-heartbeat resonance without moralizing. Auroral sorrow images shift from sorrow to free system, charging closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via sonic bias (ripples as silver rings, dying chords). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences in drone alarm). No dialogue; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action, image, sound (e.g., "each tap sent ripples... collided with crystalline flora"). Varied rhythm propels to peak; no loops, minor figurative consistency (auroral sorrow) purposeful, not muddled in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic garden manifests entangled consciousness via drumming surgery transforms memory-trope into tactile rebellion. Risky lyric sci-fi commits to premise (facility logs as malfunction); final garden-heartbeats inevitable hindsight.</comment>
