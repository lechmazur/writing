<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through time pressure to compel code completion, with traits shown in precise chalk work; interiority concrete in decoding margins. Minor weakness: internal conflict mostly implied rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal drawing beat, reducing raw ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from chalk symbols to handoff; closure as Conceptual Repricing in "The chalk would fade, but the code would survive," reweighting analog rebellion with conceptual cost of ephemerality vs. endurance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn constrains code via "morning shadows against the curves of each glyph" and charges final image of holograms flickering as past is swallowed. Sensory details selective through Kael's priorities, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete code before mailing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "thirty minutes before the letter was mailed" and margin puzzle deepening; cost felt in time contraction forcing precision. Agency in juxtaposing drives escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of analog resistance emerges organically from chalk acts and digital Collective contrast; final image of retreating into shadows offers resonant answer to rebellion's fragility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tech-nostalgic diction ("holographic shopfronts dormant," "vinyl recording" voice); brief dialogue natural, subtextual in Mira's "meaning in the margins" echo. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate to poised closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but figurative language dense in every descriptive sentence (e.g., "fossil of commerce, its holographic shopfronts dormant") without mid-beat sparsity dulls pressure; "margins" motif paraphrases thrice without new pressure, looping conceptual redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sidewalk chalk codes as futuristic pseudonym craft transforms tropes; chalk stubs pocketed at end feels inevitable, risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
