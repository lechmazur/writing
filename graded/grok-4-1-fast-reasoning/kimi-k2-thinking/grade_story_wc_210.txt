<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in rejecting restoration for reimagining, shown through weaving memories into blueprints; weakness in interiority mostly declarative without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal reflective beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from mind-training to incantation releasing chorus; closure as CR in "the amber bottle shimmered... glow faded," reconfiguring nostalgia to future seed with conceptual cost of sealed past legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bottle and lanterns as micro-settings constrain placement/action and charge final image ("amber reflections... resurrected spirit"); sensory selection vivid and purposeful, filtering through Kael's alchemical priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transform memory signaled early, tightening via accumulative deepening from holding bottle-shape to weaving festivals into "blueprint of a future city"; agency in refusal costs resurrection option, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-catalyst emerges organically through particulars like sealed bottle and sketched districts; resonant CR in final bottle-as-monument answering revival question non-literally, though "greatest alchemy... imagination" edges toward stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature in alchemical noticing ("turning over memories like tide-worn shells"); rhythmic prose modulates reflective intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "memory/reimagine" across reflective beats dull density ("reimagine an entire civilization" echoed variably 4x); overwriting with figurative density in climax without payoff obscures propulsion, though rhythm varies naturally elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory-work transforming ghost town trope into civilization-seed via sealed bottle; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
