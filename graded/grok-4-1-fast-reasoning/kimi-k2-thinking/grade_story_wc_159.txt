<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve sounds is consistent and intensifies via the humming choice, earning her endurance at closure. Interiority concrete in trailing fingers and humming but leans abstract/poetic without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; embodied emotion surfaces in "heart...felt the crack" but lacks deeper flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via resonant images, holds to Charged Poise CR in final lines where Lyra's fracture mirrors the tube with felt loneliness cost ("preservation was a quiet, lonely act"). Orientation anchors Lyra/setting by para 1; single scene fits defaults with density tightening via glowing orchids to closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring cracked tube and glass orchids constrain humming action and charge final image as fragility metaphor. Sensory details (shimmering petals, whistling fracture, harmonic fragments) selective/POV-filtered, evolve causally with sound cascade; spatial choreography coherent in aisles/galleries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via resonance discovery to orchid glow unveiling emptiness, forcing endurance with legible cost (hollow halls, personal fracture). Agency in humming/continuing forecloses perfection path under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect preservation emerges organically from tube/orchid images shifting to personal mirror at "Lyra's heart, too, felt the crack." Resonant CR in final defiance image avoids moralizing; subtext in foxglove regret layers ambiguity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/sound biases ("petals that shimmered like frozen tears"); rhythmic poetic texture modulates from systematic to charged poise. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("wind chime bamboo tube cracked" verbatim x4, "gently systematic" x3, "museum of extinct feelings" x4) create synonym churn/redundancy, dulling density across beats including closure ("cracked bamboo tube continued to sing"). Template cadence in repetitive sentence stems erodes propulsion; overwrought figuration muddles in peak glow cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of museum of extinct feelings/orchids with echo-preservation transforms memory tropes into fragile ritual. Conceptual integrity in opal-clouds marvels risks bold lyricism, inevitable in hindsight via fracture motif charging closure without gimmick.</comment>
