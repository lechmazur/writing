<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via time pressure to record glyphs, with embodied emotion in "latent blaze ignite within her chest"; micro-choices like tracing glyphs reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure navigation beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal linkages hold: doodle reveal therefore grotto entry, inversion therefore alcove access, slipping hour therefore narrow escape leap "just as the last flicker faded" as Charged Poise closure with felt cost of potential trapping. Single-POV, two-shard structure (discovery to return) fits scope; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inversion revealing "hidden alcoves that normally lay beneath the floor" constrains navigation and charges escape; mist "clung to her skin," slick walls tactile via goal-directed action. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist's prism-minded bias toward luminous hidden details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of securing combinations tightens via causal escalation: "hour was slipping away... grotto began to shudder," forcing run and leap with agency-driven narrowing of options. Cost legible in "landing hard... tugging at her heels."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge/vigilance emerges via prism-doodle unlocking combinations, reweighted in final image of "prism beside [manuscript], a silent sentinel." Resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in refracted light/noticing hidden glyphs; voice texture consistent in poetic diction like "faint, clandestinely luminous." No dialogue; rhythmic modulation under stress via shorter escape sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive motif "latent blaze" (4x) and paraphrase loops in closing ("she would be ready... latent blaze... would come again") dull final third momentum and touch closure image. Strong rhythmic variety and density elsewhere; purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gravity inversion unlocking "serpentine grotto" during timed window transforms hidden-knowledge quest into fresh causal fantasy synthesis, risking altered physics payoff in escape without late rules.</comment>
