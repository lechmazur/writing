<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to locate zeroth volume intensifies through embodied actions like folding the scarf, earning the final reawakening with felt recursive cost. Interiority concrete via scarf's hum and topological folds revealing character limits. Young man's secondary pressure shares solitude effectively without headcount penalty. Minor abstractness in epiphany ("stories never truly end") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic imagery density builds from library opening to portal emergence ("threshold unfolded"), culminating in CR closure where zeroth volume pulses and stories refold patrons with conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (3:17 AM unlock, hyperbolic aisle). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity. Persistent scarf constraint shapes tactics to charged final Möbius strip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via non-Euclidean shelves inhaling to form portal, charging closure image of ceiling constellation. Sensory details selective (scarf warming, threads humming, frozen sound pedestal) mirror urgency and POV bias toward math-poetry fusion. Spatial choreography clear (aisle to threshold to chamber). Micro-setting (pages as black holes) evolves causally without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken zeroth volume) signaled early, tightens texturally via scarf-folding reversal narrowing to portal entry, forcing endurance of recursive cost legible in "stories they held now held them back." Agency in librarian's method culminates Charged Poise. One deepening sufficient; minor abstract stakes prevent 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursive stories emerges organically from particulars (event horizons, folding topologies), resonant CR in final scarf/Möbius reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in shared solitude and young man's equation enriches ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question; invites reflection via charged counter-reading of eternal cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature (equations rhyming, shelves curving like saddle) biased to librarian's eccentric lens. Voice rhythmic, modulating from descriptive to intensified in chamber flood. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("spoke the equation aloud" rhymes with breathing). No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful (scarf to Klein bottle warping air) without muddle in peak chamber beat. Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; read-aloud flows. Minor overwriting in hyperbolic aisle stacks figurative language but pattern-taught early, avoiding artifact cap. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math topology and narrative memory (scarf as spacetime map to zeroth volume) transforms tropes organically, risk-taking in non-Euclidean library heightens recursive stakes. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity commits to premise implications. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, earning hindsight ingenuity.</comment>
