<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Merrin's interiority concrete and particular, with embodied longing blooming at closure ("tasted of starlight and lost chances"); woman's thin traits limit relational crucible, but Merrin's flaw (frees others, not self) earns endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens from arrival to star-hinted climax, landing CR in final image (Merrin's own hair wrapped, cost of perpetual waiting felt); orientation anchored early in nexus/twilight, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus and Venus angle constrain climax timing and pattern, charging final image; selective starlight sensory evolution mirrors internal unfurling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped idea) signaled early, escalates via star-wait density to disorienting turn narrowing options; agency in weaving/mantra forecloses fear's hold with Merrin's felt cost of self-denial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imprisoned truths emerges organically via hair-unbraiding and Merrin's reflection, resonant CR reweighting her role without moralizing; final image ("wrapped one stray hair—her own") answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with biased cosmic perceptual signature ("universe was a lock"); woman's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances goal without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dense metaphors overload climax ("unbraiding fear from follicle, untangling memory from melanin"), creating coherence drag without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops ("cosmic possibility," "hush") dull propulsion, but rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith freeing metaphysical ideas via stellar hints transforms trope organically; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
