<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation singular and intensifying through ritual choices like polishing the boy's rose quartz dream; embodied grief in bleeding fingers and scarred hands reveals contradiction between torment and peace; final placement of breath in diamond lantern earns reconfiguration without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from first crane to thousandth, culminating in CR at "shadow stepped from beneath... final lantern that would never fold but always shine," cost legible as "keeper and prisoner" with island's eternal capture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass basilica's spiral stair paradox constrains polishing/descent actions; tea garden's midnight folds and wind interact with cranes tactilely; final leaves-to-glass evolution charges closure image, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim daughter's breath signaled early, escalates accumulatively via islanders' offerings and shadow's stir after boy's crane; agency in persistent folding despite non-flying birds; cost in scarred hands and sleeplessness visible, foreclosing normalcy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-light transformation emerges organically from particulars like weeping quartz and singing cranes; final CR reweights shadow's departure as "gift," resonant without moralizing, counter-reading in "luminous torment" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in grief-faceted diction like "polish it until it becomes sharper than absence yet thin enough to fly"; rhythmic modulation builds to humming basilica hum; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with motifs like descending/ascending patterned and purposeful; minor paraphrase loops in repeated crane transformations (e.g., "each one a...") slightly dull mid-section propulsion without harming closure; rhythm varies read-aloud effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-gems, shadow-grief, paradox stairs transforms loss tropes; origami cranes as grief-ladders feel inevitable in hindsight; bold lyric risk-taking heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
