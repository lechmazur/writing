<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to plant second thoughts roots consistent traits and drives choices like displays and grotto, with micro-choice in whispering to child revealing values hierarchy. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete but leans abstract without peak degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via prophecy-images building to CR closure: mist's scent of change reweights rebellion premise with conceptual cost of inward-turning minds. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; legible shards with one tightening in decision-to-act beat narrow options non-violently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt mist and grotto constrain gathering and charge final image, mirroring internal quiet shift; sensory hierarchy (heavy mist, soft clicks, starlight) selective via coach's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography clear across shards; no white-room, evolves causally to echo change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of humble rebellion vs. complacency signaled early, escalates accumulatively via displays interrupting routines to puzzle in square forcing second thoughts. Agency in organizing forecloses violent path with felt cost of authorities' puzzled watchfulness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolutions emerges organically from chess puzzles as forests of second thoughts, resonant non-literal answer in mist-scent reweighting prior patterns without moralizing. Complexity embraced in non-violent success amid lingering hush; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of hearing unspoken, modulating rhythm to amplify quiet (short clicks amid hush). Voice lyrical-consistent, diction purposeful; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with purposeful hush-repetition building texture, high density in image integration; minor paraphrase loops on "unspoken" and "second thoughts" across non-peak beats dull slightly without touching closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as non-violent rebellion transforms revolution trope via puzzles/windows/grotto; bold quiet risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight in prophecy-to-change arc without hedging.</comment>
