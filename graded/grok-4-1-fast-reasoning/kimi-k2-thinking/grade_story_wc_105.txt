<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through synesthetic perception of absences as violet whine; motivation rooted in betrayal wound compels micro-choices like vial collection, culminating in earned realization that forecloses vengeful clarity with conceptual cost of permanent absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density via absence collection to forge reignition as tightening cadence shift; CR closure lands on-page in "the quiet that comes after, pure and terrible and complete," reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost of transmission ceased.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse with black water pressure and shipwrecks constrains Lyra's pruned-hand work and nutrient bath assembly; final line's shipwrecks "leaning closer, listening" charges closure image, mirroring internal silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to isolate trust's breaking frequency escalates texturally through absence archive to forge's memory compression; agency in amplification forces stance crystallization with cost in device drop and "pristine absence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory's impact as negative space emerges organically via grafts and vials; final image of "cleared channel" reconfigures trust not as fracture but cessation, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("algae's green glow into distant chimes"); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure's charged poise, diction biased toward sonic voids.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands, perpetually pruned... assembled devices"); purposeful metaphor accumulation serves textural lens without muddle or loops dulling forge reignition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes synesthesia, memory imprints, and betrayal as absence in irreplaceable sunken orchard; bold risk in lyric CR of trust's "hollow note" feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
