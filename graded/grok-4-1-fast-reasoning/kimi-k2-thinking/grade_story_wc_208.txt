<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to scaffold complexity with simplicity drives concrete micro-choices like carving the curved line token, earning her reconfiguration as alliance keeper with felt cost of perpetual listening over isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and pattern recognition build to Conceptual Repricing closure at token placement and slide's final image, reweighting individual obsession with lineage cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Barnacled rocks, moving wave carvings, and turbine-hum constrain her climb and charge the carving/placement beat; recurring hum evolves to ancestral chorus, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining the archway tightens via slide projection deepening knowledge of alliances, forcing endurance under impending storm; cost legible in stayed presence and foreclosed departure, though pressure leans conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited perpetual learning emerges organically from layered slide etchings and simple carving holding shore complexity; final slide image with figures in mist offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sculptor's perceptual bias (wood/sea as languages) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from meditative hum to crescendo, heightening realizations without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied syntax, though minor simile stacks in opening (turbine-hum reverie, meditation bell) border overwriting without obscuring closure carving beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of modern turbines with ancient slide magic transforms legacy-quest trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off via turbine blade carving echoing ancestral spiral, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
