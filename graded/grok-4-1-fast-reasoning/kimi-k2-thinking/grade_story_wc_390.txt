<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "logically, it could be undone; emotionally, she wept," driving the hummed choice with embodied tears freezing on cheeks. Final heart tuned to 7.8 hertz earns change with cost. Minor diagnostic label-speak like "logically emotional creature" slightly undercuts immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of sonic patterns to RR closure: creature dissolves into stars with emotional cost legible in whispered gratitude and her changed rhythm. Orientation anchored early in marina. No lens ambiguity; persistent ice/sound constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice constrains via locked boats and singing bridge, charging final "singing ice toward the lighthouse." Azure coat and key as micro-setting tactilely evolve with salt/sound. Sensory hierarchy (taste vibration, frozen tears) reflects engineer's bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to escape/protect flute tightens via shadow's demand and her vibrational agency, foreclosing skiff option with ice fist. Escalation deepens density to chord climax under accumulative lens. Cost felt in creature's relief and her duality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flesh/frequency duality emerges organically from sonic release of grief, reweighted in final "duality defined her" without moralizing. Whalebone flute shifts from thrum to lullaby payoff. Counter-reading in endless hunger adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: emotions as frequencies, sound tasted as "copper and salt." Rhythmic modulation peaks in "chord of sonic absolution." No elision issues; prose texture reflects engineer's wave-blurred mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density (molten coin, spilled ink, crystalline fist) borders overwriting in climax without harm to closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in sequential strikes. Ear-test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sonic absolution transforms grief-parasite trope via frequency science, inevitable in hindsight from early 7.8 hertz setup. Bold fleshly ethereal synthesis heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; fresh key-as-tuning-fork risks pay off.</comment>
