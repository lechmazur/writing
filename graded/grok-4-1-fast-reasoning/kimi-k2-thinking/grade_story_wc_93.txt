<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation from mentor's promise compels rock placement despite precognitive cost shown in "each future glimpse a shard of glass"; internal conflict embodied in trembling hands at final rock, earning realization and renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to eel surge and dust flare; CR closure in "she let the star dust's glow fade" reconfigures patterns as witnessed, not solved, with legible cost in lingering promise and partial world traces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff and aurora constrain edge-standing and rock sequence; eels surging from surf and frictionless sea ground actions, charging final image of grooves in sand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore friction via patterns tightens through intensifying visions and eel vectors narrowing to choice; agency in final rock and fade forecloses full restoration with felt cost of transient power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing over solving emerges organically from interplay of dust, eels, and aurora; final image of "small grooves in the sand" offers resonant CR repricing promise as endless sequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("Fibonacci spirals of seashells"); lyrical diction modulates to charged poise in ending without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration in climax ("star dust flared, a silver thread"); figurative density purposeful but borders overwrit in peak visions, slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless world, math-eel patterns, and star dust transforms mythic tropes; risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in realization without gimmickry.</comment>
