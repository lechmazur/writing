<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas's persistence is embodied through daily returns to bolts and seats, rooting motivation in silence-as-possibility; singing breaks years of muteness with earned cost. Lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices under solitude reveal values hierarchy. Flawless trait integration elevates without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to Resonant Reconfiguration: halo fitted, carousel spins with train's exhale as conceptual cost of restored motion from stasis. Orientation anchored early ("abandoned circus train," "three seasons"); wrong turn tightens to discovery without ambiguity. Closure image ("mist...dissolved into...glowing light") reconfigures silence with undeniable price paid in persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "rust-eaten corridor" maze and "warped door," charging final image where cracks fill with light; sensory hierarchy (gleam, creak, hush) filters through Silas's perceptual bias. Oasis spring pulses with halo, mirroring internal rhythm. Recurrent train cars evolve from tomb to sanctuary without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore halo/carousel) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via wrong turn deepening knowledge/options; agency in persistence/singing forecloses silence path with felt cost (throat opened after years). No reversal overload; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in spinning horses. Minor abstractness in stakes viscerality holds back peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (silence as seed blooming possibility) emerges organically from persistence-discovery-song arc; final image ("silence now a song") reconfigures premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity. Subtext in hush-to-breath shift avoids morals; irony in "wrong turn" path to hope enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing gleams/hushes in carpenter's idiom); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to resonant pulse without drift. Lyrical compression taught early ("hands told stories") pays off legible at closure. No head-hopping; voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short pulses in song beat); density high, each line layering image/pressure without major loops. Purposeful recurrences ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") taught early as pattern, charging closure; minor synonym churn in ending silences dings propulsion slightly. No artifacts dulling peak ("halo fragment pulsed").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carpenter myth in rust-maze lyricism transforms restoration trope; "wrong turn" to oasis/ song reweights silence uniquely from particulars. Bold poetic risk heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, fully committed vision.</comment>
