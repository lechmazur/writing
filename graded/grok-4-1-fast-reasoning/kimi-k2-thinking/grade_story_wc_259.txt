<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal loss intensifies compellingly to purification choice; embodied contradictory anguish/joy in "heart pounding, she felt anguished joy" acts simultaneously. Final endurance of bittersweet burden earned by prior struggle. Minor vagueness in loss backstory dilutes specificity without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of memories and purification builds to CR closure; withdrawal from pagoda with "bittersweet burden she would carry forever" lands legible cost. Orientation anchored early in archive; one tightening via memory flood narrows to unpredictable method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pagoda facets constrain purification choice and charge spinning kaleidoscope final image. Sensory details like humming sigils and dust motes integrate purposefully, mirroring internal drift. No white-room; tactile bronze touch evolves with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to purify nostalgia without sorrow tightens accumulatively via flood of tainted memories forcing unpredictable drift; agency in irregular breathing forecloses patterned trance path. Cost legible in relived losses charging pagoda spin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of corrupted nostalgia as double-edged emerges organically via purification turning melancholy blue to amber; final "fragile line" image reweights end-of-innocence premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward sigils/memories; distinct poetic texture modulates with intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "steadily unpredictable" and "anguished joy" loops across beats dull propulsion (−0.8); paraphrase churn in end-of-innocence references borders template cadence. Density high overall, rhythm varies, but artifacts touch reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia and pattern-avoidance synthesize fresh forbidden-knowledge frame; pagoda spin turn inevitable from taught world logic. Bold lyric risk heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
