<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Quietly savvy trait shown in decoding flowers and riddle, with embodied heartbeats syncing station; realization of theft as translation earns arc with chase's cost. Weakness: "luminous disbelief" stock phrasing recurs without deepening contradiction, flattening peak emotion in portrait reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/decoding builds to Charged Poise closure as portal breathes and train departs, cost in eternal chase legible ("weight...pressing against her heart"). Orientation anchors early (station, Lux, sunset); one tightening via moon-riddle reweights options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald tiles pulse with heartbeat, moonlight/jar constrain choices (pour light into keyhole); bench compartment and clock chimes ground spatial choreography. Sensory light hierarchy mirrors urgency, charging final mosaic reflection without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access destiny via portrait) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through floral code to moon-riddle reversal narrowing options; agency in reinterpret/pour forecloses stasis with chase cost felt in boarding whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of light-translation emerges organically from jar/painting shifts, reweighting theft to map without statement; final train image answers "destiny's door" via luminous pursuit, lingering ambiguity of endless chase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in light-diction/rhythm ("shadow stitched with light"), perceptual bias to illuminations consistent; stable single-POV, no leakage, modulates to hushed closure whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting via stacked metaphors ("silver thread weaving...painted night") and "illuminated moments"/"luminous disbelief" loops dull peak density around canvas reveal; paraphrase churn (multiple "smiled"/"pressed ear") drags propulsion, though rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of portrait-map/celestial code transforms thief trope; moonbeams jar as tactile relic risks bold lyricism, inevitable in hindsight via light-accumulations charging chase premise.</comment>
