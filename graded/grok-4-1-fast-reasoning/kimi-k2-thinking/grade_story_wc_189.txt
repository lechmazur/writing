<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in fingers tracing water and cicada grooves under pressure of pause; warmly observant trait reveals via micro-choice of tangential gaze over direct confrontation. Brother's presence adds relational crucible but remains underdeveloped. Minor diagnostic tone in realizations ("essence of transition periods") slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from reflective observations to CR closure in tide rising and brother's acceptance, reweighting transitions with felt cost of letting go. Orientation anchored early in grotto/pool. Single scene tightens meaningfully via pause to shared understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (starlight pooling like silver, water's soft give) filters through chronicler's bias, constraining choices via ripples revealing truths. Grotto stone and tide charge final image, mirroring internal shifts. Micro-setting (cicada, pool) indispensable to realizations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating brother's departure) signaled early, escalates texturally via observation density to deepening acceptance; tangential gaze forecloses confrontation path with relational cost. Agency in endurance/renunciation legible. Subtle but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from particulars (cicada veins, ripple clocks, tide surge), culminating in resonant CR: "transition was not a disruption but a continuous flow" reweights premise without moralizing. Counter-readings in brother's stubbornness add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tangential drifts, textural notices) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from hush to gentle surge. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven in breaking silence. Diction fits chronicler's observant idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("texture of time," "warmly observant," cicada pulses) creates paraphrase loops across reflective beats, dulling propulsion (-0.8); figurative density overwrites high-pressure pause without pattern payoff. Strong rhythmic variety elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler observing sibling rite via cicada/grotto transforms farewell trope; risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens stakes. Non-obvious angle on time's grooves inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
