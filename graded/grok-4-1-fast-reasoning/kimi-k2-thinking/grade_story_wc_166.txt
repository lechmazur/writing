<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via choice of exile, but diagnostic phrasing like "Her motivation burned clear: to pen a cosmic verse" over-articulates without embodied contradiction, flattening interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from anchoring ("spontaneous anchor rooted her") to tattoo release; Charged Poise closure legible in "stood, a new creature... stepped beyond" with exile cost felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garden constrains harvest/tattoo choices and charges final skin-map image; sensory details (dew-laden petal, salt taste) selective and POV-biased toward tides/voids.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy ban via memory inscription) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through tattoo deepening that narrows freedom with on-page cost of surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of indelible memory emerges organically from tattoo/dance images, but "Her story became a testament" borders explicit echo, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with distinct tidal/perceptual signature; rhythmic lyricism modulates effectively, though minor repetition erodes peak propulsion (capped per Q7 debt).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in finale ("dance continued... perpetual fledging"; "whispered secrets" reprise) and repetitive epiphanies ("She realized... She had learned") dull closure cadence and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia ban with moonstone tattoo transforms trope; bold lyric fantasy risks pay off in cosmic skin-map premise without gimmick.</comment>
