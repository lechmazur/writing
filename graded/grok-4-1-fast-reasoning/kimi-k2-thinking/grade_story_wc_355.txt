<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to catalog silences drives consistent micro-choices like tuning the radio, with embodied emotion in her steady hands and racing heart. Internal conflict subtle but present in imagining lock pins as silences amid anticipation. Pacifism and eclecticism feel particular through tools but underutilized in pressure; change to empathy feels earned yet lacks deeper contradiction before diary opens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds from tools to radio voice to clasp opening, culminating in CR closure via diary quote and shared listening with neighbor—cost legible in unlocked clasp as symbol of opened empathy. Single scene anchored early (workshop, Mira, stars). No orientation debt; one tightening via resonant frequency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop under stars vividly anchors with sensory selectivity (hiss, crackle, starlight thin as voice), constraining choices via tools/radio proximity. Fireworks hush pressures timing; radio/diary as micro-settings evolve tactilely (pulsing clasp, falling pages), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Workshop door creak integrates neighbor naturally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open diary via silences for memory/empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tuning deepening (voice caught, clasp pulses/resonates) to CR reconfiguration. Agency in persistent dialing narrows options; cost felt in emotional opening ("true explosion...within her"). One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via silences emerges organically from tuning/lock beats, resonating in final image of shared night-listening reweighting premise without moralizing. Father's quote integrates as earned pivot; ambiguity lingers in "path...never ceased." Minor overtness ("path to empathy") borders echo but events ground it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: silences as "metallic, cold, waiting" bias noticing. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically (short anticipatory sentences to expansive realizations), consistent diction fits intuitive cataloger. No dialogue to judge; elisions (memory) anchor to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("shadowed workshop under stars," "final stillness before fireworks ignite") creates paraphrase loops across opening/closing, dulling propulsion; dense figuratives (silences as breath/bell/kiss) risk overwrite in tuning beat without full pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but template echoes ("She...") in realizations drag momentum. Clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tuning radio frequencies to "hear" lock's silence transforms pacifist silence-catalog into metaphysical lockpick, risking theatricality but cohering in empathy CR. Motifs (fireworks silences) evolve organically; no derivatives, bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
