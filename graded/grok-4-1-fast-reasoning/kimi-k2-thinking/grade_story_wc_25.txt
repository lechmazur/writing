<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marek's traits like walk identification and map mastery drive choices with embodied precision, earning the final proof; minor tell-heavy interiority on "calculated spontaneity" slightly dilutes contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through bet-to-whisper-to-alarm chain with on-page CR closure ("smuggler's smooth walk turned to a panicked stumble"); cost legible in capture and corridor loss, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth as resonating chamber constrains sound tactics and charges final hum; selective sensory focus on vibrations and gaits via storm filters through Marek's priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whisper pre-storm end) tightens via sprint and frequency strike, narrowing options with agency; cost felt in smuggler's foiled escape alters trajectory under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of precision whispers emerges organically via sound pathways and final coin image reweighting chaos/order without moralizing; resonant counter-reading in "ghost walks" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward acoustics and gaits; voice modulates rhythmically in storm beats, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("You heard a whisper?") advances goal naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action with sensory propulsion; minor metaphor density ("oil over glass") in opener risks overwrite but patterns without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acoustic labyrinth + tuning-fork key transforms port thriller into sound-science ingenuity; zodiac folds and walk signatures synthesize fresh without gimmick, risking poetic compression payoff in CR.</comment>
