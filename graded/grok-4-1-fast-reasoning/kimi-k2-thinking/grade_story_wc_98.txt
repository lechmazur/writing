<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical measurement and belief act in scene (spectrograph vs. singing "calibrated to the frequency of doubt"), earning final endurance of luminous doubt with visible cost in ongoing uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations/dreams builds to on-page Charged Poise closure ("ridge wakened... luminous doubt remained") with conceptual cost in petal's "humming a question mark"; orientation anchored early (ridge blooming, Kael's job).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge's "stone veins holding stories" and looming monsoon constrain planting/singing choices; final "petal now rested, gold and warm" charges image, with POV-filtered details like "binary" flowers and "17 percent" drop reflecting empirical whimsy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve memory before monsoon) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through dreams clarifying action and unprecedented singing narrowing to belief; cost legible in reconfigured doubt charging final petal image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory/dream tension emerges organically via ridge's memory-light visions; final "reality... between what could be proven and what must be believed" offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (quantifying wonder: "flowers... solving for x, where x equaled belief"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via integrated metaphors ("each photon a story") propel climax without loops or muddle; minor density of figures in peak ("memory-light") coheres but borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical magic-checking and ridge-as-memory-keeper transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via "sang to the stone," inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
