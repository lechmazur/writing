<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between reticence and urge to testify peak in the devastating "nothing" response to his name, earning the final aloud reading with visible cost of prior erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as layered discoveries tighten to CR closure; cost legible in "his reticence had been not a virtue but an erasure," reweighting premise without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn constrains via fading light and chained doors, charging final image of dust motes dancing like "forgotten letters"; body/palm holds crystal as micro-setting alternative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding growth deepens via crystal's erosion pattern and personal silence void, forcing agency in desperate reading; cost unmistakable in foreclosed presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of leaving crystal under chandelier non-literally answers growth-as-erosion, reweighting "spaces between" words with conceptual cost of untestified life; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (sonic hush, lexical decay) modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression in fractured voices taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor elevated diction fits scholarly voice without muddle, though faint metaphor density in pattern emergence slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic crystal fossil transforms library trope into fresh premise of word-erosion; risk of lyric accumulative structure inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via personal erasure.</comment>
