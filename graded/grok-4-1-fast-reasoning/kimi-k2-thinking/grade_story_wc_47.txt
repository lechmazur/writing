<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via pendant's weight mirroring truth's burden; micro-choices like arranging moss reveal values under pressure. Final endurance of opening sanctuary earned by prior reclamation acts. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("quietly proactive") slightly abstracts peak reflection but does not flatten contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of moss patterns and observations builds to Charged Poise closure in "she would proffer this place to others," reconfiguring confession's cost into purpose. Orientation anchored early ("Three weeks after her confession"); one tightening via spiral memorial to communal vision. Cost legible in lost career felt through garden's "patient architecture."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (honey taste, dripping condensation, bee buzz) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining choices like proffering cooling-system water. Data center ruins as micro-setting charge final image, mirroring internal resilience. No orientation debt; details evolve with her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming post-confession wounds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening patterns to stance crystallization; agency in deliberate moss acts forecloses isolation with felt reputational cost. One tightening sufficient: personal meditation to sanctuary decision. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilient transformation emerges organically from moss-over-keyboards and amber preservation, reweighting betrayal into promise without statement. Final bee navigation offers resonant non-literal answer to vulnerability's protection. Recurring garden images shift meaning at end, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture in perceptual signature (e.g., "ferns unfurled like green memories"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity without drift. Stable third-limited POV with character-biased noticing; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent and purposeful (e.g., "icicle drips" pattern integrated into action). Minor density in figurative clusters ("honeyed hush") risks slight overwrite but supports textural lens without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whistleblower ruin-as-garden reclamation transforms tropes via specific moss/icicle mechanics and bee navigation finale. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
