<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Repairman's curse-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied rust pain during doubt-fueled false note, compelling honest litany micro-choice that earns healing closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as honesty-density builds from polishing to tethering, with false note reversal tightening stakes; RR closure via chip flare defeating rust with time-cost legible in eleven chimes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's quartz pedestal and silver veins constrain amplification choice, charging final melody image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, rust bloom) filters through tinker's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore melody before midnight) deepens via rust temptation and false note, forcing agency in tethering; visible pain cost alters tactics into final wind-up.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Honesty-vs-rust theme emerges implicitly from litany triumph over temptation, reweighting covenant in non-literal dawn petals and endless tune without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with mechanical-perceptual signature ("gears sang notes of pure truth") remains stable under pressure; minimal dialogue absent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels climax; consistent rust metaphors avoid muddle, though occasional heavy figuration in pressure slightly dulls propulsion—"music poured forth... gear clicking into eternity" redeems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" paradox transforms alchemical tropes into fresh tinkersong synthesis, with rust covenant risks heightening stakes organically to inevitable dawn.</comment>
