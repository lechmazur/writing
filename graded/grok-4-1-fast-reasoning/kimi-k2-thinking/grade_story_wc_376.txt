<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the guard encounter where half-truths curl her leaves amid sincere purpose; final renunciation of past lies earned via buried tape revelation with embodied cost. Character-specific traits like gold-stained hands and wilting drive all micro-choices without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries densify from map to personal reel; on-page CR closure in "hearing it, she understood" reconfigures premise with raw emotional cost legible in buried truth moment. Orientation anchored early in studio; one tightening via fragment suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring toxic sky contrasts internal oasis, constraining path (sour air, glass corridors) and charging final image where "inside, a quiet oasis thrived." Sensory details like "hissed" tape and rusted ladder filter through calligrapher's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively to personal reel, narrowing via guard pressure where wilting forces sincere trade-off; agency in descent and listening forecloses denial with "raw" cost felt on-page. Escalation coheres under lens without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of candor preservation emerges organically via wilting/reel images shifting to "candor bloomed"; final scroll-sharing offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior wilts without moralizing. Complexity in past self-deception lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in leaf/gold motifs; rhythmic diction modulates from hollow city to shimmering renewal without head-hopping. Brief guard dialogue natural, subtext-driven by evasion vs sincerity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (e.g., "whisper of paper" into descent); no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion, varied syntax breathes with scene. Minor leaf repetitions motif-taught, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wilting trait, tape archive, and gold transcription transforms post-apoc tropes into inevitable candor oasis; risk in surreal biology (zinc pulse) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
