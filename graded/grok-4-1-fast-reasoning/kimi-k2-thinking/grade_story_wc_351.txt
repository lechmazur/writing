<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong helix-minded interiority and motivation to excavate dreams, embodied in spiraling perceptions and micro-choices like raising the mirror; earned self-modification as change with felt entanglement cost. Internal conflict leans declarative ("This was the risk... But she accepted") rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, missing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from mirror raise to canyon plasticity; crisp CR closure in "all mirrors are broken, all memories entangled, all canyons are ultimately mind," with legible entanglement cost reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phosphorescent canyon walls as neurological substrate constrain memory work and charge final exhaling image; selective sensory glow, tremble mirror internal states purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dream excavation tightens accumulatively as reverie deepens indistinguishability of self/memories, forcing self-modification trade-off; agency in mirror adjustments drives escalation with ripple costs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of entangled mind/canyon emerges organically via rewoven threads and final image repricing "excavate the past is to modify the present's synaptic foundation"; resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with helix-minded perceptual signature (spiraling currents, multiple angles); rhythmic poetic diction modulates intensity, pattern-taught lyric compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful motif repeats ("synaptic plasticity") build texture without loops obscuring cause/effect. Minor conceptual redundancy in transformation phrasing nudges below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of geological neural plasticity and dream archaeology feels inevitable and bold; mirror-canyon entanglement transforms tropes with zero retreat from premise.</comment>
