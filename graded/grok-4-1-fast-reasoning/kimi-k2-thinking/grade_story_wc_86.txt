<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thoughtful traits shown via tactile drawer pull and gestures like bowing, compelling ritual choices; relief/doubt contradiction embodied in lingering watch of prisoners. Minor epiphanic summary in final whisper softens peak pressure without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to moon-crested exchange as Charged Poise RR, fragile trust reconfigured with doubt-cost in "heart a mixture of relief and lingering doubt." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via causeway reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-slick stone and moon constrain timing/footing, charging final mist-thickened dawn image; sensory hierarchy (wind breath, rope hiss, chain clink) filters via Kael's priorities. Parapet as micro-setting guides every choice without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ritual stake signaled early tightens via moon synchronization, narrowing to misstep-war risk; mist-lift glimpse forces stance crystallization under textural lens. Low explicit opposition fits but limits visceral cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Apology-forgiveness theme emerges via hinge-pull and rope motifs shifting to "recycle bitter past," resonating in dawn silhouette without moralizing; final raven cry reweights fragile trust implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual bias in mist/history filters; rhythmic diction modulates from tense hush to charged release. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in Lin's reassurance whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short knot-loosening sentences propel); density high, metaphors coherent (moon scythe, hinge door). Minor hush/mist repetition purposeful for tone, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ritual prisoner exchange transformed via moon-tide sync and drawer-pull symbol into fresh fragile-trust meditation; risk in poetic compression heightens atmospheric stakes organically.</comment>
