<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength in embodied emotions and micro-choices like tracing the swatch card, revealing fractured identity under pressure; final acceptance earned through dual-lineage echo. Minor diagnostic labels like "unkindled solace" slightly abstract interiority but don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors Mira/ship/quest by paragraph 1; progression via card-seam-door-garden builds density to CR closure where realization reweights premise with acceptance cost ("chose to stay"). One tightening at twin blossom suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via tilting deck and mural-seam; sensory details (popcorn/mildew, flapping canvas) selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal fracture. Garden dome charges final image; choreography coherent through spiral stair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle solace via garden) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through passage discovery to realization; agency in card-tracing forecloses leaving path with felt endurance cost. Escalation reweights via deepening self-echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity's acceptance emerges organically from garden blossoms and twin echo; final ship-as-"trapped freedom" image offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting narrative threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (seeing "narrative threads"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in dense metaphors ("mosaic of two lives stitched," "DNA helixes") across garden beat (-0.3), but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera twin on aberrant carnival ship transforms self-discovery tropes; garden's living names and "trapped freedom" reweighting feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
