<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority embodied via heartbeat echoes and compass tug; grandmother's ritual anchors motivation to explore. Final departure earned through prior causal build of isolation vs glimmer. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "true north of the heart" borders unearned but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of sensory echoes builds to glimpse as tightening, culminating in Charged Poise of drifting with legible cost in "last glimpse of the station's silhouette." Orientation anchored early in deck and post-shutdown. No lens ambiguity; closure reconfigures isolation via resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deck's spin constrains escape window via rotation shift; compass and sketchbook as micro-settings charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (star ribbons, air hiss). Details evolve causally from dome to void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation vs glimmer pursuit signaled early; glimpse as agency-driven deepening narrows to exploration under accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in forsaking station's "rusted hull" for void. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of direction as choice emerges via sketches/compass motif shifting from memory-tether to forward promise. Final image resonates but "direction is a choice, not a destiny" nears explicit moralizing, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature in echoed silences and temporal dilation; rhythmic modulation heightens stretched beats. Prose texture distinct and biased to sky-sketching idiom. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical rhythm propels but paraphrase loops on "silence" (empty/ghost/echoed/own) and "stretched time" across reflective beats dull density. Minor synonym churn on compass gleams/pulses; no closure harm. High info density overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sci-fi abandonment transformed via heirloom compass and anniversary sketches into lyric exploration rite. Risky poetic voice synthesizes isolation tropes freshly; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
