<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in belief that luminous vows hold restorative code, compelling adjustments at climax; gently meticulous trait shown through calibrated movements. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reducing internal conflict depth. Quiet satisfaction at end feels earned but lacks embodied cost on pivotal projection beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via flickering slide and dimming light, holds to Charged Poise closure where projection renews shelves temporarily with felt cost of inevitability. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (chief at podium in frozen library). Single scene causality builds density through recalibrations to harmonic emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (breath fogging, shelves creaking, needle flickering) reflects meticulous POV bias toward light/frequencies. Environment constrains via creaking ice under forgetting, charging final image of glowing edges. Selective details evolve causally with projection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore library via vow's frequency) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through unstable readings to pinpoint harmonic, narrowing options with agency in adjustments. Visible cost legible in temporary ward: "a temporary ward against the inevitable fading." Coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning from oblivion emerges organically via measurements yielding queen's vow, reweighted in final projection without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in library's renewed glow amid fading illusions. Complexity in temporary preservation avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of precise light-tracing; lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to hum at peak. Purposeful repetition teaches poetic texture, legible at closure. Minor register elevation in abstract phrases like "luminous thread" fits fantasy voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "while illusions fade to memory," "edge of oblivion," "quartz hush" across 10+ instances) create synonym churn and template cadence, dulling propulsion. Redundancies in final third (multiple ledger closings, vigils) obscure closure image. Figurative density overwrites without payoff in high-pressure projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline library, frequency-sampling lantern for memory vows transforms preservation trope via specific physics of light/resonance. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern. Bold lyric risk-taking heightens atmospheric stakes without gimmick.</comment>
