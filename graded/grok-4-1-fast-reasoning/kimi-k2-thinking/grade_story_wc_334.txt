<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's hands-on trait drives consistent micro-choices like climbing the *Mariana* and cultivating spores, revealing a hierarchy of values where curiosity overrides tetanus fear; final sating of curiosity earns a credible renunciation with felt cost in "never return again." Contradictory impulses surface in embodied nostalgia stinging his eyes against preserved pain. Minor flaw: reflective summaries slightly abstract some internal conflict pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: memory return → investigation → pattern detection → spore cultivation → placement unlocks greenhouse realignment and CR closure, with cost in realized unbearable truths ("some truths are broken constellations that cut"). Orientation anchored early in sunken greenhouse and 1983 reference. One tightening via missing Pleiades star narrows to mushroom solution; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Specificity exceptional: shipwreck masts, shattered glass panes, rotting orange tree constrain choices like chalking on *Mariana*'s deck and bait cooler cultivation, charging final glowing mushroom beacon. Sensory hierarchy folklorist-biased toward patterns over peril; evolves causally as panes realign. Micro-setting (dinghy, cooler) alters tactics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early, escalates causally through October vs. August deadline tightening to hands-on cultivation; agency in spore-tending forecloses passive waiting with spore/smell cost persisting to end. Climax placement forces trade-off: recovery reveals protective theft. Minor: time jumps slightly abstract one live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity's double edge emerges organically from particulars like shipwreck Pleiades mirroring preserved trauma, culminating in CR: "some constellations are meant to stay broken" reweights endless digging without moralizing. Final journal and dream images recharge prior motifs with lingering ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature pattern-obsessed (angles, spores, spirals); voice texture poetic yet grounded in sailor chants, modulates rhythmically to charged poise in "hands still smelling of salt and spores." No dialogue; purposeful compression in time elisions legible under causal lens. Minor: occasional elevated diction edges POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring curiosity's dig; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs. Minor artifacts: "chronically curious" (3x) and "crisp nostalgia" (3x) motif-taught but borderline loop in reflective beats; no closure touch, no filter stacks. Rhythmic control strong under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: faerie memories encrypted in shipwreck Pleiades, unlocked by cultivated mushroom, transforms folklore into geometric ingenuity; risk in nonlinear memory flood heightens stakes. Irreplaceable premise details like *Mariana* chalking inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
