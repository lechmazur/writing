<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in harnessing dying star's light drives concrete micro-choices like leaf on sensor and escapement tweak; interiority embodied in "heart a quiet drum" and "luminous ache." Minor slip in unearned epiphany phrasing like "the ephemeral had been harnessed... by listening" borders diagnostic without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density of spin, whisper, light builds to RR closure where clock aligns to leaf's cadence, steadying observatory with cost of star's fade legible in "moment captured yet slipping away." Orientation anchored early in observatory and Kael's role; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lunar observatory and workshop micro-setting constrain via shaking foundations and crust tug, charging final image of "captured starlight" in walls; sensory hierarchy privileges sound (leaf rustle, tick) amid urgency. Gears "glinted like frozen starlight" integrates purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture starlight pre-tearaway) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clock symptom to leaf-cadence bind narrowing options; agency in tweaking escapement forecloses unchecked spin with cost of fading star felt in crystal image. One tightening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral harnessed by listening emerges organically from leaf-spin-light particulars, reweighted in final "leaf fell again... nothing ever truly vanishes" without moralizing. Resonance avoids platitudes; minor friction in near-explicit "by listening" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sound-biased noticing ("faint rustle... sliced through the hum"); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise in closure, consistent lyric texture. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "luminous ache" motif loops 4x creating patterned echo yet minor churn in final third; no scaffold, but repetitive "leaf" phrasing (whisper, fall, dust, fell again) dulls peak slightly. Rhythm varies purposefully for lyric build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera repair as time-binding via leaf sound transforms sci-fi tropes; lunar crust tug and photon preservation feel inevitable from particulars, with bold risk in acoustic restructuring heightening stakes organically.</comment>
