<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the crucible scene, with mechanical duty clashing against human-tugged "sunlight on skin," earning her refusal with identity-cost in migration. Interiority is concrete and embodied via gears storing "tidal memory." Final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: creel arrival accumulates density to pattern break at partial-smelt refusal, landing Charged Poise closure where creel-as-artifact reconfigures preservation with cost in her "fluctuating self." Orientation anchors by para 2. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final cataloguing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal atrium and creel constrain choices—geothermal crucible demands smelting, tide threatens submersion—charging final transmuted image. Sensory hierarchy (reed through "moon-phase sensors," bamboo darkening) reflects Elara's mech/human bias. Micro-setting (warming stones) enables gradient metabolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smelt vs preserve wonder) signaled early, deepens via creel contradiction under Accumulative lens to cadence shift in halfway vents, forcing trade-off with identity cost. Agency in refusal forecloses full mechanical path. Moral calculus (preservation requires loss) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence via contradictions emerges organically from creel-weave transmutation, reweighting routine as "futile and eternal" in final image without statement. Resonance from particulars like "half-bamboo and half-crystal" artifact lingers with ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: mech precision ("binary," "protocols") biases to human "breath" under moon tug. Rhythmic diction modulates from dawn observation to climax pressure without drift. Prose as character reflects fluctuating mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "brass exoskeleton creaked with tidal memory" advances setting/character); rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at refusal). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful tidal repetition taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tomorrow tidal archive transforms migration trope via creel refusal, with risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightening stakes. Conceptual integrity commits to moon-fluctuating cyborg without retreat; final "fish swimming through woven spaces" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
