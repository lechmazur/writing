<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under ghost's urging presence reveal reticent traits compelling the bottling act; interior contradiction in comfort/unsettle drives protection. Minor label reliance like "reticent heart warmed" slightly abstracts peak warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from lamp failure to ghost presence tightening stake; closure as Charged Poise in relighting and ghost fade with "luminescent ache" settling into bones as legible cost. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sea glass and bottle as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final cairn placement; sensory details like "salt crust" and "briny air" filter through observant POV, mirroring internal ache. Final lighthouse image recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect light/sanctuary signaled early, deepens via ghost pressure forcing bottling renunciation; agency in relighting forecloses falter with emotional cost felt in bones. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bottled safety emerges organically via letters, glass, note; final cairn/bottle image offers resonant CR reweighting fragile light's promise without moral. Complexity in ghost's dual warmth/ache lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with perceptual signature in observant details like "rust on iron railing"; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to charged relighting. No head-hopping; elision of letters taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "luminescent ache" motif, but minor paraphrase loops in glow descriptions ("glowing faintly," "faint glow," "bottle’s glow") dull propulsion slightly before closure. Rhythm varies; no major artifacts touch relighting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stone-stacking messages and bottling sea glass synthesize fresh angle on haunted solitude; risk in quiet supernatural Charged Poise heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
