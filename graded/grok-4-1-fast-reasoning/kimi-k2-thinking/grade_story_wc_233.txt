<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment motivates climb and acceptance convincingly, with embodied strain ("silk slippers already soaked") revealing contradiction between duty and dream-pull; transformation at "memories were already fading" earned by prior pressure, but lacks deeper internal contradiction acting simultaneously in pivotal vision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from climb perils to grotto vision; CR closure lands cleanly at "you were never the dreamer, but the dreamed" with legible cost in fading memories and throne surrender; orientation anchored early in "base of the impossible mountain," no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "frost etching lacy menace" and "mineral water that caught the bleeding starlight" filter through queen's priorities, constraining climb and charging final image; recurring starlight as micro-setting reweights transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via climb dangers and vision revelation narrowing options to guardianship; agency in "She thought of the court below...found she no longer belonged" forces trade-off, but cost feels more conceptual than viscerally tightening in climb's peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of power-as-sacrifice emerges organically from particulars like prior queens' visions and star-ember crown; final image of "snowdrops to push through permafrost" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting dreams as bloodline curse/invitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in patterned noticing ("frost etching lacy menace," "bleeding starlight"); rhythmic texture modulates intensity, but minor register elevation ("baptism and erasure") strains queen's idiom slightly in transformation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but overwriting via figurative stacks ("starlight bled across the stones like silver wounds") and minor loops (repeating "closed her eyes," "disenchantment") in peak transformation dull closure image; template cadence in repetitive image stems ("bled," "bleeding") triggers deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic queen-sacrifice via dream-cycle and star-ember fireflies transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens eternal-watch resonance without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight from recurring dream motif.</comment>
