<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation via reciprocity pact drives plan-hatching recognition and climax sharing, but interiority remains abstract with no contradictory impulses acting in scene; desperately jocular trait shown in laughter softening at "harmonious resonance," yet embodied emotion lacks specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rumor density builds to pattern break in clock tower glow, delivering Charged Poise RR with legible cost in Mira's pre-sunrise departure embedding the rock; orientation anchored early in station description; one tightening via chain transformation suffices, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and rusted clock tower constrain climax staging and charge final image as walls "thrummed with... resonance" and rock embeds in cornerstone; selective sensory details (shimmering ivy, pulsing silver light) mirror internal shift purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness) signaled early via satchel keepsake tightens accumulatively through rumor chain to collective sharing narrowing options to hope; agency in Mira's orchestration forecloses isolation with felt cost in her genuine laugh and vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity curing loneliness emerges organically from rumor trades to final glow merging memories, offering resonant non-literal answer in rock's ongoing invitation without moralizing; counter-reading ambiguity in Mira-as-rumor lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fable-like third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward whispers and glows modulating rhythmically to peak at "thrummed with the harmonious resonance"; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy confessions building to long resonant sentences at climax glow; high density integrates action/image without loops, minor repetition of "shared" purposeful for textural accumulation; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logistician weaving moon rock rumors into communal hope transforms tropes of isolation via improbable chain; risk in polite anarchy tone heightens closure without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight from early pact.</comment>
