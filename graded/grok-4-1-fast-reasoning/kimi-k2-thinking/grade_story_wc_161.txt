<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in dust-mapping and pigeon releases reveals contradictory impulses of loss versus trust; final rebirth earned via cumulative micro-choices. Minor over-articulation of epiphanies like "a man reborn" borders on unearned. Closing ledger moment shows credible endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of releases and mappings builds to Charged Poise closure in "dust motes settled... new tune," reconfiguring trust with felt cost of fragile preservation. Orientation anchored immediately in attic/bookshop. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rickety beam and skylight dust constrain balancing/releasing choices; sensory integration (smells, creaks, coos) mirrors internal patterns purposefully. Final dust settling charges closure image. Cap from Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo/trust) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of mappings/releases culminating in final pigeon; cost legible in "whispered a song he thought he had lost." One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragile bloom/wither emerges organically from dust/pigeons/songs; final "between memory and dream" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Cap from Q7.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of pattern-seeking; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative texture. No dialogue. Cap from Q7.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive dust-swirl phrasing and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple "Elias smiled," blooming/withering echoes) create template cadence across final third, dulling propulsion; −1.2 artifacts obscure closure image slightly. Rhythmic intent evident but overdone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeons, meteorite, dust-mapping transforms memory trope into textured trust arc; risky lyricism heightens stakes. Cap from Q7.</comment>
