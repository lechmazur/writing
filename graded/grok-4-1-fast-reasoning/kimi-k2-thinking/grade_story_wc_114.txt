<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle's motivation to quantify swallowed truth drives concrete actions like tracing smudge and weighing illustration; internal conflict embodied in "stone in her chest" and contradictory certainties. Earned change via forgiveness realization forecloses burden with felt release cost. Minor slip: epiphanies like "forgive" word feel slightly unearned without more contradictory impulses in peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from smudge discovery to scale wavering to CR closure where forgiveness reweights truth's premise with emotional cost in "weight...finally lift." Orientation anchored early in station post-fever. One tightening via memory surfacing narrows to forgiveness; lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station instruments and aurora constrain choices (scale for illustration weighs truth uncertainly); sensory details like "green ribbons weaving sorrow" filter through oracle's weather bias, mirroring internal sway. Recurring margins charge closure by holding illustration as liminal release. Micro-setting (logbook, scale) guides search without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via smudge-map, faded note, scale—narrowing to intangible forgiveness with release cost in "no longer a burden." Agency in margin occupation and letting go forecloses measurement path. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight in forgiveness emerges organically from particulars (smudge to "forgive," scale failure); auroral sorrow motif shifts from echo of heaviness to internal peace without statement. Final image reconfigures central question non-literally via "quiet note in the margin." Resists tidy moral via lingering melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (weather/chaos metaphors like "holding conflicting forecasts") stable in single close POV; rhythm modulates from sway to release. Purposeful compression in reflections anchors to cues (smudge trace). No head-hopping; diction fits oracle's peripheral idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in weight/aurora/sway repetitions dull density (e.g., multiple "swaying certainties" and "auroral sorrow" restatements across ending). Rhythmic variety supports lyric propulsion, but synonym churn in release descriptions triggers -0.8 artifact cap. Closure image clear despite minor redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather oracle reading personal chaos via instruments/logbook transforms trope into textural drive; margins as truth-recovery space feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmick. No close famous echoes.</comment>
