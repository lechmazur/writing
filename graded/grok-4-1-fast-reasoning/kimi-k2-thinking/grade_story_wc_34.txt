<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract interiority lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion in pivotal stamping; "felt the motivation to articulate" tells without micro-choices revealing values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR in "courtyard dissolved... ghost drifted upward," cost legible in balladeer vanishing; scribe extension provides one tightening but softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard and mist constrain stamping choices and charge final dissolution image; selective sensory details (mist swirling, thunder breaking) integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating ghost accumulates density to scribe's plate press, forcing release with agency; abstract pressure lacks visceral cost until late surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of voices encoded into enduring art emerges from glyph-song build; final drifting echo offers resonant non-literal reweighting of silence-into-sound premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual bias to shimmering glyphs and humming notes; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition ("ghost in code," "encoded") teaches pattern but paraphrase loops ("encode secrets... messages encoded... encoded love") dull peak surge density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-code ghost and bolt-plate tool transforms ethereal tropes; risk in poetic accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
