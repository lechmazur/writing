<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotions shine in "teeth ache and her bare feet tingle," rooting motivation to find meaning; micro-choices like singing reveal values under pressure. Internal conflict subtle in "high and strange" laugh amid certainty. Minor slip: "awkward confidence crystallizing" tells slightly more than shows pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns (hum, sync, song) build density to Charged Poise closure in final image of "feet still humming" reconfiguring lull with felt cost of defiant certainty amid fading beacon. Orientation anchored early in spaceport bay. Single scene coherent, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stone circle and bare feet constrain choices (palms pressed, feet read floor/memory), charging final "humming earth" image; sensory hierarchy (hum through bones) filters via stargazer's bias. Vivid, selective details like "dust of a failed uprising" evolve with action. Micro-setting as body/tool indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break lull's meaninglessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hum-sync-song awakening systems, narrowing to agency in singing with visible cost (urgent rhythm stirring others). One decisive deepening suffices; cost legible in "storms could be summoned."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence broken via ancient frequencies emerges organically from particulars (hum-song-beacon), resonant non-literal answer in final "hum would remain... whatever would come next" reweighting rebellion's lull without moralizing. Complexity in quiet defiance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in mess/hum) modulates rhythm under intensity; single POV stable, no head-hopping. Compression taught early pays off in charged final image. Prose texture reflects stargazer's mind precisely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short slaps purposefully amid longer lyric beats); high density integrates sensory advance. Minor overwrite in "thunderous serenity... violent peace and silent storm" muddles slightly but pattern-consistent; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi uprising with ancient hum/song as rebellion catalyst feels inevitable; barefoot stargazer's low-tech summoning transforms tropes organically. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
