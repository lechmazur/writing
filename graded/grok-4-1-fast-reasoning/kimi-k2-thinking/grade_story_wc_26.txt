<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve hope clear and intensifies via shadow's growth tying to stone; micro-choice of pressing stone earns change with embodied cost. Internal conflict mild, shown more in regret than simultaneous impulses. Final "heart full of the luminous regret" reveals values hierarchy effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds shadow's boldness, pattern break in metamorphosis reconfigures as RR/Charged Poise. Closure on-page with cost: "cost of a piece of oneself" felt in empty pocket and bittersweet warmth. Orientation anchored early in library edge and archives; one tightening via stone realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library and clouds constrain dusk vigilance and footage access, charging final "shelves now glowing faintly." Stone as micro-setting handled tactilely, reflects POV bias to shadows. Sensory selection purposeful, narrowing to twilight edges under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake preserve hope signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shadow fraying and feeding on aura. Agency in analysis and stone press forecloses destruction path with legible cost in transformation's regret. One decisive deepening changes knowledge/options cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope's preservation carrying loss emerges organically from shadow's veil and "warmth... bittersweet." Final image reweights motif without moral: guardian whispers "of loss." No tidy resolution, ambiguity in regret lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature on dusk/shadows; syntax/rhythm modulate from observation to climax shudder. Stable single POV, no elision issues; diction controlled for poetic texture. Elevated register consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, propulsion builds to metamorphosis beat. Minor repetition ("shape of hope" x3, "luminous" x2) but pattern-taught in accumulative mode, no closure harm. Figurative density purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shareable dreams library + unbound shadow transformed by earth-stone catalyst feels inevitable. Risky lyric style heightens stakes via fragile hope; no tropes untransformed. Final reconfiguration bold yet coherent.</comment>
