<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in collecting/placing objects to understand living houses, embodied in "slipped the shard into his pocket, feeling its weight like a secret prayer." Lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; character reads as competent mystic without struggle or blind spots complicating the realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of noticing/gathering/placing taught early, density builds to town-wide hush. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (noticer, shoreline, spring twilight). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "the houses feel alive because they have been sanctified by the attention of one who notices," reweighting premise with collective sigh cost felt in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid/selective (orris scent "whisper of perfume," beams "humming a low, contented note"), filtered through noticer's perceptual bias toward displaced objects. Setting charges final image ("quiet bay... exhale, a collective sigh") and supplies resources (sea glass, sand-buried shard). No spatial incoherence despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand/sanctify houses) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from one house to town via placements. One deepening in resident's jar thank-you, but lacks opposition or narrowing options; cost felt obliquely in hush's spread without visible trade-off charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of sanctification through noticing/displaced objects emerges organically from repetitive acts, resonant in CR ending without statement. Final image ("perfumer's orris root shard, buried beneath many thresholds") reweights prior material non-literally. Minor drift to platitude in repeated "prayer answered by the living houses."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing "invisible drift of dust, breath of houses"). Rhythmic prose modulates poetically ("hushed blaze, warm"), purposeful repetition taught early as pattern. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coherent under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze" churn synonyms across closure beats, dulling final image). Template cadence in repeated "quiet bay in spring" openings; figurative coherence strains in "silence can be a living thing that fills a room." Propulsion poetic yet momentum drags from redundancy touching ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing as mystical sanctification transforms mundane objects into living hush. Bold lyric risk in accumulative pattern heightens resonance without gimmickry. Core premise (houses breathe via shards) inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes.</comment>
