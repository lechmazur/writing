<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in loss compels puzzle-solving and final endurance; contradictory impulses embodied in compasses as indecision map. Earned change at "He smiled, knowing that fate had been surprised," with cost in bled fingers. Minor slip in archetypal wistfulness without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from reel search to arbor play; closure as Charged Poise in "silence was not empty, but full of the promise," cost legible in clock's silence and bled fingers. Orientation anchored early in station platform. One tightening via map discovery narrows to journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cloud-station and arbor constrain choices—storm rattles glass, bark hums platform for piano; final image charged by "arbor swayed gently, its roots cradling the airship." Sensory selection musical/tactile reflects POV. No white-room; evolves causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surprise fate via encore) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through reel puzzle success then storm-tightened journey to bled-fingers climax. Agency in creative decoding forces trade-off of time/effort. Cost unmistakable in "played until his fingers bled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of defiant longing emerges organically from motifs shifting meaning—steely notes to softened hope; final image reweights without moralizing: "steely longing softened into something like hope." No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in clock's silence. Particulars drive resonance over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (music-cloud metaphors) stable, modulates intensity at peak play; compression purposeful and taught early. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to pianist's longing. Rhythmic control heightens under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in reel-search beat; no loops despite motif recurrence ("horizon invites night" patterned for cadence). Minor scaffold in repeated "steely" phrasing, but purposeful texture; clear propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of film-reel maps and tidal arbor transforms loss trope via creative puzzle and sky-refuge; fresh inflection in encore defying clock-time. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
