<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks concrete internal contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; pivotal gear-turn and mirror-climax moments show competent actions without struggle or embodied flaws, yielding smooth but unpressured motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density building to RR/Charged Poise closure ("rhythm of repair now beat in her own heart"); felt conceptual cost legible in thawing library and pocket-gear reminder reconfiguring frozen stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frozen library and hall of mirrors integrate purposefully, constraining choices (prophecy nook, gear-path, crescent keyhole) and charging final thaw image; sensory selectivity (frost, mist, luminescence) reflects her priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn rhythm of repair) signaled early with accumulative tightening via uncap-mist path to second-gear deepening; agency drives but opposition remains atmospheric/textural only, lacking reversal narrowing live options at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-repair emerges organically from mirror-reflections and gear-mending, reweighted non-literally in final warm-amber shift and pocket-gear image answering wholeness-vs-brokenness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature (professional lens on gears/time); rhythmic modulation purposeful, but no dialogue and minor syntactic repetition borders monotony under sustained poetic intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("hauntingly bright," "driftwood nostalgia") taught early as motif but creates paraphrase loops in final third recaps ("She often returns... walks the line"); dense figuration without variation dulls propulsion across sustained beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-gears and eclipse-prophecy in sky-library premise transforms fantasy tropes through lived poetic progression; risk in pure lyric form heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
