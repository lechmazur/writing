<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mrs. Kaelin's expectantly resigned trait roots her motivation, embodied in tracing the rosette amid student noise; Marco's shift from weaponized voice to pure middle C earns character change with felt vulnerability, though students lean archetypal without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from noisy entry to braided chord via subtraction pattern taught early; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on rosette passed to Marco ("Pass it on"), reweighting vanishing arts with persistent cost of noise's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet library's dust motes and autumn light on rosette constrain teaching choices and charge final image; sensory details (falling leaves mirroring silence) filter through Mrs. Kaelin's priorities, evolving with harmony without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlearning hatred tightens accumulatively as voices subtract noise to form imperfect chord; Marco's hesitated pure note forces bridge-crossing with relational cost, though escalation relies more on pattern than agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony as subtraction emerges from rosette voids and braided tones, resonating in final rosette handoff without moralizing; counter-reading of inevitable noise return adds complexity, reweighting premise via "braids are difficult to unravel."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("traveled stillness") modulates rhythmically, stable single POV; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Mrs. Kaelin's nod to Marco), with purposeful compression paying off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short sentences in singing beat), high density integrates image/action; minor paraphrase loops ("vanishing art" recurrences, "expectantly resigned") and elevated diction slightly drag peak harmony without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rosette as negative space for unlearning hatred transforms choir trope into fresh conceptual frame; risk of poetic forward shards heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via persistent method ("subtract noise, find silence").</comment>
