<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Embodied emotions via breathing and crystal pulses ground interiority effectively; micro-choices like extending hand reveal values under spiritual pressure. Minor slip in one-note curiosity without strong contradictory impulses; realizations feel slightly diagnostic without peak embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory surfacing to sparks swirling, culminating in CR closure ("She had found where unused love is stored: within") with felt emotional cost in heart's release. Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viaduct's fog, blooms, and rails constrain perception and charge images like "arches glowed faintly," mirroring internal states through breath-altered views. Recurring crystal as micro-setting enables revelation; selective sensory hierarchy fits POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate stored love) signaled early, escalates via breath-driven vision deepening that narrows to chamber release under accumulative lens. Agency in inhaling/exhaling forecloses hollow with felt chest current; minor abstractness in stakes before pivotal "sparks swirled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved love's internal storage emerges organically from breath/images, reweighting via final CR image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in heart-as-vessel; lingering ambiguity in ongoing pilgrimage avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in light/spark/breath bias; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "Mira felt," "she breathed," and synonym churn on sparks/love across final third dull propulsion (−1.2); template cadence in "Mira [action/emotion]" runs. Figurative density overwrites peak beats without payoff; closure image muddled by redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura pilgrimage, Kwan Yin crystal, and blooming viaduct transforms spiritual trope into breath-driven revelation. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
