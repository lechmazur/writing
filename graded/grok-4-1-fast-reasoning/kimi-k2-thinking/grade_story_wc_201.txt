<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement and trauma responses yield concrete, embodied interiority, with micro-choices like exposing skin revealing contradictory pursuit of pain for insight. Final realization earned via interleaved memories tilting present stance. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("geometry of grace") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds via UV triggers to CR closure in "mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived," reweighting premise with survival cost in final forest image. Reflection shards concretely anchored (e.g., "UV light hit her forearm"), interleaving present actions; single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV forest pulses with proprioceptive moss, ozone, and glowing leaves constrain choices (exposing skin triggers memory) and charge final image of walking through haze. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (teeth ache, weight shifts); body/strap as micro-setting mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) signaled early; accumulative escalation via deepening triggers (forearm UV → interrogator formula) narrows to CR reconfiguration, with agency in reciting numbers and enduring flashes. Cost legible in "ragged edge" vs. gentle slope tension, felt in knee-buckle steadied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mercy's duality emerges organically from trauma data points and UV penance, culminating in resonant CR ("wave and particle") reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in strap's evolving anchor from pain to talisman; minor directness ("mathematics of mercy") avoided in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (precise muscle maps, phantom pains); rhythmic modulation accelerates in memory surges, compresses under stress. No head-hopping or elision withholding; diction biased to survivor's enhanced senses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "brace" loops (4x) and minor paraphrase churn on memories/UV ("violet fire," "violet haze") create template cadence in reflective beats, dulling peak intensity without full pattern payoff. Closure image clean; varied syntax passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive trauma, UV ritual, and mercy-as-equation transforms interrogation tropes into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via sensory math without gimmickry. Pewter strap's duality inflects organically.</comment>
