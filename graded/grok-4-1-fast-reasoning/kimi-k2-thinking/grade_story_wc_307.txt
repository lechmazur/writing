<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in glowing skin and fading form, but pivotal realization ("She realized, with a delayed revelation") feels diagnostic and unearned without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure (Mira fading into starlight as "silhouette dissolving"); cost legible in memory erasure and disappearance; continuous scene with anchored shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond ripples and magnetic grotto constrain choices (reading patterns, pull on cells) and charge final image; selective sensory hush and starlight mirror internal vanishing purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach vanishing to appear) tightens texturally via trance deepening to self-embodiment; agency in pebble casts and pond step forecloses prior state with disappearance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of vanish-to-appear emerges organically from ripple patterns and backward aging; final image ("reflection showed a face both young and ancient") reweights premise resonantly without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with pattern-biased perception; rhythmic modulation fits trance, but minor register elevation clashes in peak realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "vanishing to appear" and ripple motifs (e.g., multiple "rings held truth" variants) dull density without payoff; purposeful rhythm but template cadence in repetitive "She [action]" stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward aging, pond semiotics, and magnetic reversal transforms tropes; risk in lyric cycle heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
