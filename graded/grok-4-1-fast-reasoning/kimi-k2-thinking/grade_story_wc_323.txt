<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation intensifies through teaching choices, culminating in earned realization at Corin's bioluminescence forming Ursa Major. Contradictory impulses (surface desire vs. benthic acceptance) act in meditation scene. Minor epiphanic summary dilutes embodiment in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: anchor lightens as Corin becomes compass, reweighting starlight as internal with conceptual cost of unreachable surface. Orientation anchored early in Pelagia dome. One tightening via Tethian elder's "stars are patterns you carry."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Anchor chain as micro-setting constrains teaching and charges final image, its pits as suns evolving causally. Sensory hierarchy (pressure tugs, vibrations, biolum) filtered through Mara's geometric bias. Benthic details pressure perception expansion without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation in deep) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Tethian intervention narrowing to internal method. Agency in Mara's anchor-as-map choice forecloses surface path with felt cost in "never stand on a deck." Philosophical pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of internal horizons emerges organically from anchor corrosion and biolum reprise, final image reweighting premise without moral. Resonance from particulars like plankton drift vs. stellar memory. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in hope lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with geometric perceptual signature ("edge geometry," pressure layers) stable in single POV. Dialogue subtextual: Tethian's song and Corin's question pursue goals. Rhythmic modulation peaks in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (unfolded horizons), varied rhythm supports accumulative build. Minor paraphrase loops in reflections ("unfolded horizons," "somber marvel") but purposeful, not obscuring closure. No artifacts in peak Corin beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of benthic sci-fi with lyric philosophy; anchor rust as star map transforms relic trope. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via edge geometry payoff. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
