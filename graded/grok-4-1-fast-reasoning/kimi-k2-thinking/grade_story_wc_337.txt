<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's embodied guilt (scars, thrum under fingertips) and micro-choices in unraveling drive internal conflict, with admission "I was afraid" earning the final redistribution of spirits' weight into her bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knot-by-knot density builds to RR/Charged Poise closure; pearl in final knot reconfigures silence with legible cost of "carrying alone," oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary and starlight constrain unraveling (dilutes at dawn), refracting silence/light to charge final net-as-doorway image; micro-setting (needle, net) mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via truth) tightens accumulatively per knot, narrowing from fear to pearl; agency in forbidden method forecloses isolation with felt redistribution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as prison-to-harbor emerges implicitly via unraveling particulars; pearl's "third eye" offers non-literal CR reweighting brokenness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature (mosaic scars, spectral geometry) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful lyric compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; minor figurative density in opening ("spectral geometry... miniature moon") risks overwrite but patterns as voice without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Net-unraveling ghosts and mask-prism synthesis transforms grief tropes organically; risk-taking lyric accrual inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
