<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Guardian's silent empathy and calm presence compel micro-choices like shutter adjustments and mirror sharing, earning the child's transformation; child's fears embodied in shadow lingering then smile. Internal conflict light but consistent in guardian's longing versus eternal vigil. No deep flaws or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken gritty depth for elite publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light patterns densify from guardian's solo weaving to child participation, culminating in Charged Poise CR where child carries mirror as conceptual cost of hope amid ongoing darkness. Orientation anchored early ("cobalt dock glistened after the rain"). One tightening via child's mirror tilt ripples water, reweighting stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dock, water, shutters constrain choices (patterns traced on planks) and charge closure image (guardian merges with dock). Sensory selective: iron/rope smell, rippling glimmers reflect urgency. POV poetic bias filters sky as "bruised," mirroring fears; micro-object mirror evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching child/stars) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via child's approach and shared mirror use narrowing fear to awe. Cost legible in child's "unspoken grief" woven into light and guardian's sentinel endurance. Minimal reversal but one deepening (child's question/whisper) suffices; lacks sharper trade-off for 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (darkness cherishing stars) emerges organically from light-weaving events, child's smile as resonant non-literal answer reweighting initial tension. Subtext in silences, implications; no moralizing. Final image ("dock remained, a place where darkness learned") charges without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stable, perceptual signature in spiraling patterns and water pulses; rhythm modulates from tension to poise. Child's single line ("Why do the stars hide?") natural, subtextual. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("teach darkness the value of stars" x4, "silent empathy"/"spiralingly calm" churn) and repetitive stems dull propulsion, obscuring closure image density. Overwriting: metaphors in most sentences ("vortex," "coiled thread," "tapestry") without payoff in peak child interaction. Read-aloud monotonous rhythm from template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror scatters stars on canal, transforming mentor trope via silent light-weaving. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically. No close echoes; irreplaceable mirror/dock fusion inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
