<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's spatially imaginative mind and psychometry yield concrete interiority, with her own unused love for Elena emerging as embodied conflict during the vigil. Contradictory impulses act in the incubation choice, earning the final migration with felt cost. Minor dilution from metaphorical overreach in emotional peaks, like "geometries of emotion," slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds revelations from film touch to map tattoo, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when "map settled into skin, tattooing itself in lines of silver nitrate" with inheritance burden as cost. Orientation anchored early in booth. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth, carbon arc, and theater spaces constrain via love-storage nodes, charging final empty booth image. Sensory details like "smelled of hot metal and celluloid ghosts" filter through Mira's bias. Environment shapes incubation tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find storage before demolition tightens via psychometry deepening and incubation reversal, reweighting under Accumulative lens as film dissolves. Agency in vigil and crystal use forecloses inaction path. Cost legible in tattoo burden, though slightly oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's spatial storage emerges from particulars like "gap between seat G12 and G13," reweighted non-literally in migration closure without moralizing. Resonance from geometries motif charges ending image organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in spatial mappings; voice modulates rhythmically, as in "hushed thunder of revelation built in her chest." Pattern-taught compression legible throughout. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "unused love" and metaphor stacks ("compact as neutron star matter") create slight overwriting in revelation beat without obscuring closure. Varied syntax propels to ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, film incubation, and architectural love storage transforms ghost story tropes via spatial geometries, inevitable in tattoo payoff. Bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
