<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation rooted in sound's physical memory drives concrete micro-choices like off-center lens adjustment; Mara's skepticism applies targeted pressure, forcing relational shift. Internal conflict between romantic belief and dismissal emerges embodied in experiment risks. Minor epiphanic tidiness in final realization slightly undercuts raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to scarred harmonics reveal as CR closure, with carbide lens constraint reweighting digital perfection premise. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening (flawed adjustment) narrows to imperfection proof with felt cost of "dismissed as corrupted data." Final shadows image makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carbide lens as micro-setting constrains choices (centrifuge, refraction) and charges closure image; acoustic panels and holographic grid filter through Kaelen's priorities, evolving with sound layers. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under experiment urgency. Lab pressures tactics via artifact warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture via physical imperfection vs. neural accuracy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lens flaw introducing hidden harmonics; Mara complicates, forcing stance clarification. Agency in deliberate off-centering forecloses perfect transmission path with cost of data dismissal. Visible price in Mara's trembling touch alters relational tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's necessity emerges from particulars like scarred lens and breaking voice; final golden shadows pulsing as remembered heartbeat offers non-literal CR repricing digital assumptions without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's conversion layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable Kaelen-limited POV with perceptual signature in acoustic-light synesthesia; dialogue subtextual (Mara's certainty vs. 0.3% question) advances stakes naturally. Rhythm modulates with intensity, prose texture distinct without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, supporting propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("golden shadows pooled like molasses, thickening the air") risks coherence but pattern-taught via recurrence charges closure without obscuring. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc sound heritage and imperfect optics transforms lab experiment trope; carbide lens as breathing relic risks bold emotional specificity, heightening stakes organically to CR. Inevitable in hindsight from early prism-song setup.</comment>
