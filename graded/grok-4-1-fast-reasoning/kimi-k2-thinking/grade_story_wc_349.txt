<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to quantify absence and remain unincised is embodied in her actions and endurance, revealing internal consistency without tidy resolution. Contradictory impulses subtly act in her choice to self-dose yet not solve her puzzle. Minor abstractness in customer traits slightly limits depth, but vendor carries the weight effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through incisions to vendor's self-application, landing CR closure in "her purpose floating like the library itself—anchored only by the void it filled" with conceptual cost of chosen fragmentation. Orientation anchors immediately in glass orchard on opening day. Pattern taught early pays off without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective: glass floor "ringing," orchard "rustling," clouds "swirling" integrate into action, mirroring absences; bottles constrain incisions and charge final self-spill on palms. Micro-setting of vials guides choices purposefully. Sensory hierarchy fits vendor's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of narrative shedding signaled early, accumulates via customer vignettes tightening to vendor's endurance; one deepening in her self-parole forecloses full resolution with felt cost. Pressure coheres texturally under lens. Minor abstract stakes legibility prevents peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in absence emerges organically from incisions and final vendor image reweighting silence into speech without moralizing. Subtext in "glimmering parole" shifts from customer liberation to vendor's threshold poise. Resonance inextricable from particulars, invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vendor's biased noticing ("quantifying absence," "glass birds"); rhythmic modulation peaks in fragmented incisions. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Only as much as birth"). Stable close third-person, no leakage; elisions taught poetically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful ("frozen music," "puncture wounds") without muddle in peak incisions. Varied rhythm, no loops beyond intentional "scattered" motif. Minor repetition of phrasing ("mindfully scattered") in calm beats nudges below peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of erasure-as-liberation in floating library transforms story-origin tropes; risk in fragmented lyric heightens stakes via irreplaceable "glimmering parole." Vendor's threshold choice feels inevitable from particulars. Bold voice commits fully without hedging.</comment>
