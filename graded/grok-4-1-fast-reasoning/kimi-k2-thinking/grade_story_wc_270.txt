<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—familial duty vs. rebellion rooted in daughter's death—act in scene through decoding and submerging despite burn. Final choice to hand seed to grandson earned by 40-year weave of quiet rebellion, with social cost (traitor label). Embodied emotion concrete: heat climbs arms like living thing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kite tangle to amber crack, culminating in CR where seed reconfigures destiny as cultivation. Cost legible in "This is what we're meant to protect" line, foreclosing passive tradition. Orientation anchored early (steaming path, sacred springs); no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain choice (scalding vent submersion, plant-sympathy mitigates burn). Ferns rustle approval, bamboo directs gaze—recurring plants charge final image of sowing seeds. Sensory selective: iron/smoke syllables, bioluminescent pulse mirror internal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition vs. Covenant obedience) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via reveal: amber-to-seed deepens to force stance crystallization. Agency in unsealing forecloses waiting path; cost visible (burn, word spreads as traitor/prophet). Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: destiny planted in choice, not amber—reweighted by seed pod reveal without statement. Final image of sowing seeds offers non-literal answer, charging prior material (kite script, plant whispers). Complexity in traitor/prophet split avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with plant-biased perceptual signature (bamboo remembers, jasmine translates). Lyrical rhythm modulates: short propulsive sentences at vent ("The amber cracked..."). Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("This is what we're meant to protect").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "gnarled fingers tracing...night-blooming jasmine offered" advances plot/voice/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (roots rewriting story). Propulsion peaks at crack without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plant-telepathy enables kite decode to unseed metaphor, transforming destiny trope into cultivated agency. Risk in quiet CR (seed over embryo) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from bamboo's old-world memory.</comment>
