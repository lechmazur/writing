<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and internal conflict in weighing library dream against empire, shown via trembling fingers and mulberry ache; final renunciation earned by prior telepathy cues and coffee reading. Minor epiphanic summary at end ("perforated destiny... a pattern of choices") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from plant whisper to seed discovery to envoy knock to planting, yielding Charged Poise closure in final planting image with legible cost ("mulberry ache... loss and liberation"). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet observatory and jasmine constrain choices (planting site, telepathy source) and charge final image (seed in central garden under midsummer dawn). Sensory selection (night-blooming jasmine rustle, coffee dregs) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream library vs. empire exploitation) signaled early and deepens via envoy's knock forcing trade-off; agency in hiding violin and planting forecloses funding path with felt ache cost. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens via intensifying plant/coffee cues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed sovereignty emerges organically from seed/memory vs. crop/exploitation, reweighted in final unbroken circle stain and garden image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to perforated destiny via "hole... where something new could grow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (plant murmurs, stain patterns); diction/rhythm modulate from thick shadows to quiet certainty. Brief envoy dialogue natural but minimal; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density but overwriting via pervasive metaphors ("dewdrop on a spider's web," "torn veil") in discovery beats dulls propulsion slightly; minor paraphrase loops on "promise" and "glow" (e.g., repeated dimming). Rhythm varies but figurative muddle in envoy knock beat pulls from 8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice-crystal violin seed, plant telepathy, and coffee divination transforms artifact-hunt trope into memory-garden sanctuary; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via "seed sleeps within the scroll."</comment>
