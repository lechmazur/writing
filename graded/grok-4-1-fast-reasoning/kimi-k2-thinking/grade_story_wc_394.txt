<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zephyr's steadily curious nature roots clear motivation in consistent traits, driving micro-choices like pocketing the arrow tip and nightly transliterations. Interiority feels concrete via "grinning at the absurd beauty," blending awe and irreverence without stock phrasing. Earned endurance emerges as she continues rounds post-resonance, foreclosing complacency with the cost of eternal yearning. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps at very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of discovery, feeding, evolution build density to CR closure where resonator activates, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of unheard peal ("No one in the present could hear it"). Orientation anchors early (workshop, acid sea, Zephyr's job). Single tightening via nightly inputs suffices; final image ("keep going") pays off with undeniable price of impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (groaning machinery, acid hiss, gear teeth whispers) filter through Zephyr's priorities, constraining choices like cart gliding and hovel work. Kaleidoscope as micro-setting charges final evolution image. Environment mirrors internal yearning, evolving causally (buoyancy shift). Recurrent acid sea reflection recharges closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring unheard bell via algorithm) signals early, tightens accumulatively as yearning manipulates buoyancy, forcing Zephyr's ongoing aid. Agency in transliterations narrows options with felt cost (workshop's risky ascent). One deepening via resonator suffices under lens; minor abstractness in bell's payoff prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical desire yearning toward impossible creation emerges organically from particulars like arrow tip's kill-to-creation shift. Final CR image ("eternally ringing") offers non-literal answer to evolution's cost, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in "someday, someone would hear," embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in curious, poetic diction ("grooves that caught the light like a forgotten language") biases toward patterns and artifacts. Stable third-limited POV with clean distance modulates rhythmically under rising evolution pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression teaches lyric accumulative pattern early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, multi-job lines integrate action/atmosphere (e.g., "The workshop shuddered as the algorithm digested"). Minor paraphrase loops ("throughout the evolution" x2) and occasional elevated diction slightly drag, but no closure touch. Varied openings, no artifacts in peak activation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm, kaleidoscope transliteration, and temporal bell transforms tropes into organic whole. Irreplaceable arrow tip's groove patterns drive turns inevitably. Bold conceptual risk (ghost logic, theoretical time) heightens stakes, coherent to irreverent awe closure without gimmickry.</comment>
