<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Solid logical traits drive consistent micro-choices like hypothesis testing and stamping, but emotions lean abstract ("surge of reclaimed stillness") without full embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds discoveries to Charged Poise closure with lights returning as reconfiguration of chaos vs. order; orientation anchored early, cost felt in endured isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (lantern flicker on water-stained walls, musty pages) constrains choices like wick readjustment and charges final steady light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace origins) tightens via hypothesis deepening and conspiracy hint, but external pressure remains low-key, with costs more conceptual than visceral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reclaimed stillness vs. chaos emerges organically from stamping ritual and final image, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable POV with perceptual signature (logical archiving bias) and rhythmic prose modulate effectively; no dialogue, but internal voice coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") creates paraphrase loops across multiple beats, dulling density despite vivid images; affects closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged archive mystery transformed via indexer's stamp ritual, with risk in quiet accumulative drive paying off in resonant end.</comment>
