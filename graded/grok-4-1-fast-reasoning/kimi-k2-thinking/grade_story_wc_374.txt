<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like tasting the ring, with embodied contradiction in her glow and pursuit of mechanical answers amid sensory truth. Internal shift to acceptance earned via carrier's arrival and dialogue, foreclosing proof-seeking with felt cost of unprovable future. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("understanding she had witnessed") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from tastes to convergence of aurora, election, carrier. Orientation anchored early (lavender bluff, Elara's arrival). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page when Elara gives ring and accepts unsolvable, reweighting skepticism with conceptual cost of sensed truth over proof ("souvenir of a future she could never prove").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tin ring as micro-setting constrains choices via taste readings, charges final image in pocket humming toward convergence. Sensory hierarchy (taste dominant) reflects POV urgency; bluff's iron-lavender, wet earth smells guide action without catalog. Aurora/forest details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather-carriers' cause) signaled early, tightens texturally via converging signals narrowing mechanical skepticism to sensory acceptance. Protagonist agency in tasting/deciding to engage carrier; cost legible in worldview forfeiture and ring transfer. Minor abstractness in stakes testing limits escalation charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emergent sensing over solving emerges via particulars like taste-votes, carrier as compromise; final image reconfigures "weather as ballot" without moral, resonating with prior motifs. Subtext in silence post-explanation invites ambiguity on provability. No direct statements; irony in skeptic's glow acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with taste-perceptual signature biasing details; voice modulates lyrically under convergence pressure. Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("You taste the election too"), distinguishes voices via hail-hint vs. skepticism. Rhythmic control sustains lyric texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tastes advance plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, strong verbs. Minor paraphrase loops in ending ("taste of... remained," repeated lavender/ozone) and synonym churn on convergence dull final beats slightly. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; pattern-taught lyricism holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forest elections, taste-compass, weather-as-vote transforms eco-sci-fi tropes organically. Terrestrially cosmic frame commits boldly, with risk-taking in sensory governance yielding inevitable CR. No derivatives; particulars like fungalese waves feel inevitable.</comment>
