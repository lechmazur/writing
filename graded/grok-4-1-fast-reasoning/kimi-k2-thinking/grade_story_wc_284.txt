<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like deliberate digging despite risk, earn the final emotional unclenching; minor label-speak in repeated "prudently daring" slightly abstracts traits without fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkages build cleanly to on-page Decisive Change (passport exchange) with legible cost in the pillbox handover and risked exposure; single scene anchors who/where/when immediately, lens holds through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded bluff and layered snow constrain digging proof and charge thawing final image ("snow beginning its slow melt"); sensory selection (wind-stolen whispers, ghosted breath) reflects spy urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via codes) tightens through causal proof-digging reversal narrowing options; agency in handover forecloses traitor path with felt exposure cost, legible in heart-tighten to unclench progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming broken loyalty emerges organically from code exhumation and Elena reveal, resonating in non-literal thaw image without moralizing; final realization reweights mercy's cost effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward tactical details (footstep sounds, gloved digging); sparse dialogue carries subtext and advances via "You brought what was promised?" without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short stress sentences amid longer builds); no loops or scaffolds, though minor metaphor layering ("silver hush to golden threads") risks slight overwrite but integrates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy redemption via seasonal snow-codes and pillbox key transforms trope through tactile layering and quiet thaw closure; risk in "prudently daring" gamble feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
