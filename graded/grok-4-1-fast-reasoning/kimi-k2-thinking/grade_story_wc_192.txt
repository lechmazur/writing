<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied tenderness in tending shadows and scarred-hand link; motivation to reconcile loss earned through realization "her careful bridge-burning had left a path for him to return." Minor slip: abstract "stoic facade" borders diagnostic in rare smile moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure ("sanctuary...now a vessel for healing"); fading threshold provides legible conceptual cost in final pulse of possibility. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in "ashen charcoal sanctuary."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory filter through POV (thin air, trembling shadows, starlight glint on ring); doorknocker ring as micro-setting charges final altar image and constrains rebuilding motif. Selective ash/starlight details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. reconciliation) signaled early, tightens texturally via shared breathing rhythm narrowing to realization of bridge-rebuilding. Agency in teaching/sculpting breath forecloses suffocation path; cost felt in "fading threshold pulsed faintly."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience in ash emerges organically from breath/shadow particulars, resonant in final "turning suffocation into song." Minor directness in "Breathing is a bridge we build" echoes thesis without full subtext layering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (shadows as breaths/memories); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why do you keep the shadows..."); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels accumulatively but paraphrase loops on "loaded emptiness" (3x) and "teach...breathe" template cadence dull momentum mid-story. Purposeful repetition mostly taught, yet synonym churn on shadows/breath triggers −0.6 in high-density beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-tending as breath-reconciling transforms isolation tropes; risk in poetic compression heightens fragile hope without gimmick. Doorknocker/scar-linking inflections feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
