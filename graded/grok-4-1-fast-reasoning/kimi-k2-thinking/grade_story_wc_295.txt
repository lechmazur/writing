<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via trembling hands and seeing her face in the ancient scribe; motivation shifts convincingly from ambition to shared responsibility with embodied cost. Minor epiphanic summary in final realization slightly undercuts contradiction in peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pulses, glyphs, visions builds to CR closure in "We carried it together" with legible cost of solitary burden foreclosed. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Photometer and Delta Cephei constrain trance method and charge final whisper into eyepiece; sensory details (creaking ribs, mountain wind) filter through POV urgency. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode via trance) deepens accumulatively when face-match narrows options to shared healing; cost felt in trembling hands and foreclosed isolation. Single tightening sufficient, agency in typing final sentence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared resilience emerges organically from glyph confessions and constellation metaphor; final image reweights premise non-literally as daylilies brighten. No moralizing, ambiguity in ongoing vigil lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in stellar rhythms and photonic amber; rhythmic prose modulates from pulsing cadence to dawn hush without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism; minor overwriting in "midnightsolace became tangible" but rhythm varies and propels to closure. No loops or artifacts dulling peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy, lucid dreaming, and temporal lineage transforms trope of isolated genius; variable-star phonemes and daylily memory thread feel inevitable and risky.</comment>
