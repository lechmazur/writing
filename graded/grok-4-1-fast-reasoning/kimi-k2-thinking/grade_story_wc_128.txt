<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in broker traits intensifies to compel award proposal; interiority concrete via noticing details like loose bolts. Minor slips in embodied emotion during Caleb's reveal, leaning on labels over contradiction. Final change earned but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore: envelope slip → investigation → meeting → award; closure as CR in final reflection on endless cycles with emotional cost of tucking locket. Structure spans days coherently via summary shards. Orientation anchored early in waterfront hall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Breezy library under stars recurs to constrain meeting choice and charge terrace event; sensory selection (salty air, old paper) reflects Lena's priorities. Details integrated purposefully without stalls. Environment mirrors internal states subtly in starlit closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplift contributors) tightens via Caleb discovery, narrowing to ceremony; agency in proposing award forecloses solitary path with effort cost. Mild escalation but one deepening sufficient under causal lens. Stakes felt viscerally in Caleb's tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from locket return to movement; final image of tucking locket reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in unspoken harbor heroes avoids moralizing until late. Resonance from particulars like inscription, lingering ambiguity in cycles' unpredictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in noticing manifests/envelopes; dialogue natural, goal-driven (Caleb thanks her). Rhythm modulates but minor register elevation in reflections. No head-hopping, clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "silent contributors," "cycles of compassion") creates template cadence and paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling density. Some synonym churn in harbor details; high-pressure reveal clean but artifacts pervade. Propulsion varies but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms lost-item trope via broker's investigation to award, but core kindness cycle feels template-derived without bold risk. Freshness in inscription detail ("silent contributor"); emotional truth solid but synthesis familiar.</comment>
