<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied emotion peaking in thumb-over-splinters moment revealing contradictory impulses to erase or honor; final winding choice earned by prior ethical burden, foreclosing simpler narrative with felt redistribution cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inscriptions accumulate density to CR closure in tower alignment and bells ringing clear, with conceptual cost of shared betrayal legible in "tower's stones settle"; orientation anchored in opening ridge climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge constrains choice via returning tide deadline; sensory selectivity (crunching glass, salt grooves) mirrors internal precision, charging final "burning mirrors" image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance tightens accumulatively through inscriptions narrowing erase/honor options; agency in pocketing handle forces trade-off, cost felt in redistributed burden at winding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges organically from particulars like carved fragments and tide marks; final image of pendulum arc reconfigures ethical premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in ground's betrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in meticulous noticing (curl of 'g'); rhythmic modulation heightens reverie without leakage, prose texture as character in time-obsessed syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching black glass that sang"); minor figurative density in reverie passages purposeful and un-muddled, no loops obscuring closure winding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal geology and temporal ethics transforms confession trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably in CR, obsidian-time fusion memorable and irreplaceable.</comment>
