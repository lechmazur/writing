<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's forgiving skepticism shines in contradictory impulses like yearning for yet fearing the meeting, embodied in "cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow three decades," compelling her final choice to undo her career with visible cost. Moira's shrewd innocence forces relational crucible without blame. Final renunciation earned by prior reveals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal revelation to accumulative reconfiguration) holds; single scene oriented by ~100 words at estate maze. Conceptual Repricing closure via telescope image reweights certainty premise with career cost legible in "undoing everything I've built." No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Secret garden's yew maze, cracked sundial, rusted trellises, and telescope constrain navigation and charge final image, mirroring internal fractures through tactile navigation. Sensory details selective via Elena's forensics bias. Environment shapes collaborative closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconfigure shattered certainty) signaled early via tooth; Moira's uncle reveal tightens via agency-driven dialogue, foreclosing supernatural theory and forcing career trade-off. Escalation coherent under hybrid lens, cost in "constellations that point to my own failure."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of certainty's cruelty emerges from particulars like quarry mis-ID and tooth; final telescope/morning glories image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting mistakes as "corrections" without moralizing. Subtext in shrewd innocence and bone-setting metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elena POV with perceptual signature (forensics lens on bones/tooth); dialogue natural/subtextual (Moira's soft "You were wrong" pursues revelation). Rhythmic control modulates from tension to poise; voices distinct in idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "words settled like sediment" advances emotion/prose); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and sparse in peak reveals. Propulsion clear to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh mundane twist on changeling folklore via uncle abduction; constellations motif synthesizes forensics failure into innovative nostalgic arc, with telescope risk heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
