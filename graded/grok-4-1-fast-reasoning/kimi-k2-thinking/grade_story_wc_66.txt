<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's diligence and belief in dust singing root clear motivation, with micro-choices like transcribing under cloak aligning actions; interiority concrete in breath fogging and heart quickening. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken depth—no strong flaws complicate peak embedding. Endurance of defiance earned but lacks personal cost visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of images (radio glow, dust, lyrics) tightens toward Charged Poise closure in final dreaming of dust dancing, reweighting story famine with conceptual cost of isolation. Single scene anchors orientation early (alcove, copyist, mist by para 1). One deepening: cipher realization narrows to final coda weaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist curtain, cobalt dial glow, and stone floor constrain choices (hiding radio, glow-revealed staves) and charge final image of luminous ink as beacon. Sensory hierarchy vivid via Mira's priorities: glow pulses heartbeat-like, cold air fogs breath. Details evolve causally, mirroring hope without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end famine via cipher symphony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as lyrics weave into measures, foreclosing secrecy path with felt risk of prying eyes. Agency in transcription narrows options under lens; tomorrow's performance adds cadence shift. Cost legible in muffled heartbeat pulse amid deepening night.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stories persisting via hidden carriers emerges organically from dust motes as scribes, pirate cipher, luminous ink—final image of dust dancing answers famine without moralizing. Resonance from particulars reweights silence into hope; ambiguity in dust's success invites reflection. No tidy resolution, embracing defiant complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: dust as listeners/scholars, glow as secret link. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically ("each speck of dust as a listener"), consistent diction/texture fits hopeful copyist. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful for accumulative feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "dust" (motes, speck, particle, scholar) across final third dull closure image, with repetitive stems ("Mira [possessed/imagined]") creating template cadence. Figurative density overwrites high-pressure transcription beat without crisp payoff. Propulsion strong early but drags via redundancy; rhythm varies but ear-fatigues on echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine, luminous ink cipher, dust storytellers transforms post-apocalyptic trope via poetic logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final dust epic inevitable from early seeds. No template echoes, voice commits boldly to premise without retreat.</comment>
