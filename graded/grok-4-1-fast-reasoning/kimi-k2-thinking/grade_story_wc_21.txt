<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her archivist traits, with embodied retro-cognitive visions (sand in sheets) driving micro-choices; Under-Minister's shift reveals inherited flaws. Contradictory impulses peak in parley nuance without tidy resolution. Minor label-speak ("truth in tension") slightly abstracts, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory fragments build to parley tightening, yielding RR closure in joint disclosure with nuance cost (grandfather's role). Orientation anchors early (zeppelin library, coast). One shard-like reflection block fits BRR; diary-to-debris causality coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zeppelin creaks and holograms constrain parley; debris arrangement charges demonstration moment. Sensory bias (coastal winds, saltwater taste) reflects archivist priorities. Final dunes/lagoon image recharges setting with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt/disclose) signaled early, escalates via parley reversal (Under-Minister flinch); agency in debris demo forecloses classification path. Cost legible in shared silence and nuance trade-off. Lens-appropriate density to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nuanced remembrance emerges from debris cipher and inherited photos, reweighted in "villains and victims sometimes wore the same uniform." Final image answers tension without moralizing. No overt statements; irony in constable betrayal drives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalizes through Elara's perceptual signature (pulsing symbols, reverie bleed). Dialogue subtextual ("terrorists" vs. demo) advances; rhythm modulates from reflective to tense parley. Minor register lift in exposition, but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density overall, but "arranging beach debris as messages" loops thrice and "searing reverie" repeats dull reflective beats (−0.7 paraphrase/template). Rhythm varies; closure image propulsive. Minor overwriting in opening ("pulsed with a weight").</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retro-cognition + debris cipher + zeppelin archive transforms massacre trope via geographical key. Parley ingenuity risks nuance over revelation, heightening stakes organically. No derivatives; irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
