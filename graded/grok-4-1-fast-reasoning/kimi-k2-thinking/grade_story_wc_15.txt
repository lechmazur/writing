<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation to restore glory via weaving sleepwalk patterns, rooted in optimism, but interiority leans on poetic labels like "ghost-light in the gloom" over embodied contradictory impulses in pivotal weaving nights; micro-choices feel summarized rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as nightly paths density-build to tapestry matching grooves, delivering on-page CR/RR closure at alcove discovery—"quiet reverence settle over her"—with felt cost of reweighting village ruin; orientation anchored early in wharf/canyon, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and dust footprints vividly constrain choices, evolving via silver thread to charge final alcove image; sensory selection (rust shadows, loom creak) reflects Elara's priorities without catalog; spatial choreography coherent in labyrinth navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore wharf amid empty boats) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sleepwalk-weave-deepening to discovery turn narrowing doubt; cost legible in villagers' shift from "doubt and curiosity" to embracing broken precedents, agency in sewing/following.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges organically from tapestry mirroring labyrinth, final orchid alcove reweighting optimism without moralizing; subtext in "weaving ruin into reverence" lingers via ambiguity of ghost-chasing folly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (nets "sang of the sea," moon "painted the canyon"); rhythmic modulation in loom creaks blending sighs; no dialogue, voice distinct and consistent under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("after the tide pools emptied" x5, "each night/morning" template cadence across weaving beats) dull density and create scaffold churn; figurative density overwrites high-pressure discovery without payoff; propulsion solid but artifacts obscure alcove image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalk footprints sewn into labyrinth map transforms ruin tropes into inevitable reverence path; risk in poetic optimism amid doubt heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
