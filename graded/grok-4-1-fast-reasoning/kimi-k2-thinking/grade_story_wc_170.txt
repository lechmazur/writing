<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices; painter serene without embodied internal conflict or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy. No other characters for relationships. Feels symbolic archetype over individual with struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs builds to Charged Poise closure as painter fades post-bells, mirrors retain glimmer (cost: fleeting window foreclosed). Orientation anchored early (terrace, painter arrives ~50 words). Repetition slightly blurs causality but pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism parapet droplets constrain and charge painter's tracing/singing (early lines), mirroring internal pulse; echoing terrace amplifies song tactilely. Sensory hierarchy vivid (visual prisms, auditory hush/bells). Evolving post-rain details integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuade mirrors) signaled early, escalates via density/song response/heartbeat quicken under accumulative lens; bells ring as cadence shift foreclosing path (cost legible in fading). Agency in weaving/singing narrows options once meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility-through-art emerges organically via mirrors' glimpses/children's reprise; final image (mirrors remember, world turns) reweights motifs non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in stubborn mirrors/lullaby code avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light pulses, prisms as memories); rhythmic lyric voice consistent, modulating subtly to hush intensity. No head-hopping; elision of painter's backstory purposeful via anchors. Capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("mirrors slowly returned...glimmer" twice; "dusky harmony" churn) and repetitive stems ("She [moved/sang]") dull propulsion across retold beats (−1.2); overwriting metaphors in every peak line obscure density. Read-aloud rhythm poetic but template-heavy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: borrowed-heartbeat painter codes lullabies for mirrors transforms ghostly trope via prismatic tactility. Risky lyric repetition heightens resonance without gimmick. Capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
