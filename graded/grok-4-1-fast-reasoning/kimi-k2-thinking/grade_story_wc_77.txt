<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "allure that pulled at her even as it repulsed," compelling the climax question; final realization earned via causal buildup from vision to clasp use, with scar-like cost visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: photo to clasp to funhouse to entities' confession as CR closure; cost legible in "some doors, once opened, could never be closed—but she now held the handle," reconfiguring survivor power.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glowing footprints and mirrors constrain path to center, charging climax; clasp pearl as micro-setting pulses light to banish fears, mirroring internal shift in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake signaled in advisor's riddles tightens via photo-to-mirror release forcing entity confrontation; agency in asking "What frightens you?" forecloses fear's power with on-page laughter and cracking mirrors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Paradoxes accumulate to resonant CR—"You are the only one who returned"—reweighting fear as amplifier without creation; final clasp as "scar, beautiful and obscene" answers without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias via luminance ("oily sheen," "corrupted gold"); rhythmic control peaks in raw shout "What do you want?" without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere ("plywood grin," "skeletal against bruised twilight") propelling to closure without overwriting in peak entity swirl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of near-death gift inverting fear tropes via "ask it what it fears" turn, grown from dream dictionary paradoxes; risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically.</comment>
