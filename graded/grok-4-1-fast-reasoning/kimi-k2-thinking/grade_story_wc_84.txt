<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "hum of homecoming" felt in chest; perpetual surprise trait consistently frames reactions without safety-hedging. Micro-choices like drone launch and pinion sequence reveal values under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from drone trails to glyph to pinions; CR closure in "waveform of emotional resonance" reweights belonging with conceptual cost of truths "too bright for mortal eyes." Orientation anchored early via drone at observatory; one tightening via glyph suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orrery's brass gears and copper air constrain pinion sequence; dusk's "brilliant dimness" mirrors internal states and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy sharp-eyed via astrographic sensors. Recurrent stone/silicon motif evolved through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode frequency) signaled early, tightens via glyph discovery narrowing to celestial sequence; agency in pinion pulls forecloses failed decoding path. Felt cost in pilgrim's flight understood at climax. Minor abstract stakes before chip handling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges via chip's emotional waveform, reweighted in transmission chorus without moralizing. Final image of "wheeling stars" as "universe's infinite type" answers central question resonantly. Particulars like star trails avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sharp-eyed catches ("algorithms missed"); rhythmic control modulates from humming rotors to "faint hum of belonging." Stable third-limited POV; no elision issues. Voice texture poetic yet propulsive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "boots echoing off stone that had witnessed three civilizations"; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor repetition of "perpetually surprised" (3x) and "brilliant dimness" creates template echo in reflective close, docking from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silicon drones decoding ancient "typeface" of cosmos; belonging as frequency transforms sci-fi trope. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes via emotional waveform realization. Inevitable hindsight from star trails to transmission.</comment>
