<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to merge timelines roots in consistent resilience traits and compels her actions, with embodied emotion in "heart beat in sync" and holding fast against tugs. Internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; positivity feels declarative rather than flawed. Final endurance earned but without deep prior struggle, balancing competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from radio tuning to final snap, with pattern break in timelines clasping as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored early in ferry setup. Closure cost legible in "permanence settling... yet fleeting," reconfiguring transient home with felt endurance price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spectral grotto and starlight constrain merge via humming walls and filling hourglass, charging final glimmer image. Sensory details (damp rail, salt air, hum) selective through Lina's pattern focus, vivid without catalog. Ferry choreography coherent, evolving with flicker to solidity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor ferry via merge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to tug at "her edges" forcing hold, narrowing to fleeting win under lens. Agency in radio pulses and spirals drives escalation; cost in temporary clasp unmistakable on shudder-to-sigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of permanent transience emerges organically from hourglass/threads/starlight shifts, reweighting resilience in final "emptiness... full of possibility" without moralizing. Subtext in fleeting merge invites ambiguity on endurance's cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to patterns/clocks; voice rhythmic, modulating to hum/sigh under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-pursuing ("Time’s sand ran out"). Minor repetition in phrasing but consistent diction fits deckhand lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("resiliently positive," "empty hourglass," "timelines merged/vanished") create paraphrase churn across ending, dulling closure image; synonym cycles in starlight/pool/thread. Heavy figurative density without payoff in peak merge obscures propulsion. Rhythm varies but template stems ("Lina [action]") in finale drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-slip ferry with radio/hourglass patterns transforms trope into poetic endurance arc. Risky lyric accumulation heightens transient stakes organically. Final "anchor and sail" reconfiguration feels inevitable from early ripples.</comment>
