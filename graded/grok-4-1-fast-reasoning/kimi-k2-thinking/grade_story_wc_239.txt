<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through dictionary touch and footsteps as punctuation, revealing contradictory observer-claimant impulses; final merger earns change with embodied cost. Lacks sharper micro-choices under arbitration pressure before whisper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to whisper reversal and CR closure ("Paper became bone..."); cost legible in surrender of possession at "final image reconfigures options." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via journey suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library's paradox halls and nautilus shelves constrain footsteps and charge merger image; sensory dust motes and page flutter filter through witness bias. Micro-setting (dictionary-as-body) elevates pivotal unification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify before hiccup ends) signaled early, tightens via arbitration whisper forcing recognition; agency in "journeying inward" forecloses possession with felt conceptual cost. Escalation coheres texturally without causal slips.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-surrender emerges from dictionary evolution, resonant in non-literal merger answering unification question; reweights illusions without moral. Final image ties protagonist arc organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable surreal POV with biased perceptual signature (illusions as moths); rhythmic diction modulates to hushed intensity. Minor register elevation fits cosmic voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with propulsion in journey beats; high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loop ("resounding hush" echoes dull closure slightly); figurative stack coherent but heavy in arbitration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic witness in time-defiant library transforms end-of-history trope; dictionary-blood codex risks surreal payoff heightening stakes inevitably. Bold pattern holds without gimmick.</comment>
