<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zen potter's motivation roots in embodied curiosity ("hummed beneath her ribs"), intensifying through micro-choices like pressing palm to hive and shaping clay under thrum guidance; final offering and carried resonance earn change with conceptual cost. Contradictory patience vs. entropy acts in scene without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering discoveries (lantern images to thrum to realization); CR closure in "horizon that might one day bloom" reweights premise with conceptual cost of spreading secret against wasteland. Orientation anchored early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hive boxes, rosemary, hidden spring constrain choices (kindling, clay source) and charge final bowl placement; POV filters via pottery lens ("silvered by... sun," "bent time... like a glaze"). Sensory economy vivid, purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through lantern revelation and thrum embodiment, narrowing to active care practice; cost legible in leaving relic ("absence as a kind of fullness") and indifferent wasteland.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of love's architecture emerges from particulars (gentle handling stored as sustenance, bowl nests relic); final bee messenger and "love's architecture" reweight entropy premise non-literally, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light/clay metaphors, "patience of clay settling"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, e.g., short sentences in firing ("The flames moved with the same sharp gentleness"). No elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax ("She wedged clay... its moisture another impossibility"); pottery metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor repetition ("thrum") purposeful, pattern-taught; no loops dull closure image of bee vanishing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal memory in phototropic oasis transforms entropy trope via pottery logic; risk in fabulist lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "some resistances were not stubbornness, but love's architecture."</comment>
