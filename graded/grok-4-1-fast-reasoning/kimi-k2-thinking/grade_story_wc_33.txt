<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mailman's motivation rooted in past failure intensifies through concrete micro-choices like tucking the scrap into the bottle, earning the final felt release of "the weight of the promise"; embodied guilt and competence balance without diagnostic labels. Internal conflict subtle in his "respectfully rebellious" endurance against the border. Past reflection anchors tightly to present drone launch without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs of storms, neon, absences densify to Charged Poise closure in mother's tears and mailman's watched relief, reweighting his premise with legible emotional cost ("weight...finally delivered"). Orientation anchors firmly by para 2 (mailman, disputed zone, twilight arcade). Single scene, one tightening via drone slip-through.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's neon/ozone constrains drone launch and liminal drop; twilight pause enables crossing, charging final alley image. Sensory hierarchy (clicking boots, humming rotors, static crackle) reflects mailman's priorities, evolves with drizzle. No white-room; micro-setting (rooftop, fire escape) tracks spatially precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle healing message) signaled early, tightens texturally via storm-mask success narrowing detection risk; agency in launch forecloses failure path with past guilt as felt cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to mother's receipt crystallizing stance. Moral calculus in linking absences vs. border policy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending absences emerges via bottle's lightning message shifting from haunted invention to kept vow, resonant in final image without moralizing. Subtext in neon ghosts, fragile threads invites ambiguity of ongoing border. Protagonist arc inextricable from promise-healing question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (storm hums, clinking glass as beacons) biased to mailman's inventor lens; rhythmic modulation peaks at launch ("silent prayer against brittle hush"). Minimal dialogue natural, goal-pursuing nod to owner. No head-hopping; compression purposeful for lyric drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsion (e.g., "glass glowing...beacon for the eyes"); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Minor metaphor density ("neon veins...heartbeat") in setup fits taught lyric pattern without muddle at drone climax. No loops/scaffold; "brittle hush" reprise purposeful. Slight overwriting in repeated promise phrasing caps band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm-bottle drone synthesizes smuggling ingenuity with promise-healing, transforming border trope via inventor mailman's specifics; final lightning-script image inevitable from setup. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; fresh premise commits to sci-fi logic fully.</comment>
