<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Driven keeper's regret embodied in precise actions like arranging driftwood; internal conflict between escape and embrace acts in scene via flute hesitation. Final renunciation of forgetting earned through prior micro-choices. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "embracing the fracture" slightly abstracts peak insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds to CR closure where "failure... not a wall but a door" reweights premise with conceptual cost of endless guardianship legible in final flute-as-bridge image. Orientation anchored early; single-shard coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range constrains path and charges closure via glowing markers mirroring choices; canyon hush and gravel crunch selective, POV-filtered sensory weave into action. Driftwood and flute as micro-settings evolve to reconfigure options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insights from failure) signaled early; deepening via flute seam revelation narrows to endurance of burden under accumulative lens, with agency in hesitation and resolve. Cost felt in "guardianship never truly ends"; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-door emerges organically from flute seam, markers, hush without statement; final image reweights guardianship premise non-literally via bridge metaphor. Complexity lingers in fracture's dual key/lock nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward silence/symbols; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from tension to poise, fitting accumulative texture. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful for lyric drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel meditative beats; purposeful hush/flute recurrences pattern-taught without loop. Minor overwriting in "avalanchingly quiet" simile cluster slightly muddles one peak but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic guardian mythos with world-weaving flute transforms tropes via fracture embrace; risk in lyric CR pays off in hindsight inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
