<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions in "heart beat in serene upheaval" reveal character under pressure; motivation intensifies credibly to salvage action. Weakness in label-only traits like "thoughtfully clear" and alternating summaries of instincts reduce interior contradiction specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from barge creaks to hidden chamber discovery; orientation anchored early in canal scene. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in map salvage and "weight of truth reclaimed," with felt conceptual cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial shadow concretely constrains choice to recessed arch; phosphorescent moss and canal ripples integrate purposefully through POV-biased action. Sensory hierarchy reflects quest urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; recurring sundial charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to untangle lies signaled early, tightens accumulatively via water ripple and stone press, narrowing to salvage with visible cost in "turbulent discovery." Protagonist agency drives reversal; moral calculus between myth and truth sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging truth from lies emerges organically through map mosaic and final unfolding; resonant non-literal answer in sundial promise reweights premise. Minor drift from repetitive "architecture of lies" phrasing slightly abstracts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensing "subtle tremors of untruth"; poetic diction like "liquid ribbon" modulates rhythmically. Capped by line artifacts; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "architecture of lies" (repeated 4x) and radio silence create redundancy across beats, dulling closure image; dense metaphors in every high-pressure sentence lack pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion. Template cadence in reflective stems ("She recalled," "She imagined") triggers −0.6; artifacts pervade final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of literal "architecture of lies" as tunnels transforms quest trope; poetic conceit of radio silence as veil-thinner risks boldly without gimmickry. Sundial as time-bending lens feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
