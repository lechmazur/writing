<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to notice and preserve the sacred in ordinary drives concrete micro-choices like hiding the bread relic and guerrilla planting, with embodied emotion in smelling yeast ghost. Internal consistency shines in gentle rebellion without overt conflict, though group reactions feel slightly archetypal. Final endurance earned via prior acts; no major unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo relic-carrying to group ritual, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) in scattering crumbs—"Let this be everything we forgot to mourn"—reconfiguring forgetting into witness with emotional cost legible in tears and kneeling. Orientation anchored early (Mara, bakery, palace by para 2). Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (frost-nipped streets, wax paper crinkle, mossy fountains) filter through Mara's noticing bias, constraining choices (hidden tea house evades officials). Recurring courtyard evolves causally, charging final image of wet earth/possibility; yew tree and ivy mirror persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refuse creeping normality) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via witnesses gathering to ritual tightening, forcing stance crystallization in shared scattering with felt cost (tenuous absolution). Agency in attention/planting forecloses surrender path; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noticing sacred ordinary emerges organically from particulars (seedlings, bread crumbs), reweighted in final image of courtyard as shrine and future garden without moralizing. Resonance from creeping beauty vs. normality; "conspiracy of silence" line implies without stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Mara, perceptual signature in precise tastes/memories; voice texture poetic yet grounded (e.g., "stone-hard" bread). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("We let it disappear"), advances ritual; no head-hopping despite group.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short frost sentences to longer ritual), high density integrates action/image; minor metaphor density in opener ("ghost of yeast") purposeful, no loops or muddle touching closure. Propulsion strong through selective phrasing; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality via bread-soil sacrament and guerrilla gardening transforms trope into heuristically gentle persistence; risk in quiet ritual closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early noticing.</comment>
