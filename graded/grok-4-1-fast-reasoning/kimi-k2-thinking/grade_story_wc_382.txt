<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mrs. Voss compellingly embodied via precise actions like "measuring sugar...with theatrical precision"; Alex's motivation intensifies credibly to seal-pressing choice, though lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from sugar-borrowing motif to basement CR, where seal-pressing reconfigures Alex as scribe with conceptual preservation cost legible in "now you speak for it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Building's "mortar whispered in a dialect" and basement graffiti concretely constrain choices and charge final image, with rooftop meteors punctuating climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to preserve building's "authentic grammar" tightens via renovation whisper—"they're planning to renovate"—forcing seal act with ongoing cycle cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Preservation vs. erasure theme emerges via layered images like nurses' graffiti, answered non-literally by final sugar-cycle image reweighting memory's negotiation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature—"fire escapes seemed to conjugate verbs"—holds stable POV with rhythmic control heightening textural pressure to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Purposeful metaphors like "punctuation marks of the sky" propel density without muddle; "patiently nimble" motif repeats slightly but supports voice without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh architecture-as-dead-language synthesis transforms tropes, with seal-pressing turn inevitable from established grammar motif.</comment>
