<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to teach silence emerges concretely through embodied monitoring and micro-adjustments, earning the diplomat's change without unearned epiphany. Internal consistency shines in vial trust over mechanics. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in Kael caps perfection; diplomat's arc feels lightly stereotypical early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in noise monitoring to Charged Poise closure, with vial handover reconfiguring the diplomat's stance and felt emotional cost in weeping. Single scene oriented early at Meridian Station. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and resonance panels constrain choices like harmonic adjustments, charging closure as terrace rotation mirrors vial spirals. Sensory hierarchy via Kael's professional notice of noise prisms feels lived-in. Micro-setting vial integrates tactilely across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of catalyzing silence comfort tightens accumulatively as diplomat's red heartbeat shifts to blue via Kael's agency, foreclosing his anxious drone with on-page weeping cost. One decisive deepening suffices. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence-as-presence theme emerges from monitoring particulars and vial reprise, resonating in "Now you carry it with you" without statement. Final image reweights transit premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in quiet's dual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in noise/vial metrics stable in single POV, modulating rhythm with hush intensity. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in Kael's low breath-voice. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with hush propulsion; high density weaves action/image sans loops or scaffolds. "Fluidly logical" repeats purposeful, not churn. No figurative muddle in peak diplomat shift; read-aloud flows seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prismatic silence physics transforms transit trope via vial's chemical quiet, risking lyric hush without gimmick. Conceptual integrity in atmosphere-as-music feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold perceptual frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
