<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under shame, like trembling fingers mixing poultice and burning brochures, reveal contradictory impulses toward self-recrimination and compassion; earned renunciation of past self feels character-particular. Minor therapy-speak slip in "Self-respect meant not being a fool again" borders abstraction but anchors to present salve action without flattening closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single continuous scene with early orientation (workshop, post-con, Elara); density builds from shame to tending/drafting, tightening to Charged Poise RR at door-knock with felt cost of public shame and fragile forward commitment. Closure image of chameleon's trusting tail spiral reconfigures options legibly with undeniable price; one deepening suffices flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (cedar/jasmine/mist/stars) filters through handler's priorities, constraining choices like stove for burning lies; workshop micro-setting evolves causally (mist lifts with dawn/clarity). Chameleon's tail as recurring object charges final image, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balancing self-respect/compassion signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening in salve application and notebook addition that narrows options to honest endurance; agency in tending/reporting/request forecloses deceitful path. Cost legible in "accept the public shame"; minor abstractness in wants/needs friction holds it under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing around wounds emerges organically from particulars like scarred tail and shed brochures, reweighting "fragile convictions" via color shifts and notebook lesson without statement. Final image of blue chameleon/trusting tail offers non-literal resonant answer to reconstruction, embracing ambiguity of "growing around the wound."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature in nature-inflected noticing (mist/starlight as emotional analogs); rhythmic modulation accelerates in action beats like poultice circles. No dialogue; purposeful compression of reflection interleaves with micro-choices, paying off in charged final poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and strong verbs drives propulsion; images like "starlight bleeding through like liquid silver" purposeful without muddle. Minor overwriting in tail-tip recurrences borders paraphrase loop but spaced functionally across beats without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con fallout via chameleon healing transforms redemption trope through specific handler details and tail-as-conviction image; risk in quiet, image-led closure heightens stakes organically. No close echoes; particular workshop evolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
