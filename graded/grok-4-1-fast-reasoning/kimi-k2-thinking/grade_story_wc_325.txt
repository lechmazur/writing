<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when claustrophobia tightens but codex compels kneeling in server cradle; endurance earned via prior panic in narrowing corridors, foreclosing easy escape with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to palm-on-terminal sync (seven seconds of witness), delivering Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "tide shifted; water began rising," reconfiguring witness role before ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring phase transitions constrain entry/exit and charge final moon pool burst; water lapping knees in cradle mirrors rising panic, tactilely evolving to force tactical speed on return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness unremembered) tightens via relay room echoes and sync, narrowing to seven-second window under Accumulative lens; agency in "simply remained present" forecloses flight with claustrophobic cost, viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of corporate-erased human residues emerges via gold flecks flaring on colleagues' death sites, resonant in final cable traffic indifference vs. codex fulfillment; non-literal answer reweights invisibility premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "phase transitions were the facility's language"; diction/rhythm modulates from pneumatic sigh to calving glaciers, heightening pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short panic bursts amid lush images); minor metaphor density ("neural pathways," "trapped stars") coheres without muddle, though bulkhead presses repeat slightly dulls one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostprint cables, tidal facility, and codex tracking transforms tech-haunting trope; risk in quantum memory premise pays off inevitably in sync closure, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
