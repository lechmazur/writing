<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to silence father's lies through story-threading is consistent and intensifies via time pressure, compelling the climax speech; interiority concrete in pacing/listening for silence. Contradictory impulses subtle in chasing rest for restless dead while weaving tale. Final endurance of curse via lattice placement earns closure with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (copperlight, hush, lattice) builds to cadence shift at altar speech and chamber seal. Orientation anchored early ("lighthouse prison...son of the boy who cried wolf"). Closure as Charged Poise: lattice glows, hush lives, door seals with cost ("before they find the bodies") legible in final descent and speech.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lattice as recurring object constrains choices (lifts, presses door, altar placement) and charges final image ("lattice glowed, the impossible sustained"). Sensory hierarchy: copper glow/shadows guide descent; scuffs evolve into map/light. Jagged reef/tide pressure outcome via timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chase hush/thread story) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via descent/vibration/speech acceleration under time pressure ("soon they would find the bodies"). Agency in lattice use/speaking forecloses path with felt cost (past silenced, but lighthouse whispers forever). Escalation via pattern break: echoes hover then swallowed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth carving silence from lies emerges via lattice/story-weaving, reweighted in final hush as "living thing" without moralizing. Returning copperlight/hush images shift from repose to eternal chase. Protagonist arc inextricable: inherits curse, sustains impossibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing (echoes/scuffs/lattice whispers); voice texture hypnotic with purposeful repetition (copperlight repose, chasing hush). Rhythmic modulation accelerates in speech beat. No dialogue; elisions (bodies) paid off in timeframe pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long hypnotic sentences build density, shorten in descent/speech); high density integrates motif/action. Minor paraphrase loops on hush/lattice purposeful in accumulative lens, not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peak altar beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wolf myth son in lighthouse prison threads confessional lattice to sustain impossible hush against bodies' discovery. Risky lyric accumulation transforms tropes; final reconfiguration ("hush he chased became the lighthouse's breath") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
