<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's dry wit and subtle confidence drive micro-choices like aligning the feather and stepping onto ice, earning the transformation at climax. Interiority concrete via water imagery, embodied in palm on ice. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but closure choice motivated by prior mapping stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs (condensation, feather, phrasebook) builds to CR closure where Kael becomes source, cost legible in "Kael stepped into the water" as abandonment/transformation. Orientation anchored early (outpost, lake, Kael). Single scene, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain choices (ice walk, crack races back), sensory vivid (ice wind, weeping), charge final image via under-ice currents. POV bias shapes noticing (condensation patterns as cartography). Micro-setting (glass, feather) mirrors internal convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' beginning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via falcon/condensation to convergence on ice, narrowing to step-into-water agency with transformation cost. Pressure coheres texturally, no coincidence resolution. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden sources emerges organically from water motifs shifting to "Nishan" flow, final CR image ("Seven rivers flowed out") reweights beginnings-as-endings-reversed without moral. Subtext in silences (falcon's no message), ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (water writes cartography), rhythmic prose modulates to peak ("ice began to weep"). Muttered dialogue natural/subtle. Voice distinct, no head-hopping, diction fits cartographer's lyric precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax in ice walk; purposeful motif repetition (rivers begin) taught as pattern. Minor loops in "to find where the rivers begin" (-0.4), but accumulative payoff at closure preserves clarity. No artifacts dull ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic cartography and water memory transforms tropes; falcon-through-him risks bold, inevitable in hindsight via convergence motif. No derivatives, specific details (Nishan, dog-ear) anchor vision.</comment>
