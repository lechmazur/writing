<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity excels as pivotal trait, shown in dog-feeding then reporting, complicating survival vs. rebellion; contradictory impulses (grief rebellion vs. informant complicity) act in scene. Final endurance of rituals earns closure choice with cost. Minor label-speak ("morally ambiguous role") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to Charged Poise CR in final image (figurine on sill, bouquet in vase reconfiguring hush as survival canvas) with felt cost of endured grief. Single scene fits scope; dog shard tightens via moral pressure. Orientation anchored early (farmhouse, turbines, mandate).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines and farmhouse constrain choices (report dog for license) and charge final image; bouquet/knife/wood tactile, lived-in via whittling. Sensory hierarchy (hum pressing walls, shavings as confessions) mirrors internal void purposefully. No white-room; spatial coherence clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate lightness in grief) signaled early; accumulative escalation via dog beat forces moral tightening, narrowing options with reporting cost. Agency in endurance/ritual forecloses erasure path. Cost legible in hollow echo persisting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from rituals vs. mandate: lightness carved from grief/void, resonant in CR ending reweighting hush without moralizing. Particulars (shavings, petals, turbines) shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (turbines breathing, blades as scissors); rhythmic prose modulates intensity. Aloud narrations feel goal-driven rebellion. Minor register elevation in metaphors fits poetic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("whittle/narrate" rituals, "lightness in grief," turbines/hush repeated across 4+ beats) and synonym churn (void/echo/hush) dull density, hitting −1.0 total; template cadence in ritual descriptions. Closure image clear despite artifacts. Rhythm varies but overwrites peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mandate's blank faces + turbines' hush + whittling rebellion transforms dystopia via textured survival art; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; particulars (dog bone relic) memorable.</comment>
