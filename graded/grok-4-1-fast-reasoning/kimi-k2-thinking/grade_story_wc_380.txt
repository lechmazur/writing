<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation roots deeply in familial loss, embodied in trembling hands at the ladder and pressing wildflowers to the crystal; micro-choices like coffee-reading and chipping escalate commitment. Interior contradiction subtle in silence after success, earning stasis with cost of Mara's prior emptiness. Mara applies relational pressure via breakfast eyes, clearing at end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: whale's death → gravity pockets → coffee maps piling → chamber entry → exhumation DC with legible cost in fractured crystal and "stumbled upward." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (dock, lamps, whale). Single-shard scope tightens once meaningfully to closure RR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chamber constrains climax choice, gravity pockets alter movement ("steps drag like water"), refracted lilac scent charges memory discovery. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: metallic air, humming facets. Micro-setting (lantern hook, pick) enables entry/exhumation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover Mara's memory) signaled early, escalates causally via coffee deepening to piling/chamber, narrowing options with gravity cost; agency peaks in crystal chipping, foreclosing dissolution path. Visible price: ribs crushed, flakes releasing ghosts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-hoarded memories emerges via whale → crystals → recovery, reweighted in final lanterns "pointing true north" and whale song without moralizing. Wildflowers shift from buried to responsive, charging CR. Complexity in world's cruelty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (gravity tugs as mourning); rhythmic texture modulates ("gleaming silence" motif taught early). Mara's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("violets... you used to pick"), distinct idiom. No head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "chipping... each flake releasing ghost" advances action/atmosphere/emotion). Varied rhythm, no loops; figurative density purposeful in chamber ("time-lapsed glaciers"). Minor density slips pre-climax don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms grief into gravity/memory crystals ingeniously, specifics like coffee grounds and whale bones synthesize fresh; risk in fantastical logic paid off via causal exhumation. Final whale song reconfigures deletion as partial, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
