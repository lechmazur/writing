<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in turning pain to beauty, but lacks concrete interior contradiction or embodied micro-choices under pressure; abstract endurance feels told rather than dramatized in pivotal singing beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from nightly verses to blooming armistice; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with fragility cost legible in "petal peace that could be crushed by a single storm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell anchors and constrains song-echoing choices; selective sensory details like "conch walls" and "off-key wind" integrate purposefully, charging final cathedral image without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging armistice escalates accumulatively via merfolk softening and spears laid down; one deepening in blossoms as treaty narrows war options, but cost remains somewhat abstract beyond fragility nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of photosynthesizing pain emerges organically from songs to blossoms; resonant final image of "cathedral of peace" reweights longing without moralizing, though repetition borders on redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in star-counting and nebula swirls; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, though minor syntactic repetition undercuts peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "half-sung lullabies," "reef-shadow joy," "centuries of longing") across final third dull propulsion and obscure closure image; high figurative density without pattern payoff triggers overwriting penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-merfolk armistice via lullabies transforms sea-war trope; shyly unstoppable persistence feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking lyric repetition heightening stakes.</comment>
