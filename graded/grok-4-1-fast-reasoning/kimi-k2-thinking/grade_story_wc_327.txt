<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to translate texture into sound compels choices from diamond press to bird channeling; embodied in copper veins resonating. Internal limits drive failure without tidy epiphany, but contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneous in summit realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ascent to diamond's song; CR closure reconfigures failure as persistence in "diamond continued its quiet recitation," with cost of isolation and death legible. One tightening via bird syntax maps onto fracture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's "polished calcium" constrains diamond press and amplifies birth of words; spinebirds' geometry charges final elegy. Sensory hierarchy (texture via veins, fossilized thunder taste) biases POV selectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens via bird patterns foreclosing sensation-only path; agency in consciousness extension narrows to unintelligible success with language-death cost in "final breath spent."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of persistence beyond meaning emerges via particulars; final image of diamond "sang endlessly to itself" reweights curse as gift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in texture-sound translation ("grinding glaciers, like roots breaking stone"); rhythmic control modulates from quiet ascent to trembling climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but minor paraphrase loop in ending ("sang...recitation...voice") slightly dulls final image without obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bird-flock syntax mapped to diamond fracture synthesizes fresh angle on translation; risk in lyric accumulative mode heightens closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
