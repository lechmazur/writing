<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's frugality and empiricism root motivation consistently, compelling micro-choices like mapping against star charts; contradictory impulses peak in eighth-night irony where rationality unveils "supernatural"; minor telling of traits like "stubborn patience" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds over nights to pattern break at schematic completion; on-page CR closure via tile vanishing disperses knowledge with conceptual cost legible in "its knowledge dispersed into starlight"; orientation anchored early in palace observatory between regimes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via moonlight triggering tile warmth and courtyard activation space; sensory hierarchy (astronomer's chalk, stylus scratch, thermal variations) filters through POV; recurring tile-as-micro-setting charges final vanishing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode/seal before new priests signaled early, tightens via eighth-night irony narrowing to portal pattern; agency in schematic tracing forecloses empirical doubt with cost in tile's disappearance; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns persisting beyond regimes emerges via tile's numerology mirroring stars; final image of papyri outliving frugality offers resonant CR repricing devotion as "acknowledgement" without moral; subtext in irony avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in schematic/geometric noticing; rhythmic modulation builds dusky texture without drift; no dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression of nights maintains voice coherence to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in mapping beats ("grid upon grid," "night after night") and figurative density in climax ("cold, then hot, then vanished") slightly dull peak rhythm; no scaffold or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian magic square as empirical cipher to cosmic patterns transforms trope; risk in Accumulative night-build to CR closure heightens stakes; irreplaceable tile-star map overlay feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
