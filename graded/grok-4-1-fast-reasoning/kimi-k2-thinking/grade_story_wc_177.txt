<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via vine-tracing and dream-swallowing; contradictory impulses (preserve vs. transcend) act in the recursive dream loop, earning the climb-out choice with embodied cost (mortar dust, brittle nail).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (vines, fox, directive) breaks via dream revelation, yielding CR closure in emergence and bunker collapse with legible cost (stamp falls into loam, foreclosing bunker path).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines and concrete constrain climb-out choice and charge final image (rain rivulets, forest as living library); sensory selection (thunder shaking mortar, condensation spirals) mirrors internal patterns purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode directive's why) signaled early, tightens via sharp dream reversal changing knowledge/options; agency in interpretation forces transcendence with on-page cost (bunker sighs last).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-breaking emerges organically from vine/directive motifs shifting at dream ("directive decays by design"); final image reweights preservation premise without moralizing, resonant via walker's choice to become wilderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (reading timelines in vines/shadows); rhythmic diction modulates from dreamlight haze to storm transcendence, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor figurative overload ("green thread," "rearview mirror") in opening risks coherence without fully dulling propulsion; closure image clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of foresight-as-hindsight constraint into transcendence via recursive dream; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens pattern-break stakes organically.</comment>
