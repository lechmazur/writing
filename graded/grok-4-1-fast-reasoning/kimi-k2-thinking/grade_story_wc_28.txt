<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arin's contradictory impulses (frost/flame heart) act in scene via embodied cold gnawing bones against flickering warmth, earning the renaming choice with felt burden of remembrance. Strengths in micro-choices like cupping tessera and carving reveal values hierarchy. Minor slips in label-speak ("gentle radical") slightly abstract motivation without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and images builds to Charged Poise closure in naming "Plaza of Embers" and walking away, reconfiguring ruins' meaning with legible cost in "weight of empathy." Orientation anchored early (Arin in plaza post-fire). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shattered sky and ash-spiced air selectively filter through Arin's bias, mirroring internal warm/cold states; mosaic stepping stone constrains carving choice and charges final image as "cornerstone." Sensory hierarchy urgent, integrated into action. No white-room; vivid, purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor aberrant mercy via renaming) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory deepening (soldier flashback) to carving turn narrowing options with endurance cost in steel-armed empathy. Protagonist agency in tracing/carving; visible price in "burden of remembrance" alters final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><grade><comment>Theme of mercy/empathy in ruin emerges organically from tessera handling and naming, with soldier memory as pivotal image shifting to aberrant beauty; final plaza breathing offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids overt morals but repetitive echoes ("arms of steel") blunt ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mosaic/fire motifs; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged at carving. Purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits introspective radical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Massive paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("mosaic stepping stone," "arms of steel," "shattered sky") repeat naming/mercy across 10+ lines, dulling closure image and obscuring propulsion. Template cadence in repetitive legacy affirmations; overwrought metaphors consistent but dense without payoff. High-pressure naming beat suffers −1.0 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire remembrance via tessera-carving renames ruins poetically, transforming tropes with retrocognitive texture. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Minor template feel from prompt elements slightly hedges boldness.</comment>
