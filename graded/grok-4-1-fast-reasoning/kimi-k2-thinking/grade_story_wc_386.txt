<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to salvage pure memory clear and consistent, embodied in gloved hands and breath mist; however, repeated "weaving truth carefully" phrasing flattens interior specificity and lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via motif density (starlight, windows), holds to CR closure in "Maya woke with the globe in her palms"—reconfigures one-way ghost aid to reciprocal gift with felt cost of her lifelong solitary dives; orientation anchored by ~100 words, single-shard scope fits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (silver mist breath, ice cracking like glass) with glacier shrine and wreck constraining path (frozen altar to rusted door); recurring globes as micro-setting charge final image, mirroring internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage pure memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream fragments to ghost-guided discovery; agency in prying door forecloses ignorance with physical cost (ice crack), legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fragile connections theme emerges organically from dream cameos, glyphs, dual globes shifting to two-way exchange; final dream image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (ghost flickers, warped glass); motif repetition voice-motivated but borders monotony; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Patterned motifs ("borrowed starlight" ~7 recurrences, "weaving truth carefully" 4x) create paraphrase loops and template cadence, dulling discovery beat ("inside found...pristine snow globe"); density high but overwrites propulsion in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh ghost-whisperer wreck-diver premise transformed via dream analysis and lullaby payoff; poetic motif synthesis feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
