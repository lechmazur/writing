<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters archetypal without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; oracle's mild obsession shown in gaze but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure. Traveler's acceptance lacks embodied conflict or internal stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build of silence motifs to CR closure in "silence itself had become a story," cost felt in endless night embrace; orientation anchored early in fort/shore/star.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: storm-tossed fort and pebble shore constrain isolation, charge final image where fort fades as "silent sentinel"; sensory hush integrates with action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map for endless night) signaled early but escalation mild—textural deepening via silence density, yet lacks visceral trade-off narrowing options; closure cost conceptual but legible in traveler's step forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language/compass emerges organically from particulars like booklet's dust and map's glow; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct poetic texture in rhythmic hush repetitions taught early; perceptual bias toward silence patterns consistent, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "hush"/silence motifs purposeful and taught, but paraphrase loops like repeated "ambered hush" and "flaking gold leaf" across beats dull propulsion in mid-section without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope via silence-map transforms mystic quest; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
