<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's empathetic decisiveness drives consistent micro-choices like gathering phrases, compelling higher-stakes community action; interiority concrete in feeling rhythms and silences. Minor flaw: brief diagnostic phrasing like "empathetically decisive" slightly abstracts embodiment at inciting climb, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shards gather voices toward RR closure in clock's multilingual song and town glow, with felt cost in Elara's heavy satchel and heard silences. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara, tower, elevators); mosaic pattern taught early via spiral climbs and elevator visits. Brass weight placement decisive, reconfiguring silos into harmony without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent starlight and brass weight constrain choices (climb, placement) and charge final festival image; elevators' linguistic hums filter through Elara's choral bias, vivid and tactile. Silos lean inward at climax, mirroring internal harmony without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge silos via song) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via phrase-gathering to collective choir, narrowing to clock activation with visible cost in rehabilitating silences. Festival crystallizes agency, but lacks one deeper reversal beyond density build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of voices bridging divides emerges from interspersed phrases and clock's song, reweighting silos as harmonious corn rows in final image without moralizing. Resonance in elders weeping and children mispronouncing, charging closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in musical rhythms (e.g., "rhythm become a countermelody"); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic across languages, advancing harmony. Rhythmic control peaks in chorus rise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm (starlight refrain bookends cleanly); minor paraphrase loops in "harmony" repetitions purposeful for textural build, not scaffold. Slight overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., gears exhaling) at weight placement, but doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic elevators and multilingual cuckoo transforms community trope; risk in mosaic voices heightens stakes, inevitable in clock's song repricing silos as bridged.</comment>
