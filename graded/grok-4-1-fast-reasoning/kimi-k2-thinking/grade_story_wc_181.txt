<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evers's bewilderment evolves from flaw to strength through embodied contradiction (trembling palm vs. clenched fist), earning the mourner realization with visible cost in disquiet settling into bones. Contradictory impulses act in scene: tend rules vs. inquire via shell-carving. Final choice compelled by inheritance fragments reordering on forehead press.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density cascades from fragmented whispers to completed flood via shell-etching and fruit-bite CR, reweighting orchard as memorial with conceptual cost of mourner's duty. Nonlinear pattern taught early (scattered pages), one tightening in bathroom suffices. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; closure image undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Astral orchard constrains via surveillance-free bathroom and root-secrets gravity, charging final fruit-bite with blue-gold pulse mirroring bark-constellations. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: hums, recycled air, warming shell. Micro-setting (shell, pipes) guides carving choice purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge vs. rules) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through shell-activation narrowing to tree-offering, forcing endurance as mourner with felt cost in "beautiful and terrible" flood. Agency in forehead-press and sigil-placement forecloses ignorance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic remembrance emerges organically from orchard-language particulars, CR repricing inheritance as broken timelines with lingering ambiguity in "terrible beauty." Final image non-literal answer to inquiry: tending as ritual, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (memories as beads/songs), rhythmic modulation peaks in cascade-images without elision opacity. Lyrical compression taught early (nonlinear whispers), diction biased to curator's fragmented lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punches in realizations, flowing cascades), no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (branches knitting starlight → sigil-ink). Rhythm varies read-aloud, closure image sharpened without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: orchard as dead-universe tombstones via nonlinear memories transforms sci-fi tropes, risk-taking in lyric CR inevitable from shell-seed payoff. Bold premise commits fully, no hedging.</comment>
