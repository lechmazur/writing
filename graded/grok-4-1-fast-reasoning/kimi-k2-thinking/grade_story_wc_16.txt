<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and conflicted, with embodied caution in the "cautiously exuberance" wait and micro-choice to write despite fear; Kess's late entry applies relational pressure effectively. Final reconciliation earns change via prior silence and gamble. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: writing-sending-waiting-reply-meeting accumulates to Charged Poise closure in shared writing/laughing amid sealing, with cost in diverging paths felt in "futures waited on separate roads." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via 20-hour wait-reply narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive shelves, pneumatic tube, and ink well constrain choices (deadline seals access) and charge final image of empty well packed as reminder. Sensory hum of symphonies filters through Elara's linguist bias; details evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via countdown and reply forcing meeting choice; agency in sending promises forecloses silence path with relational cost legible in Kess's "afraid you were right." No reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resurrected truth via dead languages emerges organically from promises chain to shared lexicon; final image of symphonies "traveling with them" reweights premise non-literally with divergence cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in magic lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Elara with perceptual signature in linguistic patterns ("symphonies humming"); brief Kess dialogue natural/subtextual. Lyrical rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("trapped starlight") borders overwriting in setup but pattern-taught and purposeful; no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics-magic binds promises to reality-alteration, transforming reconciliation trope via Jorvik phonemes; risk in "carefully reckless" gamble heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
