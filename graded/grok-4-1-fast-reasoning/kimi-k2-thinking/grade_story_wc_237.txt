<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to transform scars into stories drives micro-choices like whispering superstitions amid trembling hands; embodied anxiety peaks concretely when ink crystallizes. Internal conflict between grief and ritual shows in fractured sigil then tear-offering pivot. Earned change lands at exhale, releasing old self with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hushed anticipation to crystalline rune completion as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored early (Kaelin on floating rock edge). Closure cost legible in "weight of her past lifting" and exhaled old self against breaking storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock and tea platform constrain ritual, pulsing to acknowledge transformation and glowing as talisman. Sensory hush, swirling clouds, crystallizing ink filter through Kaelin's anxious priorities. Platform charges final image as "vessel of stories," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scars-to-stories) signaled early, deepens via ink fracture then tear resolution under accumulative lens. Agency in deliberate tracing and superstition-calmed persistence forecloses fear-path. Cost unmistakable in crystallized grief-shards and released past self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from rune-etching scars, shifting crystals as pain-to-light narrative. Final drifting rock reweights motif with non-literal resonance: "each scar would become a rune." Avoids morals via imaged transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV distance with perceptual bias toward breath-hush textures; voice poetic and consistent. Rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise without head-hopping. Minor repetition erodes distinctness in reflective stretches.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("saturated hush" x4, "held breath" motifs redundant across beats) and synonym churn (crystals as "tiny shards," "beacon," "facet" without propulsion) dull peak rune-tracing. Template cadence in repetitive quill descriptions obscures closure image. Density low amid overwriting in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune-scholar ritual on drifting tea-platform amid storm-hush transforms scar trope into luminous, feather-carried release. Risky lyric compression heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
