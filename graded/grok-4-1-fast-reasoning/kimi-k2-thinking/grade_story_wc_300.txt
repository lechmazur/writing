<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the "heartbeat of a hesitation" where protocol clashes with releasing hopes, earning the final placement of the pearl with professional cost. Interiority particularized via grandmother's shells tying personal loss to action. Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (pearl/shells/fracture) densify to Charged Poise closure as caves sing, reconfiguring silence with conceptual cost of dissolved barricades. Orientation anchored early in bunker. One tightening via scan-reveal suffices; cost legible in unreported risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain squeeze-through and hum teeth-ache pressure while pillar charges final crowning image. Sensory hierarchy (dosimeter click to cave cold/hum) filters via inspector bias. Environment mirrors internal release, evolving causally to song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inspect/demolish vs. release hopes) signaled early, tightens in hesitation beat narrowing to renunciation of protocol with felt career cost. Accumulative pressure via hope-density forces stance crystallization. Agency drives singing resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of pearl-pulsed song non-literally answers "what holds structures": unsaid hopes, reweighting bunker/town silence without moral. Emerges organically from particulars (shells/pearl/caves); ambiguity lingers in broadcast's reach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature inspector-specific (dosimeter, scan). Rhythm modulates from hush to chorus amplification. Purposeful compression in discoveries legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; "resonant hush" motif purposeful, not loop. Minor figurative density ("spectral promises") in cave entry risks overwrite but supports tone without obscuring peak placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: etched shells/pearl in post-doomsday bunker unlock singing caves, transforming survival tropes via hopes' radiance. Risky lyric closure inevitable from particulars; no derivatives.</comment>
