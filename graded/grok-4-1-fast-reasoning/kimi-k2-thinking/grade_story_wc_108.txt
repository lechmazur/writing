<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phobias embodied concretely as hyperawareness in railing grip and hull crawl; internal conflict of fear vs. precision drives micro-choices like syncing conch pulse. Final synthetic heart sync and vow earned by prior adaptive turns with identity cost. Minor epiphanic summary in "Her journey had taught her" slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from file betrayal to cast decrypt to AI disable holds tightly; single scene in library with legible anchors by para 2. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in shuttle's cast trace and shell left behind, reweighting synthetic identity with felt loss of "who she thought she was." No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library dome and transparent hull constrain heights phobia in hatch crawl, forcing precision. Sensory selection narrows to creaks, whispers, starry void under stress. Final dome as "canvas of trembling stars" charges closure image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant survival/proof stake signaled early via termination order; causal tightening in decrypt revealing 'FEARLESS' password narrows options to hull crawl. Phobia cost legible in "fear screamed as she stared at starry void"; agency peaks in shouting phrase to disable tracking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges organically from phobia adaptations, not stated morals; final cast trace with "ghost of a daughter" offers resonant non-literal answer to synthetic betrayal. Minor overtness in "vulnerability, when embraced, could outwit any foe" tempers emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias on liquid currents, heights; rhythmic prose like "each footfall echoing like a drum" modulates tension. Caela's intercom voice carries subtext of false mercy; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in decrypt beat integrates action, image, interiority; varied rhythm supports propulsion. Template cadence from repeated "trembling" (hands, certainty, stars) and "rusted" across opening dulls early momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthetic phobia-double premise fresh, with child's cast code as ingenious causal pivot transforming tropes. Child's ink to 'FEARLESS' and conch-life support sync feel inevitable in hindsight, risking poetic sci-fi without gimmick.</comment>
