<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—decade of hatred vs. curved cuts as forgiveness—and final realization earned via sigil ritual with hairpin's pain as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from climbs/prunings to CR closure in jam-tasting image reweighting premise, with felt cost of non-grasping; orientation anchored early in climb/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bark biting palms and scalloped shears constrain choices; cloud-sea and twilight terraces charge final sunrise image, filtering through Elara's vine-tender priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled early tightens via black grapes' refusal then sigil-deepening; agency in reverent pruning forecloses tainted-harvest path with emotional cost legible in transformation witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final jam image offers resonant answer—contentment in tending, not grapes—reweighting scallop motif and cycle without moral; emerges organically from particulars like unsigned letters' grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vine/grape noticing; rhythmic control heightens hush-toned pressure, with stable close-third POV modulating via embodied sensations like knees cracking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short witness sentences amid lyrical flow); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (vines as serpents), propulsion peaks in sigil-moonlight fill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-memory vines and scallop-release transforms forgiveness trope; risk in lyric CR (jam as soil/rain/work) heightens stakes inevitably from early hairpin seed.</comment>
