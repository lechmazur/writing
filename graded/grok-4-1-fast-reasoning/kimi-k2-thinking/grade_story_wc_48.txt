<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between cynicism and softness acts in witnessing cameos like the burned soldier's lullaby; final release earned with embodied lightness ("feeling lighter than he has in decades"). Micro-choices like breathing into shell reveal values under pressure. Minor over-articulation of epiphanies borders diagnostic but anchors to concrete cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of cameos builds to shell-crack RR/CR, reweighting endings as "doors left ajar" with conceptual cost of accepting unfinished hopes. Orientation anchored early (novelist at nexus with shell). Closure cost legible in "conflict resolved" and empty hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell as micro-setting handled tactilely (pulses, pressed to lips/earth, cracks), constraining choices and charging final image as "monument." Mist/ink sensory details mirror internal fog purposefully, selective to urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect/solemnize hopes) signaled early, tightens via accumulating cameos deepening cynicism's cost; agency in nods/touches forecloses hardened craft. Lens escalation: density reweights to release. Cost unmistakable in clipped wings felt and lightness post-release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings as nexuses emerges organically from particulars like dissolving girl and younger self; final image ("chooses to begin") offers resonant CR reweighting failures as seeds without moral. No overt statements; ambiguity lingers in ajar doors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (lucid watchfulness biases to shapes/hopes); lyrical rhythm modulates from watchful to hushed, purposeful for surreal. Compression taught early, legible at shell release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies for hush build. Minor paraphrase loops in cameo descriptions ("dissolves," "whispering") but pattern-taught, not obscuring closure. No artifacts in peak shell-crack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writerly regrets as feral nexus cameos transforms ghostly trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of softness vs. cynicism, inevitable in shell-seed image. Bold surreal frame commits fully.</comment>
