<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's contradictory impulses—equations vs. shell's voice—act simultaneously until pivotal surrender ("stopped translating and simply felt"), earning change with embodied cost (vibrations through ribs); no safety-hedging, flaws complicate independence. Minor abstract diagnostic slips ("terrifying paradox") don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from skepticism to reconfiguration; on-page CR ("ghostly resolve had become her own") with conceptual cost (isolation dissolved into bridge); orientation anchored instantly ("velvet garden at twilight"); single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains choices (petals brush reproachfully, flowers release echoes) and charges final image (dawn holds both); sensory hierarchy via POV (moss defies equations); body/setting tactile (kneels among petals). Micro-setting as pivotal crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive before dawn) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening density (shell voice fragments to clear message) narrows options; agency in release forecloses rational path with felt cost ("surrender her equations"); star fade tightens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (independence as connection) emerges organically from quarantine-as-cocoon shift, final image ("bridge crossed") reweights premise non-literally; earned via particulars, no moralizing. Minor redundancy in "radiant" echoes slightly dilutes without harming closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (scientific lens on magic: "phosphorescent moss that shouldn't exist"); rhythmic modulation peaks at closure ("words came not from thought but..."); no dialogue, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels accumulative texture, varied rhythm supports lyric ear-test; minor overwrite penalty for figurative density in peak ("membrane between worlds... cocoon") without muddle, and "resonance structures" motif repetition (purposeful, no loop). Slight paraphrase in independence motifs drags momentum pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific skepticism and magical resonance (shell as consciousness bridge) transforms tropes organically; bold lyric risk heightens emotional stakes; irreplaceable premise inflections feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
