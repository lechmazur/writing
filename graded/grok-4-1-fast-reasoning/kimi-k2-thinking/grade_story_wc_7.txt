<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to create beauty from ruins intensifies through tasting vine memories, grounding her resolve in embodied specifics. Interiority shines in sensory tasting but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, smoothing internal conflict. No pivotal flaw touches closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pruning to alignment peak to fruit tasting, yielding Charged Poise closure where rebellion reconfigures decay into renewal. Cost legible in "gentle rebellion had borne fruit" line, foreclosing silence with on-page success. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted ribs "bleeding orange" and silver light constrain pruning/planting choices and charge final breathing greenhouse image. Sensory hierarchy (taste-dominant via memories) reflects chef POV bias perfectly. Atmosphere tensions decay/renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock seed vs. Order's silence) signaled early; tightening via alignment peak forces growth under Accumulative lens, narrowing to success with felt defiance cost. Pruning outlaw risk alters tactics; agency in micro-choices coheres pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from ruins emerges organically via seed-to-fruit arc, synaptic metaphors shifting to "turning rust into bloom" without statement. Final image reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of shared seeds. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with chef's perceptual signature in tasting/filtered senses; voice modulates poetically from thick air to lingering sweetness. Rhythmic prose reflects informal wisdom without head-hopping or withholding. Experimental lyric compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., pruning reveals memories/resolve); rhythm varies for cosmic hum peak. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("ghost of chlorophyll," "memory of rain") risks muddle but patterns taught early; "informal wisdom" paraphrase loop dings once (-0.4). Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synergy of memory-tasting chef, synaptic plants, cosmic alignment transforms ruin tropes into fresh synthesis of rebellion-as-cultivation. Risky conceit (plants rewiring like neurons) inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via forbidden acts. Final whisper recharges premise boldly.</comment>
