<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's methodical curiosity and empathy drive consistent micro-choices like frame-by-frame video alignment and gentle door push, earning her final tempered openness. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. respect for silence) act simultaneously in the chapel entry beat. Minor abstractness in emotions ("quiet openness blooming") slightly under-embodies peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map tear to video comparison to seam detection, culminating in CR closure where tear reconfigures as "invitation" with cost of quiet documentation. Orientation anchors early (studio, map framer, henge site). One tightening via anomaly detection narrows options perfectly for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault and weathered stones constrain choices (hides/reveals door via push) and charge final image (fresco "remains, its whispers now heard"). Sensory details (parchment scent, cool stone palm-press) filter through Elena's tactile priorities. No generic placeholders; all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret chapel silence) escalates accumulatively via video deepening to seam reveal, forcing empathetic stance crystallization at entry. Agency in comparisons forecloses ignorance path with felt cost (silence "tempered by deep empathy"). Minor abstract stakes declaration early slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (unknown known through listening) emerges organically from tear motif shifting to silver thread bridge, offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Final image reweights silence from erasure to "canvas of forgotten stories." Complexity in guarded respect avoids tidy platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature: silences, textures, empathy bias (e.g., "each crack a voice hushed by time"). Rhythm modulates from methodical to charged poise at "silence to speak." No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful lyric repetition (silence, rain-scoured) accumulates texture without loops obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase in adjacent "methodical curiosity" drives (−0.4). Propulsion clear, no artifacts dulling chapel image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: map tear as portal via silent videos transforms lost-site trope into empathetic silence-listening. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; particular details (silver thread) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
