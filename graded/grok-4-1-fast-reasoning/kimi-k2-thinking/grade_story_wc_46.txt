<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to share light roots consistently in star-watching memories and polishing micro-choice; embodied emotion in "tiny heft that whispered of tides" reveals contradiction between sky-pull and earth-rootedness without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in village square placement, reweighting earthbound limits with shared glow cost felt in her "quiet mission"; orientation anchored early in grotto entry; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto mist and wet sand constrain discovery/polishing choices; sea glass as micro-setting charges final constellation image, filtered through Mira's light-obsessed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light deepens accumulatively via polishing but lacks reversal narrowing options or visible trade-off; serene progression yields low pressure with abstract rather than visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reflective stillness emerges organically from glass polishing to village glow without moralizing; final image reweights earth-sky divide non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature on lights/reflections; rhythmic modulation suits meditative texture without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("pearl of stillness" x6, grotto refrain x3) and synonym churn in extended ending dull closure image density; final-third artifacts cap propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea glass as starlight vessel transforms earthbound trope into fresh alchemy; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
