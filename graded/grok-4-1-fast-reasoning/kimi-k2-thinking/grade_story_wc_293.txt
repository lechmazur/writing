<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt possibility consistently drives micro-choices like decoding flutters and descending to grove; interiority embodied in trembling fingers and sharpened senses under stress. Final endurance of playing new song feels earned by prior observations. Minor weakness: abstract phrasing like "pixelated amnesty" slightly detaches from concrete contradiction in impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motif density (flutters, glass flake) builds to Charged Poise closure when fiddler plays new bridge-song, reconfiguring "never" into possibility with legible emotional cost in "weight of the past lift." Orientation anchored early at pullout post-vanish. Single scene with spatial progression fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scaffold flutters and grove cairn constrain choices by mapping secret location and yielding tin box, charging final image. Sensory details (pine air, moonlight patches) selective via POV's observant bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear from pullout descent to center cairn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt possibility) signaled early, escalates texturally via insistent flutters urging descent and photo discovery narrowing to new melody. Agency in following map forecloses inaction with felt cost of confronting past via tin box find. One tightening sufficient under lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of amnesty from "never" emerges organically via shifting glass flake image and final melody weaving hitchhiker memory, offering non-literal resonant answer in "ashes of 'never' now a fertile ground." Avoids moralizing; complexity in luminous disbelief lingers. Recurring motifs constrain without checklist feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of mystical observation (e.g., "pixelated amnesty etched"); rhythmic prose modulates from mournful to hopeful. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under textural lens. Capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" exact thrice, flutters in 8+ variants with synonym churn) create template cadence, dulling peak descent momentum (-1.2). Dense figuration borders coherence strain (e.g., "pixelated" world early); density high but scaffold drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler ghost tale with Morse scaffold and wet-plate flake transforms tropes via textural map to conceptual repricing. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically; no template echoes or hedging.</comment>
