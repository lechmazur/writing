<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance creates embodied internal conflict ("tugged at her chest") and contradictory impulses acting in murals despite corporate presence. Micro-choices like encoding ciphers reveal values with cost (betrayal risk). Final determination earned via successive actions; no second character limits relational pressure but fits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: murals layer density toward Charged Poise closure ("community...ready to adapt"; cost in "battle...not over"). Orientation anchored early (carnival/raft city/Mira). One tightening via storm testing graffiti suffices; no shard excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stone chip constrains (pocket/thigh/palm) and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (paint turpentine/hope, rain washing lines) reflects Mira's pattern-seeing bias. Raft decay mirrors stakes, evolved by storm/agents without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reorganize via graffiti) signaled early, tightens accumulatively: murals → child glance → final phoenix map before agents. Agency in painting forecloses open speech; cost legible in storm erasure risk and fragile roots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of chaotic resistance emerges via graffiti layers shifting from cipher to phoenix map, reweighting dual allegiance without statement. Final phoenix/stone image offers non-literal answer (adaptation over crumble). Complexity in coexistence ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in "swirl of costumes," graffiti code). Prose texture modulates rhythmically (short storm sentences vs. flowing murals); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "paint smelled of turpentine and hope" advances sense/theme). Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwrite in metaphors ("fireflies on a liquid sky") but coherent, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Graffiti-as-code in raft carnival transforms resistance trope organically. Stone chip/phoenix synthesis feels inevitable; bold accumulative structure risks poetic density but heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
