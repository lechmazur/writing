<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, e.g., "Time pressed against my ribs like a second heartbeat," with contradictory impulses in false starts compelling the final clever choice; motivation rooted in family legacy earns the renunciation of force for recording. Minor slip in abstract phrasing of "capture the sound of trust breaking" but doesn't flatten peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from false starts to fob discovery and rewiring, tightening via pattern break into successful recording; on-page closure as Charged Poise with conceptual cost in carrying "the captured sound," truce reconfigured intact. Orientation anchored early in pier/market; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pier's "splintered boards" and "ancient support beam" constrain choices, unlocking compartment via fob to charge final image; sensory selection (whispers, slick timbers) reflects POV urgency without catalog. Atmosphere mirrors brittle trust, evolving causally to sunrise blush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect hush truce) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed force attempts narrowing to recording agency; tightening forecloses brute options with time cost to sunrise legible in "counting down the minutes." Stranger's betrayal tests commitment on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of measurable trust emerges implicitly from sound motifs shifting to "trust, once broken, can be measured in the smallest of sounds"; final fob tick reweights hush without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing (e.g., "whisper of corked bottles"); lyrical voice modulates rhythm under pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge; diction consistent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in action beats; minor figurative density (e.g., stacked similes like "forgotten promise," "splintering mast") in opening without obscuring closure, but paraphrase echoes of "silence/hush" drag slightly. No loops or scaffolds touch peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate hush economy with sonic betrayal capture via fob/recorder; transforms tropes through fob's mechanical poetry, risk in lyric texture heightens stakes organically. No close template echoes.</comment>
