<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to honor overlooked histories drives concrete micro-choices like knotting her hair into the moth wing, revealing interior contradiction between transient presence and permanent memory-shaping; embodied loss in "mathematics of loss" feels particular, earning her endurance at the tower's crown without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds from cairns/prayer flags to moth wing's tethering, culminating in Charged Poise CR: monarch carries signal into emptiness with impermanence cost legible in "tower would collapse by winter"; orientation anchored in opening grotto/migration setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Verdant grotto's height/isolation constrains signals (e.g., "driftwood ladders that dissolved"), charging final image as monarch "struggled upward"; sensory bias (moss spores, cloud-condensed crystals) mirrors Esme's priorities without catalog, evolving with "steamed with respiration."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring lost flyways) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via wing discovery forcing final signal escalation; agency in 47-degree angle calculation forecloses permanence with felt cost in "shaped absence," though abstract scale slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanent memory emerges organically from knotted wing and dissolving structures, resonating in final CR image where monarch completes "interrupted cadence" without moralizing; subtext in "syntax of absence speaking to ghosts" reweights particulars non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in mathematical/ecological idiom ("each extinct pollinator erased seventeen plant memories"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "wing caught the wind, vibrated... sang," teaching poetic compression early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence, but patterned repetition ("temporary structures as signals," "blushing stillness") borders paraphrase loop in reflective beats, slightly dulling momentum without obscuring wing-harp climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Esoteric realist's signal-building transforms extinction trope into fresh "shaped absence" synthesis, risking lyric density that heightens stakes; "flyway maps from her grandmother's journals" inflects hindsight inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
