<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sylvar's guardian traits and purpose drive consistent actions to the climax placement of hand on rune; Vael provides secondary pressure as pretender. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with causal linkages from ink inscriptions to Vael tracing spiral to glamour fraying and final sundering as DC with legible cost ("pretensions laid bare"); accumulative/textural lens holds from setup through charged final image. Orientation anchored early in library and Sylvar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library setting with vines, dust, collapsing stones constrains via tomes for messages and charges closure sigh/exhale; sensory details (yellowed pages, glowing rune) filter through Sylvar's eternal vigil, mirroring unraveling illusions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unmask pretender signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Vael unlocking riddle (knowledge deepening), fraying glamour narrowing options to Sylvar's willful sunder with visible cost; coherent pressure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth unmasking illusion emerges organically from rune sundering glamour and final echo of uncovered truth; resonant non-literal closure image of rune fading reweights pretender's hollow heart without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (eternal time as "slow lung," stars as "dandelion seeds"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity to charged poise at shattering illusion, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through metaphors taught early as lyric pattern; minor loop in "graceful collapse" repeated without obscuring cause/effect, climax metaphors ("shattering like glass struck by divine hammer") cohere despite density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of ink puzzles unraveling glamour via rune transforms pretender trope; fresh angle on library as active witness (sighing stones) with risk-taking poetic compression heightening eternal stakes.</comment>
