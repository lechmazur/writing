<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory drive vs. fear acts in crafting the shell whistle from the crack-map, earning the closure carving with conceptual cost of embracing silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern density deepens to revelation ("voice... entered her mind"), landing CR closure in carving image with cost of foreclosed return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle shells constrain mapping choices and charge final carving image, with calcium swirls mirroring internal patterns through cartographer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to question watchers deepens accumulatively via crack-decoding to whistle-blow reversal, crystallizing stance in carving with felt cost of shaped dread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final carving offers resonant answer to curiosity's death, reweighting spirals from history to questions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of pattern-language biases noticing ("calcium geometries that recorded time"), rhythmic control heightens revelation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm propels from "three heartbeats" tension to shell creak; purposeful spiral motifs avoid muddle, minor figurative density purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Turtles-as-maps and watchers-as-historians synthesize boldly into CR of questions-as-gate, risk heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
