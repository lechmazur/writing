<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete micro-choices like painting sigils and breathing stillness, revealing character-particular gift for patterns; motivation intensifies through ritual alignment without unearned epiphanies. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax capture, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from watchful vigil to spasming thread and capture (DC/RR as Charged Poise), with legible cost in dissolving thread and void's swallow; single scene coheres perfectly, orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora's pulsing bands and crystal edge to void constrain alignment choice and charge final emerald placement; selective sensory hierarchy (light as static Morse, warming palm) filters through POV expertise. Micro-setting of emerald as tool elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early tightens via thread's fray/spasm and droplet formation under accumulative lens, narrowing to breath-coaxed infusion with agency; cost legible in snapped thread, charging poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stealing ephemera from oblivion emerges organically via photon-rendered couplet and eternal jasmine bloom; final image reweights preservation's defiance non-literally, with lingering ambiguity in indifferent aurora.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of cosmic frequencies and sigil gestures; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to blaze, reflecting lucid mind under ritual stress; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "green mouth drinking starlight") without loops, muddled metaphors, or scaffold; varied syntax propels to closure whisper, passing 9+ zero-artifact test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual with cosmic soul-capture transforms death tropes via star-mined chip and static patterns; risk in lyric sci-fantasy frame heightens stakes, inevitable in emerald's swirl.</comment>
