<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Guard's motivation to shepherd memory intensifies through embodied singing to throat-cracking, earning dissolution; strength in micro-choice hierarchy revealed in planting the archive despite personal compression. Minor weakness: internal conflict more declarative than simultaneous impulses in the null-zone beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from static clock to null-zone cancer to backward-potential ripple; CR closure lands with conceptual cost in "guard watched, occasionally everywhere and now finally nowhere." Orientation anchored early via freight guard in waste post-forest burn; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains travel and planting site, charging final image as it "grew legs and walked"; quantum foam, sand-as-chlorophyll filter through guard's perceptual bias. Recurrent unlit corners evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (root archive against null-zone) signaled early, escalates via deepening cancer image forcing charm-song trade-off; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights with felt cost in throat bleeding during climax. Agency in braiding probabilities forecloses scattering path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-from-ash emerges organically via sparks/possibilities; final downward forest image offers resonant CR answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Lullaby motif shifts from coherence-guard to fractured echo, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in quantum-biased noticing (e.g., "ripples in the quantum foam"); rhythmic control modulates from static charge to unbearable light under pressure. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chess clock ticked forward one second...null-zone flickered"); rhythmic variety supports propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during bloom beat (butter/sun) risks coherence, but pattern-consistent and closure-charged; no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Quantum-post-apoc synthesis with downward-star-rooted forest feels inevitable; bold risk in "occasionally everywhere" physics heightens stakes via personal dissolution without gimmick. Transforms tropes through lived archive-planting specificity.</comment>
