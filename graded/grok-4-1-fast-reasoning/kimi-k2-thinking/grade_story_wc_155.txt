<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's embodied emotions (trembling hands, breath caught at fresco) and micro-choices (loading film, dancing light) reveal contradictory hollow-to-pulsing joy under fog's pressure, earning her final vow with visible cost in persistent mist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hollow murals to fresco discovery tightening stake, culminating in Charged Poise CR where fog thins for moonlight but carries blossom scent as conceptual cost—"the fog would return, but now it would carry the scent of blossoms."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog pools like mercury and lichen glow constrain path and carving sanctuary; recurring fog evolves to respect light display, charging final image where it carries blossoms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, deepens via fresco capture forcing light-painting trade-off; agency in display crystallizes stance with felt cost of fog's endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art as doorway emerges organically from particulars (fresco-film bridge); final image reweights fog from decay to blossoms without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable POV with perceptual signature (light pulses, photon watercolor); rhythmic lyricism modulates from hollow rhythm to pensive mirth, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (light like watercolor); minor repetition of "fog" and "light" taught as pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting, exposed film, foggy orchard transforms artist-journey trope; risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening resonance.</comment>
