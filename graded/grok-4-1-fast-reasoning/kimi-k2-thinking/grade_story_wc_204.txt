<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compress eternity intensifies through micro-choices like uncorking the whisper; contradictory rebellion against fluidity embodied in trembling hands setting type. Final smile as Earned Stasis forecloses permanence with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost spiral → projection → rupture reconfigures equilibrium; CR closure in merged libraries with conceptual cost ("moment was not hers to keep") legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard constrains via cracking panes following frost path; recurring light-through-holes charges inverted library reveal and final crystalline instant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of eternity-compression tightens accumulatively via whisper-release destabilizing sanctuary; agency in projection forces trade-off, cost in shattered consensus visible as upward-falling apples.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fixed meaning vs. fluidity emerges organically from ink rebellion to new frost-order; final "Here" and smile offer non-literal resonant reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in porous-glass noticing; lyrical diction ("smoke made of memory") modulates rhythmically under rising destabilization without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "million pages turning at once"; varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of negotiable reality, frost-fractals, perforated projection transforms library tropes; risk-taking in surreal merger inevitable from letterpress arc.</comment>
