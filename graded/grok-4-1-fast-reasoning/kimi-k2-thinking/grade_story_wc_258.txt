<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's steadily curious trait drives concrete actions like measuring the loft and charting timelines, embodying interiority without stock phrasing. Architect's loose suit and trembling hands reveal motivation rooted in hubris, earning his final hunger. Minor flaw: architect's change feels swift without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of card spreads and tape measurements builds patterns from collapse to roots. Orientation anchored early in loft and post-crash world. Closure as CR in final tape extension across spread, reweighting single chains to web with conceptual cost of delusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and measuring tape constrain choices, anchoring abstractions to space and charging final grid of futures. Sensory details (rain's metronome, onyx ink pooling) filtered through Mara's pattern bias, vivid and purposeful. No white-room; loft isolation above flood mirrors stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping cultural patterns tightens texturally when cards reveal crumbling towers and emerging roots, narrowing from panic to regrowth. Architect's realization forces stance crystallization with felt cost of hubris in "mirror reflecting his own hubris." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patterns over single truths emerges organically from cards, tape, and ink, reweighted in ending image of web vs. chain without moralizing. Subtext in negative space between towers invites ambiguity on greed's geometry. Resonant non-literal answer in "future wasn't a chain, but a web."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: Mara's bias notices "sacred geometry of greed" and vectors of regrowth. Poetic diction/rhythm modulates calmly, distinct from architect's whisper. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Show me how to build again").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (rain as "pixel in the pattern") propels accumulatively; rhythm varies with scene breath. Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "measuring tape" and "rain" motifs purposeful but verge ornamental, docking slightly without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crypto cartomancy mapping culture via tape/cards transforms tropes into "fractal of branching possibilities." Risky poetic frame heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via inherited mystery to new math. No derivative templates; bold premise coherence.</comment>
