<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in "letters flutter inside my chest" and "wound...began to close," revealing contradictory rage cradled by tenderness; Mira's presence forces micro-choices like kneeling. Earned closure via reading aloud forecloses silence with emotional cost. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "fierce tenderness" slightly genericizes voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from paddling to ritual climax; orientation anchored by ~50 words in swamp/moon/spirits. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration in letter release and shard pocketed, with sunrise cost legible in "healing would only last until sunrise." No causality breaks; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (wet sigh, broken glass voices) narrows under ritual urgency; mangrove roots constrain positioning for shard/letters. Recurring shard charges final image as pocketed reminder. Mangroves subtly mirror internal shift, evolving from labyrinth to song-carrier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology via letters) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's chant and spirits' urging to one deepening: evoking pre-decision moment forces raw reading. Agency in aloud apology forecloses silence; sunrise cost viscerally felt. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening over speaking emerges organically from condensation message and spirits' chorus reweighting letters. Final image of tide-sent letters answers "apology...in the listening" non-literally, with ambiguity in temporary healing. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like sister's face in water.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (e.g., "scent of salt and sorrow") biases toward grief-tinged senses; psychic distance modulates to intimate in "fingers brushed the stone." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Mira's whisper/chant. Consistent texture under stress; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overwriting in peak ritual ("fierce tenderness" x4, "tiny star" ink) muddles slightly without pattern payoff; paraphrase loops in healing descriptions ("wounds into whispers," "wound...close"). Rhythms vary read-aloud; propulsion strong to closure. Minor template cadence in ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of swamp ritual, gargoyle shard, and condensation oracle transforms grief trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via temporary healing constraint. Irreplaceable mangrove-spirits-song closure feels inevitable. Bold tone modulation avoids safety middle.</comment>
