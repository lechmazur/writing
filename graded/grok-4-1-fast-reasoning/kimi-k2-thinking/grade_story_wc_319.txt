<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: interiority embodied through tactile actions like licking the pendant and pawing ice, earning shift from guarding to embracing uncertainty; final realization as keeper of thresholds reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor slip: occasional label-speak ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") borders diagnostic without deeper embodied friction in pivotal pendant beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pendant discovery to interiorizing realities; CR closure ("never been exiled, only translated") lands on-page with conceptual cost of dissolved certainty in final door image. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via licking folds mist into mind, narrowing trapped stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist vivid/selective (crystallized glyphs, unthawing tablets), constraining choices like pawing ice; evolves causally (mist to pages, ice to ink) mirroring internal thaw. Recurring pendant/ice charge final image, with tactile sensory bias fitting guardian's feral perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. home-building) signaled early, accumulates texturally to tightening via pendant's shadow-truths forcing renunciation of certainty; agency in interiorizing forecloses exile path with felt cost ("lose the need for answers"). Minor abstractness dulls visceral price in door-formation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty-as-home emerges organically from particulars (pendant geometry, interiorizing); final image of mist-door offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting exile premise without moralizing. Subtext in shadow-visions and syntactic waiting builds lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (impossible geometries, glyph-hedges); voice texture modulates rhythmically from feral awakening to lucid dreaming, with purposeful compression in interiorizing beats enhancing foggy tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via image-stacking (mist→pages); purposeful "waiting" motif avoids loops, rhythm varies with short awakening lines building to expansive finals. Minor cadence similarity in "The guardian/It" openings slightly dulls peak dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian interiorizing infinite libraries transforms exile trope; bold lyric risk in "boundaries of light" premise heightens conceptual stakes, with door-from-mist reconfiguration inevitable from early pendant geometry.</comment>
