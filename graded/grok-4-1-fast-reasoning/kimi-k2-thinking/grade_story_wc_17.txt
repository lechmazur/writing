<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's sensitively perceptive trait and obsession drive concrete micro-choices like lifting diaries and developing the negative, earning her shift from burden to compass. Contradictory impulses (gift/burden) act in scene, shown in heart as drum and rib-shrapnel. Label repetition slightly abstracts embodiment at discovery peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic fossils build to diary/negative revelations, culminating in RR/Charged Poise where corridor dreams shift to "Remember, but act" with conceptual cost of unfinished action. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (ivy-veiled passage, post-shifts university). One tightening via formula reveal reconfigures options; cost legible in final seal/wax image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains via damp stones/echoes/fireplace ash, charging final forehead-press where dreams invite action. Sensory hierarchy (sonic primacy) reflects cartographer bias; frost-vines evolve from choke to breath. Pivotal: collapsed fireplace yields diaries, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wall dreams/suppressed knowledge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via negative's equation, forcing stance from remembrance to restoration. Agency in pocketing/developing/compiling forecloses passive mourning with cost of shared legacy. Escalation coherent under lens; chalkboard annotation ("math says otherwise") viscerally charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (legacy's burden as unfinished action) emerges from particulars like scorched equations and wall frequencies, reweighting via final dream-invitation without moralizing. Resonant CR in report-seal: walls dream human action. No tidy binary; ambiguity in hope lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sonic fossils, stone pulse). Rhythmic texture modulates: short punches at discoveries, longer flows in reflection. No head-hopping; elision of development weeks taught via purpose-shift, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("glimpsed...through the [object]" x4; "sensitively perceptive" x3; "legacy's burden" variants) create churn, dulling density in mid-revelation beats. Template cadence in repetitive stems ("She [action] the [object]"). Closure image propels cleanly despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic fossils in mortar as fresh post-climate frame transforms trope of lost knowledge; cartographer's mapping evolves organically to restoration. Risk in abstract "wall dreams" pays off via concrete negative/diaries, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
