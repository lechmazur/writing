<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Scribe's profession particularizes interiority through rituals like binding leaves and self-obituary, earning closure endurance; embodied gestures (tracing thread, whispering names) reveal values under solitude's pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; reflections verge on unearned epiphany without micro-costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("healing... not a place but a practice" reconfigures premise); cost legible in thread release as final offering. Orientation anchored early (scribe in garden post-ship); one deepening via self-obituary suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed garden, autumn leaves, fountain constrain rituals and charge final image (thread glinting like promise); sensory hierarchy (scent of decay/rebirth) mirrors POV bias toward absence. Micro-setting (thread, bench) evolves tactilely, selective details propel without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map healing's geography) signaled early, textural escalation via ritual density to realization tightens internal pressure, narrowing to acceptance/renunciation. Agency in writing self-obituary forecloses return illusion with felt cost (thread slip); one cadence shift coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of weaving loss/hope emerges organically from particulars (thread, leaves, obits), final image ("thread caught the light, glinting like a promise") offers resonant CR answer reweighting absence into practice. Subtext in silences/gestures avoids moralizing; earned ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (noticing "echoes of explained absences," "golden leaves like forgotten promises"); syntax/rhythm modulate reflective intensity consistently. Stable close-3rd POV, no leakage; pattern-taught poetic compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths at rituals, longer cadences in realizations); high density integrates image/action. Minor fig-lang density in closure beat ("shadows folding like a shroud") purposeful but borders overwrite; no loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obits-for-living, weft-thread lifeline, healing-as-geography transforms solitude tropes; self-obituary turn inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
