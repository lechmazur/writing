<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Philosopher's traits shown concretely through moon-mending and whisk actions; Kael's arc from skepticism to adoption feels earned via demonstration. Minimal contradictory impulses or embodied stress weaken depth; endurance lacks visible cost on pivotal teaching moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as firefly/moon/net patterns build density to CR closure in spreading revelation, reweighting unnoticed labor with conceptual cost of demure persistence. Structure fits shards over evenings with legible progression; one deepening via Kael's learning tightens appreciation stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nets and moonlight as micro-settings constrain mending choices and charge final vigil image; sensory details (whispers, firefly glow, tea aroma) filter through philosopher's perceptual bias. Vivid, purposeful integration avoids generics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort signaled early but remains observational with abstract tension; Kael's conversion deepens accumulatively yet lacks on-page trade-off or narrowed options. Villagers' skepticism adds no adaptive pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges from net patterns and firefly flickers without statement; final season-of-revelation image offers non-literal resonance reweighting solitary toil. Subtext in whisk as quiet rebellion enriches organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (light-threads, whispers) modulates rhythmically; stable third-limited POV taught via patterns, no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in teaching murmur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and image density; whisk-firefly repetition creates taught pattern payoff. Loops in "lifted...twirled" phrasing and paraphrase of patterns across sentences dull momentum in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-net philosophy and firefly luminescence transforms mentor trope; whistle-weaving risks lyric boldness heightening thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
