<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength in micro-choice to paint over the portrait, revealing hierarchy of values with cost of merging past self; weakness in repeated "haggard awe" as label-only phrasing that abstracts embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via brooch, trails, exchange to CR in "paint over the portrait, not to erase it, but to merge"; cost legible in foreclosed insomnia and unearthed continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain trails and tidal stone constrain path to watchtower exchange and charge final studio image; sensory hierarchy (squelching boots, bruised sky) reflects painterly bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threshing meaning deepens accumulatively through exchange reversal, narrowing options to merge past/present; agency in offering brooch forces stance crystallization with felt cost of forgotten hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of continuity emerges organically from brooch ant, bled paint, ongoing tides; final "ant seemed to move" offers resonant CR reweighting ruin as living tapestry without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature in "tide lapped at ruins" rhythms with intensity; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("rain trails had led him") advances without exposition; POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "haggard awe" and "rain trails" across realizations dull density (−0.6); strong rhythmic propulsion otherwise, with varied syntax supporting lyric accumulations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-water wars island as canvas, brooch as beacon transforms ruin trope; risk in lyric elisions pays off in charged final image without gimmickry.</comment>
