<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sculptor's motivation rooted in embodied hands tracing cracks and kinship with linemen compels strumming choice, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from discovery to hum to world response; Charged Poise closure in "silence not empty; it is full of music" lands with conceptual cost of deeper listening, oriented clearly by first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alder grove and porcelain constrain choices (branch as bow, sculpture as instrument) and charge final image of sanctuary symphonies; sensory hush vividly filters through sculptor's biased ear for tree-song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to pierce silence tightens texturally via deciphering cracks to strumming cascade, forcing endurance in "listen more deeply"; cost felt in fragile voice intertwining hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of music within silence emerges organically from cracks-to-chorus progression; final "soft note hanging" reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant via particulars like siskins tilting heads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of symphonic hearing (grain as melody); rhythmic modulation builds from hush to shimmer without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density in strumming beat ("hum grows into a chord"), but minor paraphrase loops on "silence/quiet" (e.g., "intensely quiet world" repeats) and repetitive "grove" stems dull late momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious porcelain-cracks-as-sheet-music transforms insulators into instrument, synthesizing silence with empathy in fresh, inevitable arc; risk of lyric hush pays off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
