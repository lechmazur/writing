<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's particular expertise shines in micro-choices like dipping brush in silence and layering loops, earning Elias's recovery; Elias's twitching fingers and clearing eyes embody internal conflict effectively. Minor weakness in Elias's underdeveloped interiority, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with silence layers building to all-loops cacophony; RR closure lands on-page as entity slips "like water through a sieve," reconfiguring stillness with ongoing cycle cost legible in Miriam's renewed recording.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bell tower, loop pedal, and indigo palette constrain choices and charge final image; dimensional anchor groans during climax, integrating setting into pressure. Sensory selection (humming pedal, painted air) reflects Miriam's priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise before 7 hours) escalates via density increase in looped questions and silence layers under Accumulative lens; agency in Miriam's pedal presses forces entity hesitation and convulsion, with cost in exposed "wound dressed in quiet."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unraveled assumptions emerges organically from rhetorical questions and indigo voids; final image of "silence itself... taught to speak in paradox" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in silence-as-paint noticing; voice rhythm modulates from looped whispers to cacophony, heightening pressure. Sparse dialogue carries subtext, like backward-looped "What is the sound..." advancing exorcism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through peak ("all loops at once"); purposeful "silence" repetition teaches pattern without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked figures like "shadow cast by doubt" slightly blurs one pressure beat but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theology-as-sound-design premise freshly synthesizes loops, indigo voids, and rhetorical exorcism; risk-taking in paradox cacophony heightens stakes organically, culminating in inevitable "silence taught to speak."</comment>
