<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied details like "quivering hush in her ribs," rooting motivation in grandfather's legacy; final renunciation of fire escape earned through prior micro-choices with planting. Minor label-speak ("wistfully pragmatic devotion") slightly abstracts traits without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to planting and CR closure ("translating it, turning grief into geometry"); orientation anchored by petal drop in first paragraph; cost legible in "purpose had outgrown its iron rails."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bitting gauge constrains planting choice ("used the gauge's tooth to score the earth") and charges final image ("gleamed in the dirt... invitation"); sensory details like "concrete still warm from the day's heat" and harbor salt filter through POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (instill light post-loss) deepens accumulatively through precise furrows to realization, narrowing from vertical grief to horizontal hope; cost felt in outgrowing fire escape, legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of precision-as-love emerges organically via gauge's evolution from key-tracer to seed-planter; final image ("gardener had become the lock, and the key, and the hand") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third-person with perceptual signature of measurement and moonlight shards; rhythmic motifs like "rhythm of oars" taught early, modulate intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("moon threw it back in shards of silver"); "rhythm of oars" repeats pattern-taught without loop penalty, propels to closure; minor motif churn on moonlight phrasing dings propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms locksmith tool into planting gauge, yielding inevitable "horizontal hope" from vertical loss; risk of lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
