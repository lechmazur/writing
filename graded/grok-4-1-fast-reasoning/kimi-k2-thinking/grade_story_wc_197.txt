<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resourcefulness embodied in concrete micro-choices like sketching puddle map and swallowing crystal compels higher-stakes decisions; internal endurance against erasure feels earned with visible physical cost, though minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously tempers peak 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain tightens via code failure to drone whine forcing crystal swallow and escape; closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with physical cost ("vomited it into a sieve") and reappearance reconfiguring stakes; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choices (key dips to reveal door, water floods servers) and charges final image (key reflections as maps); selective sensory details like bioluminescent gold and compost stench filter through Mara's urgent POV, mirroring rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to retrieve backup signaled early and escalates causally through plan unravel to drone pressure narrowing options; agency in smashing drives/escape with visible costs (physical ingestion, destruction) charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resistance to erasure emerges organically via water/memory motifs shifting from puddle map to final key reflections as "maps, like memories, like freedom"; resonant non-literal closure reweights indifference premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/water biased noticing) and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early via "flickered across screens like dying stars" pays off legibly in charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (reflections/light) propels without loops or muddle; minor overwriting in opening metaphors doesn't obscure drone-climax propulsion or final image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-map navigation, lagoon-key reveal, and crystal-swallow escape transforms dystopian rebel trope; risk-taking in vomit-sieve payoff feels inevitable from resourceful traits, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
