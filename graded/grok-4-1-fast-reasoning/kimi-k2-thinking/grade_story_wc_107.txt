<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in grief, with embodied thaw parallels (touching dampness to chest) driving micro-choices; contradictory impulses in abandoning restraint yield earned realization without epiphany shortcuts. Final bowl placement reveals values hierarchy with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably, with early orientation (stairs to control room) and on-page closure as Conceptual Repricing in bowl/bookmark image, reweighting grief's premise with conceptual cost of perpetual inquiry. New fracture beat tightens density toward ending without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constraints charge closure: leak's meltwater fills bowl, gauge flickers from 42% to 43%, mirroring internal thaw; selective sensory details (residual hum, rhythmic pulses) filter through glassblower's priorities, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's thaw via glass vessels) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through fracture discovery narrowing to abandonment and bowl; agency in "abandoned his usual restraint" forces trade-off, with cost legible in "weighty lightness" realization charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry's safe zones emerges organically from thawing images and bowl's purpose, culminating in non-literal answer ("crack wasn't a flaw—it was an entrance") that reweights grief without moralizing; resonant ambiguity lingers in sparrows' attention and perpetual thaws.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing grief-glass-dam parallels) and rhythmic modulation reflecting contemplative rhythm; diction/prose embodies glassblower's mind, modulating purposefully without filter excess or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., "dance of heat and breath"); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle or loops, even in peak realization; zero artifacts, closure image sharpened by precise phrasing like "flickered, just for a moment."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing grief ritual in decaying dam transforms thaw trope via specific vessels for doubt; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, with control room/glassblower ingenuity feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
