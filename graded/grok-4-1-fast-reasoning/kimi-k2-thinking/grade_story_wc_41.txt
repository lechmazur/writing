<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait concretely constrains actions, like visions dissolving before naming, compelling markers and listening; embodied longing peaks in chalk dust in palm. Internal contradiction between seeking and inevitable forgetting earns final renunciation with felt cost in erased memory. Minor abstraction in emotional embodiment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog, markers, echoes builds to hearing the rumble, chalk snap as pattern break. Orientation anchored immediately in junkyard and garden. Closure as CR—"clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow"—reprices premise with conceptual cost of forgetfulness legible in spiral remnant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog sculpture garden and junkyard relics (rusted VCRs, Betamax shells) constrain navigation and charge images, mirroring internal states through tactile handling like pressing finger to vibrating screen. Sensory hierarchy selective: hum, crunch, mist over visual catalog. Chalk and driftwood as micro-settings evolve, guiding choices to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture aging's sound signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening density to audible rumble and chalk snap narrowing options. Agency in arranging markers and drawing spiral forces endurance with cost in snapped chalk and fading echo. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in "tidal longing" legibility holds back higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of futile grasp on time emerges organically from chalk sigils erased, sound captured then lost, culminating in non-literal answer: driftwood points "onward, into the uncharted silence of tomorrow." Recurring echo motif reweights without moralizing. Final image recharges particulars with ambiguity of lingering hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical 3rd-limited POV stable, perceptual signature mistily associative ("futures that dissolved like mist"). Rhythmic control modulates from hum to swelling rumble under pressure. Purposeful compression in forgetful elisions taught early, paid in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action like "pried it open with trembling fingers, half-expecting a vision to slip away." Purposeful tidal metaphors consistent, no muddle in peak (chalk snap echoes louder than fog). Minor synonym churn on "echo"/"sound" purposeful but nudges down from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junkyard mysticism and sonic aging, transformed via precognitive forgetfulness into inevitable release. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; final gull cry recharges premise inventively. No derivative echoes; feels singular vision.</comment>
