<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atlas's contradictory impulses—Council directives vs. prophetic pull—act simultaneously in tracing shadows and transmitting despite enforcers, earning the final treasonous broadcast with loneliness as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of frequencies, shadows, and etchings culminates in CR closure: dish points to tomorrow, Atlas vanishes, prophet rises with treasonous cost legible in "enforcers would come by dawn."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains final step onto slick glass amid lightning and reveals etchings, charging closure image; storm scatters notes, forcing micro-choice in transmission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of variant allegiance tightens via dish adjustment clarifying prophet's voice, forcing broadcast agency that forecloses Council path with enforcer cost felt in abandonment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tunable allegiance emerges from particulars like shadow charts and final broadcast; child's cobalt eyes reweight era shift non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "quantum hiss into poetry" and rhythmic modulation under storm stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final verse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peak storm beat ("fist through portico") consistent but borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio prophecy and ancient shadows transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in gritty-poetic voice heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable CR of eras' threshold.</comment>
