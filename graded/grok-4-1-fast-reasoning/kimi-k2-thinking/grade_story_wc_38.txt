<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in encrypting vulnerability drives choices like dice rolls and dances; interiority poetic but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, relying on summary over embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of dances building to on-page closure via final 'liberate' sequence; resonant reconfiguration lands with flood-as-baptism cost legible in emergence image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunken lab's rust, diodes, and recycled air constrain survival and dance; spider web as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring tactical patience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant escape stake signaled early escalates accumulatively through repeated dances to climax performance; agency in final sequence forecloses captivity with flood risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability encoded as strength emerges from dance/web/dice particulars; final sunlit emergence offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting fear without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of choreographed code; rhythm modulates but occasional overwrought phrasing borders register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops (spider web/journal/dance motifs restated identically in final paragraphs) dull closure propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors reduces density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dance-as-cipher premise ingeniously transforms code-breaking trope via dice and web; fresh synthesis of vulnerability/strength feels inevitable in escape reconfiguration.</comment>
