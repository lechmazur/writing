<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear in search for truth shifting to remembrance, earned via waves' revelation; interiority concrete in "heart a drum" but slips to stock phrasing elsewhere; contradictory impulses mild, lacking scene-acting tension before epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from crank to standing waves' vision; CR closure lands on-page in "his role was not to end a dynasty, but to remember it" with conceptual cost of reweighted identity; orientation anchored early in sepia room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone vividly constrain via relics' discovery; golden shadows recur to mirror internal shift, charging final image of "golden shadows whispered farewell"; sensory hierarchy visual/tactile purposeful for mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through waves' "shimmering crest" narrowing to knowledge change; cost legible in foreclosed "sever" path, felt in silent gasp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance over ending emerges organically from melody's voices and final keeper role; resonant CR in "some truths are best sung in the golden shadows" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadow/music bias; voice modulates poetically but repetitive diction erodes distinction under revelation's peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive loops ("golden shadows" x6, "first yawn of evening" x3) and paraphrase redundancy in final third dull closure image; template cadence in "He [action]" runs; overwriting muddles with stacked metaphors throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone waves unveiling dynasty twist transforms heritage trope; risk in lyric accumulative build heightens quiet revelation without gimmick.</comment>
