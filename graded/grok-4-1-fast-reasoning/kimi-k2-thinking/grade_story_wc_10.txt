<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via heat-mapping as particular lens on emotions, embodied in notebook and fork strikes; final endurance of silence earned through sequence of trials. Minor flaw: survivors lack crucible interaction, but single-POV defaults hold without penalty. Contradictory impulses (force sound vs. embrace vibration) act in the striking sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional patterns and vibrations build density to Charged Poise closure in "silence was no longer a void; it was a canvas," with conceptual cost of renouncing audible music legible in brother's reflection and case closing. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via fork sequence suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory and frost constrain choices (resonant surface, visual canvas) and charge final image ("frost etched a delicate pattern"); heat signatures as micro-setting filter perception purposefully. Sensory hierarchy (vibration over absent sound) mirrors stakes; no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fork strikes darkening/lightening heat-maps, narrowing to vibration-based music with felt cost in room's emotional shifts. Protagonist agency in sequence forces trade-off (audible vs. silent form); one deepening charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-canvas emerges organically from heat-map/vibration particulars, reweighted in final image without moralizing; brother's reflection offers non-literal resonance to translation motive. Counter-reading (grief's persistence) lingers via blue sorrow shifts; no thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (heat colors, vibrations) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from whisper-breath calm to ripple intensity in fork strikes. Purposeful compression of silent world taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost painted the panes" advances setting/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion, no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting in repeated "silent" motifs purposeful for theme; closure image clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent apocalypse, heat-mapping, and tuning forks on glass transforms survival trope via vibration-emotion logic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at case-closing reprise. No derivative templates; conceptual integrity commits to premise.</comment>
