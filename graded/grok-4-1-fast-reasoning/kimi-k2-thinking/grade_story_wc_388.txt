<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent traits and motivation drive Elias's discoveries, with micro-choices revealing value hierarchy in observations over safety, but lacks dramatized contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during reconstruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of anomalies tightening to CR closure—final confrontation reconfigures lies with conceptual cost to authority—in legible single-scene arc; cost undeniable in "let them choose their own curse."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard roots, geothermal soil warmth, and dust devils constrain choices and charge final image, with sensory details (rad-count drops, mutated bees) filtered through observant POV and integrated into goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) signaled early escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations narrowing options to confrontation; agency in piecing letters forces trade-off with social cost legible pre-closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patterns over authority emerges organically from particulars like orchard geometry and curse fabrication, with final image offering resonant CR repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (anomaly-pattern noticing) and rhythmic control sustain third-limited POV under pressure; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels forward, but minor paraphrase loops on "patterns" (e.g., "pattern emerged," "patterns spoke louder") slightly dull mid-reconstruction density without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc bunker via flawed diamond/orchard refracts tropes through observant debunker lens; risk in conceptual CR heightens stakes organically.</comment>
