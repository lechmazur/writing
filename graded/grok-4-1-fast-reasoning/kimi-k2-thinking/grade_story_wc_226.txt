<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's defiant micro-choices, from painting verses to hurling the phial, earn his softening realization at climax; mischievous trait enables Mara's alliance without safety-hedging. Internal contradiction layers as rebellion fractures into communal possibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry density builds to phial's shatter, delivering CR closure where spectral display refracts ritual truth across towers with Elders' visible hesitation as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and mist-veiled spire constrain climbing/painting and charge phial's rainbow shatter, mirroring internal refraction; sensory echoes amplify without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively via poetry planting seeds in Mara, culminating in phial throw that forces Elders' procession halt; fractured authority reweights options with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forgiveness premise reweighted non-literally by final spire monument and children's glass mimicry, emerging from particulars without moralizing; resonance lingers in canyon's exhaled possibilities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature—prisms in bones, light spears—sustains under pressure; Mara dialogue carries subtext, distinct from Kael's idiom, advancing defiance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High figurative density purposeful in accumulative build, but minor "refract/prism" synonym churn across climax beat slightly dulls propulsion; rhythm varies effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone-ribcage canyon and literal light vandalism transform sacrifice trope into chromatic rebellion; phial hurl feels inevitable from poetry pattern.</comment>
