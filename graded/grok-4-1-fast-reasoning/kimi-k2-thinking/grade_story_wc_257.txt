<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief intensifies compellingly to self-mirroring via Mnemosyne, with earned change in origami method; embodied emotions strong but occasional abstract interiority like "motivation crystallized" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in time-loop realization ("stencil had been her future self"), cost legible in grief's reconfiguration; orientation anchored early in observatory, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's central lens and airlocks constrain key actions like illuminating stencil and releasing origami, charging final crane image; sensory details purposefully filter through Elara's grief-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to teach bloom escalates accumulatively via star's pulse-shift and woman's arrival, forcing stance crystallization; agency in folding/leaving shows trade-off cost in dissolving figures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of artificial-becoming-real emerges organically from origami-to-jewelry evolution, resonant CR in loop without moralizing; final "fold beginnings" reweights grief premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic voice distinct with perceptual bias toward stellar decay, stable single POV; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in woman's whisper, advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with scene cadence, high density propels via image integration; figurative density like "curtains of intention" taught early as pattern, minor repetition of "genuinely artificial" motif contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-loop via stellar origami transforms mourning tropes; risk-taking in timeless causality heightens stakes, inevitable in "future self reaching backward."</comment>
