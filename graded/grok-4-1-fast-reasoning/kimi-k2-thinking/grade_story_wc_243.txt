<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to regenerate covenant roots in concrete spark of locket photo, compelling micro-choices like climbing and inking; embodied shiver of haunted euphoria shows contradictory resolve. Interiority particular via ink-stained hands and memory cues, earning quiet communal shift. Minor flaw: archetypal preservation without deeper contradictory impulses in pivotal writing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from archive dust to jetty ink to village ripples, tightening via resolve on "steep hillside" toward CR closure in final quote reweighting context. Orientation anchored early in scroll-lifting; one meaningful deepening suffices. Closure cost legible in "shiver of haunted euphoria" as felt price of renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jasmine scent, moss-stones, lapping water selectively constrain climb and writing, mirroring internal regeneration; twilight evolution charges final gust. Recurrent jetty planks as micro-setting guide choices, filtering through archivist's preservative gaze. POV bias sharpens sensory hierarchy to ink/memory cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant) signaled in photo spark, deepens accumulatively through jetty writing narrowing drift/anchor options. Agency in vial withdrawal and quill strokes forecloses loss with felt shiver cost. Pressure coheres to communal lantern image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of small moments rebirthing covenants emerges via ink-photo-jetty arc, final quote offering non-literal reweighting of "context changes" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like jasmine bouquet ripples outward. Counter-reading lingers in haunted cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in reverent ink/scroll noticing; lyrical rhythm modulates from gentle archive to charged jetty poise. Voice texture distinct in biased details like "salt-kissed twilight," compression purposeful under resolve. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "each stroke a proximate cause" advances causality/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Minor paraphrase loops in "steep" echoes voice-motivated but cap high-band. Zero scaffold in closure quote; no filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis transforms archival trope into communal ink-map renewal, risking poetic elision taught early via scroll dust. "Walnut-ink" jetty covenant feels inevitable hindsight via particulars. Bold tone modulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
