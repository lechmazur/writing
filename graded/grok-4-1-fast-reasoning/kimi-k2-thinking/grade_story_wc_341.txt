<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through cloud-emotion lens; obsession flaw drives micro-choices like loading final spool despite fall risk. Contradictory impulses (career loss vs. validation) act in final recording beat. Earned closure choice reveals values hierarchy with conceptual cost of earthly rejection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in "Her proof was complete... pointed upward, a monument," reweighting premise with sky-validation cost legible in sealed spool and tethered chute. Single scene anchored early (gondola tilt/cable hiss by para 1). No orientation debt; pattern of memory-cued observations tightens to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gondola tilt/dead instruments constrain recording choice; "acceptance" cloud envelops and cradles at climax, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (hissing cable, clicking recorder) reflects meteorologist bias. Clouds/weather evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sky-memory) signaled early, deepens via Thorne-cloud link narrowing to record-or-fall binary. Agency in speaking final entry forecloses denial path with felt cost (gondola shudder/equilibrium trade-off). Escalation via textural density under lens; cost unmistakable in "sealed the spool, smiling."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (atmosphere remembers human absence) emerges implicitly from spools/clouds; final gondola-as-cradle image reconfigures "empty spaces" premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; lingering ambiguity (earthly reception) embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature (clouds as emotions); diction/rhythm modulate from tense (groaning metal) to poised (breathing dark). Prose texture reflects mind-state; purposeful poetic compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cranked the canister open... clicking like insect wings" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor repetition of "empty spaces remember" pattern-taught and charges closure without loop penalty. No artifacts; metaphors coherent (spooled ghosts).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional meteorology transforms stranded-scientist trope; sky-memory premise follows implications boldly to CR payoff. Risky cloud-personification heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight via spool motif.</comment>
