<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied uncertainty and micro-choices under failing workshop pressure compel the final inhalation; contradictory impulses act in scene with earned endurance. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "uncertainty was her discipline" borders therapy-speak but ties to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of memory stitches tightening to CR closure in statue's sigh and Elara's transformative inhale; cost legible in "lungs burned with dire enchantment." Orientation anchored early in workshop-sea setup; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea foam hissing and mercury spill constrain breath-timed choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy narrows to hypoxia-blurred pockmarks. Micro-setting of workbench and porthole evolves causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory-quilting before exchanger failure escalates accumulatively via lurching waves narrowing breath options; agency in charm rotations forecloses survival path with inhale cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from stitching sea's dream-memory into self, reweighting brokenness in final "scars singing" image without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from Elara's arc; ambiguity in transformation lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of alchemical poetry ("mind's needle," "liquid sunrise"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in short, gasped beats. Lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful kintsugi metaphors, but figurative density in peak charm rotations risks muddle (hammer/needle/embroidery stack); no loops, strong propulsion. Minor paraphrase on "uncertainty" but pattern-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea alchemy and memory-pockmark kintsugi transforms trope of doomed repair into gilded survival; risk in lyric escalation inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
