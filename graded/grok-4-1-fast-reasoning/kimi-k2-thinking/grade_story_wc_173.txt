<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's chaste professionalism roots her poetic dance motivation credibly, with embodied strain ("heart hammered," "body aching") earning her shift from performance to authentic being; micro-choices in untangling reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dance builds echo density to prism shatter (DC) with cost legible in "weight of consequence settled" and future hunt; single scene shards cohere without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snowflakes as "forgotten syllables" and crystalline walls constrain dance choices tactilely, charging closure image of snow catching fractured light; selective sensory filter (cold air, starlight spectra) mirrors rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy lullaby via unlock) signaled early tightens accumulatively through freed echoes layering voices; agency in poetic gestures forecloses conformity path with bodily/future costs felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion in "spaces between notes" emerges organically from echo harvest and dance, resonating in final image of taught voices without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in winter reprisal seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias (poetic body notices threads, light facets); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under dance pressure, eliding mechanics purposefully for textural build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak dance ("arms weaving...pulling invisible strings") without full pattern payoff, creating minor coherence drag; motif recurrences ("between sigh and smile") propel effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dance as thread-untangling to free echoes transforms conformity trope via bodily poetry and prism mechanics; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
