<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's interiority shines in embodied sacrifice ("warmth against her fingertips like a tiny heart"), with contradictory grief driving the final weaving choice; motivation intensifies credibly from failed attempts to reciprocity demand. Micro-choices like placing the bead in the shuttle reveal values hierarchy with visible memory cost. Single-POV coherence flawless, flaws (grief-blindness) compound to earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle fragments build density to reveal pattern ("new geometry of silence"), culminating in on-page RR/CR as bead vanishes and silence wholes with legible cost ("surrendered moments"). Orientation anchored early (orchard, Mei, thirty years). No causality breaks; final piece incites pivotal reciprocity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bamboo orchard and loom constrain choices (puzzle spread across warp threads), charging final image (bamboo nods, plum drops). Sensory hush/mist selective via POV urgency; bead/loom as micro-setting evolve tactilely ("cardboard hum against her ribs"). No white-room; lived-in navigation perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend silence for message) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puzzle fitting and memory surrender tightening options; agency in shuttle passes forecloses memories with on-page cost ("Lin's first laugh" pulled). Final image crystallizes trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from weave/sacrifice particulars, final image ("stone so polished by loss it could shine") offers non-literal CR reweighting raveling into wholeness without moralizing. Subtext in bead's glow layers loss/completion; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (hush as woven thread); stable single-POV distance modulates rhythmically for density build, no leakage. Compression taught early pays in closure weave; diction biased to weaver's idiom ("raveling tapestry").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("clicking like a tongue learning speech"); figurative coherent and pattern-taught (threads/light/shadow), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor overwriting in opening labels offset by propulsion; ear-test passes fully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom/silence/puzzle transforms grief trope via cardboard-dissolving threads and message reciprocity; risky lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes inevitably. No derivative echoes; premise bold, closure-charging.</comment>
