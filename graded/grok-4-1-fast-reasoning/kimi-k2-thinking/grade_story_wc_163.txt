<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in breath synchronization with fireflies, earning transformation choice amid doubt; minor slip in over-articulated epiphany at "belonging was not a place you occupied, but a waveform."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from feather projections to plaza microbes, landing CR closure in feather-to-sternum sync and empty submersible with legible cost of surface exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Facility depths and feather constrain descent/escalation, charging final image as feather drifts on plaza stones; astrologer bias filters rust-flowers into constellations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove belonging before oxygen ends) deepens via firefly pattern reveal, forcing renunciation of submersible with felt cost in "final surface-born breath"; agency in pressing feather drives under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonant CR reweights belonging as resonance through feather-firefly progression, final image of drifting feather answering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (ghost-maps, galactic fish) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation heightens sync beat; AI whisper natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines propels to closure; figurative pattern (nebulae, waveforms) taught early pays off without muddle, minor overwrought density in opening corridors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrologer decoding drowned-city resonance transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in quiet CR transformation inevitable from feather logic.</comment>
