<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via stained fingers and memory rhythm compels lock-tapping choice, earning rebirth; embodied grief contradicts creative urge in pivotal rectification beat. Minor diagnostic label ("mnemonically gifted") in frustration well slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with memory density tightening to snap ("A soft snap echoed"), delivering RR closure via drawing onset with legible sorrow cost in final sketch image; orientation anchored early, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystals' hum and faint light constrain hiding urge while charging final sketch ("capturing the way they caught the faint light"); tactile damp floor and mineral drips filter through artist POV, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity) signaled early, deepens via rhythm application narrowing options to success-with-sorrow; agency in tapping forecloses hiding path with felt cost in "auroral sorrow that sang of loss."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable art amid grief emerges organically from lock-to-charcoal arc, resonant in final dawn sketch reweighting loss; note's "Draw the dawn" borders overt but ties to image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/face noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from heavy silence to scratching cadence, distinct artist texture intact under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("inescapable calling(s)" x3, "auroral sorrow" x3, repeated lock/heart barriers) and synonym churn in realizations dull closure propulsion; overwriting in ending realizations with mixed vehicles ("tomb...womb") obscures snap payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm-as-lock-code ingeniously transforms grief trope, with cave womb/tomb synthesis feeling inevitable; bold lyric accumulative risk heightens rebirth stakes without gimmick.</comment>
