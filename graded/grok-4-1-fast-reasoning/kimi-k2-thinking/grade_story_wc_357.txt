<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in family orchards and grandmother's cryptic words compels micro-choices like releasing controls; embodied warmth of arrow tip grounds interiority. Final fusion of arrow and seed earns change with felt cost of accepting die-off. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal arrow guidance + accumulative imagery) holds to CR closure: realization reweights resilience premise with conceptual cost in "grow through the dying." Orientation anchored early in launch; single scene tightens via arch entry. Cost legible in seed's "genetic grief."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and water ribbons constrain glider navigation and charge final descent image; mist veil and seed cyclone filter through pilot's urgency. Sensory hierarchy sharpens on currents, hums, temperature drop. Body/tool (glider, arrow) shapes choices indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard resilience) tightens via seed cyclone confrontation, narrowing to scarred seed touch; agency in drifting forces renunciation of "fighting the die-off." Cost felt in echoes' "genetic grief" altering tactics. Single deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience as "grow through the dying," resonant in seed-archive realization without statement. Final image reconfigures prior motifs (arrow, echoes) non-literally. Complexity lingers in embracing damage's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in water-flow bias and glyph-reading; rhythmic diction modulates from whirling hum to sigh. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at CR. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in flight beats; "whirling silence" pattern purposeful, not loop. Minor elevated diction in glyphs but voice-consistent. Closure image crisp, no scaffold dulling fusion moment.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inversion physics, arrow-seed fusion transforms tropes into "resilience accelerates...because of [damage]" calculus. Risky lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from grandmother's words.</comment>
