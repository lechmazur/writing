<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to find quiet intensifies compellingly through failed first conjure and humming alignment, embodied in chest vibrations and bone-felt silence; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with vibration/glow density building to Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("The bloom of hush unfurled, a silent explosion"); cost legible in stone dimming and effort; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice crack patterns and frozen pool constrain choices, shifting to mandala under hum; recurring cave throbs mirror internal shift, charging final "caves breathed a sigh."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet vs. storm) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via failed sphere to humming success narrowing chaos options; agency in alignment, cost in stone's dimming felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence emerges organically from hush blooms and cyclical repose, reweighting storm premise in final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in resonant sensations (chest vibrations, skin pressure); poetic diction ("hammered repose") consistent and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("hammered repose" x4, dual near-identical bloom/hum cycles, verbatim "gently luminous") and paraphrase redundancy in trailing endings dull propulsion and obscure closure image; overwriting metaphors pervade without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapkeeper role, hush blooms, and resonant caves transforms quiet-in-chaos trope into inevitable poetic cycle.</comment>
