<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between haunted ambition and methodical patience act in the carving beat, earning the final renunciation of ambition as wisdom with embodied cost in fingertips hovering "a touching distance away."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of analogy and carving reconfigures the stake into CR at "transition has no moment, only a field," with cost legible in the resolved ambition and steadying arbor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor and star-iron stylus constrain the pivotal carving choice, charging the final image of the seed rooting in analogical space; sensory details like "sang as it scored" filter through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reestablishing architecture tightens via analogical realization and carving, narrowing options with felt cost in the city's imminent fall, though one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition as braid emerges organically from particulars like wedge signs and field distribution, with final image of fruit falling offering non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in analogical noticing ("magnetic attraction to the gravity of memory") and rhythmic control modulate with pressure; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels through carving beat; minor repetition of "haunted ambition" purposeful but nudges from perfect, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform on magnetic fields and spirits-as-distributions feels inevitable, with risk-taking in analogical physics heightening stakes in the carving climax.</comment>
