<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied thaw from estrangement via raw desperation in calls, with contradictory impulses (cherish fragile threads amid eternity's weight); final snap earned by prior loop burden. Minor slip in told motivation ("surfaced: to teach endings how to begin") lacks full contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: loop density builds pressure via repeating calls, pattern breaks on disc touch/snap (DC with cut palms cost). Orientation anchors immediately; closure legible as before/after reconfiguration without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass walls, stool, stale air, iron beams constrain choices (climb to snap disc); shattered disc charges final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (low hum narrowing to piercing note) reflects isolation's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape loop/estrangement) signaled early, tightens via persistent repetition forcing touch-then-snap agency under Accumulative lens; cost (cuts, unburdened heart) unmistakable in shattering beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Emergent theme (endings as doorways) via calls-to-disc arc, but final paragraphs' explicit echoes ("taught endings how to begin," "every ending is only the start") moralize, replacing image resonance with restated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (tunnel sighs, disc hums as emotional proxies); poetic rhythm modulates from mournful to piercing without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ending paraphrase loops ("Mira smiled... new story," "hum... lullaby," repeated "taught endings how to begin" variants) and template cadence (serial image restatements) dull closure propulsion; −1.4 artifact pack for final-third spread obscuring snap's crispness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted booth-loop with disc-shatter turning estrangement to bridge; risk in melodic haunting pays off via causal break without gimmick. Transformation elevates tropes organically.</comment>
