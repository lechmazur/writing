<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Kael's bold sympathy—touching the grieving mother yet facing rejection—earning the final grafting realization with relational cost. Interiority particular via reed sculptures mirroring loneliness; no unearned epiphanies until closure paid by search. Girl as secondary pressure forces micro-choices aligning with outsider flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn/dusk searches build density toward tag discovery as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring belonging with felt cost of transformed loneliness ("sharp and shared"). Orientation anchored early (crater, orchard, Kael's outsider status); pattern taught by first girl encounter. Closure cost legible in sculpture placement and arbor's song fusing names.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard/crater constrains searches (roots at branch-earth meet); recurring arbor glass/reeds charge final image, mirroring internal states via refracted shadows/lineage maps. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (humming frequencies Kael learns). No white-room; spatial choreography clear from marsh to roots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting via arbor understanding) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through shared searches narrowing isolation options; agency in pursuing tag forecloses outsider path. Escalation via villagers' offerings tests commitment; cost unmistakable in "luminescent ache" of roots taking hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kinship-as-dedication emerges from particulars (failed sympathy to shared tag hunt); final spiral tag/CR reweights premise without moralizing ("belonging-in-difference"). Subtext in silences/gestures invites ambiguity; no tidy binary, embraces outsider complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (frequencies, shadows as lineage); diction/rhythm modulate from solemn to pulsing solstice. Girl's traced dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elisions (tag) paid via search.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels accumulatively; purposeful lyric metaphors consistent without muddle until minor closure overwrite ("roots taking hold" echoes prior). No loops/scaffold; minor repetitive "roots/song" stems purposeful for pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass-kinship webs, street-tag glyph in obsidian arbor transforms outsider trope via textural drive; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes. Final reflection fusion inevitable from search particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
