<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in role as sensory map maker, but interiority leans abstract and epiphanic ("she understood that to become the voice..."); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with realization feeling declared rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fossil discovery to holographic forest and song, yielding Charged Poise closure in emergence with fossil companion; orientation anchored early, cost felt in boundary dissolution without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (salt/memory scent, silt floor, vibrating wall) mirrors emotional mapping; cave and fossil constrain path and charge final image, with POV bias in heat signatures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting unseen to voice unknown) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fossil-guided deepening to song; agency in following map/singing forecloses solitary mapping with felt dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silence via transitional objects emerges organically from fossil's grief-to-hologram shift and final map-song synthesis; resonant CR in waiting image reweights past/present without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (emotion as topography/heat); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative builds, diction purposeful though elevated; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density, but minor paraphrase loops ("voice of the unknown" recurs declaratively) and dense figuratives ("tapestry of colour," "shroud") slightly muddle peak song beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi emotion-mapping and mystic fossils transforms post-apocalyptic trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in fossil-companion image, feeling inevitable.</comment>
