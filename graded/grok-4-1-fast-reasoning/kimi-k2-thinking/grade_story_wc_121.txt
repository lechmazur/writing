<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength in clear motivation ("to conquer the labyrinth of self") rooted in periodic eternity trait, but weakness in abstract interiority lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses; epiphanies like "You are the labyrinth" feel diagnostic rather than embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("to conquer the self... was to accept that no center existed"); cost legible in "surrender to the labyrinth" and dissolution image; orientation anchored early on viaduct.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (phosphorescent moss, crimson glow) integrated into action; viaduct constrains choices (stepping into darkness) and charges final image ("stones slowly dimming").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquer labyrinth) signaled early with accumulative deepening via tablet truth and timeline collapse narrowing options; agency in rune touches forces trade-off, cost felt in final surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-dissolution emerges organically from particulars like cracking tablet and folding corridors; final image ("raindrop... suspended") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting conquest into recursion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in mythic diction ("fractured timelines folded... like paper"); rhythmic modulation under pressure enhances surreal texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with purposeful repetition ("between the drop and the ripple") taught as motif; minor paraphrase loops in realizations (e.g., multiple "glowing viaduct" variants) slightly dull peak beats but pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation and self-labyrinth transforms tropes into inevitable recursion; risk-taking in surreal structure heightens conceptual stakes, fully committed without retreat.</comment>
