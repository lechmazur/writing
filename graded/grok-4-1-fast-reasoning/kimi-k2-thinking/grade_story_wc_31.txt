<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in synesthetic obsession is consistent and intensifies through purposeful descent, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realization at "the color of silence" feels epiphanic without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with sensory density building to CR closure at "lifted it to his ear and heard... the color of silence: a clear, brilliant white," reweighting quest with conceptual cost of silence-as-sound; orientation anchored early, single-shard structure fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sunken library and key tag constrain exploration (water lapping, descent/ascent) and charge final image; synesthetic sensory hierarchy filters details purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled early with textural deepening via log and lantern flicker narrowing to realization; lacks option-foreclosing trade-off, but reconfiguration carries felt quest cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of luminous silence emerges through recurring synesthetic images without statement, resonating non-literally in closure's white silence; ambiguity lingers meaningfully without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct synesthetic perceptual signature (sounds as colors, flicker as language); lyrical rhythm modulates effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in every sentence (e.g., "shelves bowed like the ribs of a whale, books bloated") creates coherence strain and propulsion drag; paraphrase loops on "luminous vow"/glow motifs across paragraphs obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic lamplighter quest in sunken library transforms sea-treasure trope into fresh textural synthesis; final key-to-ear image feels inevitable and risk-heightening.</comment>
