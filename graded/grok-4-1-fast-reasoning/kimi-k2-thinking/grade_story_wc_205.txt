<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory fire-turned-ash resolve and embodied shard-tracing reveal character under pressure; Voss confrontation forces earned endurance with relational cost in silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery layers to Charged Poise closure in Voss's nod and "burnished sorrow"; orientation anchored early in asteroid/Kael intro; cost legible in merged past/present crucible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's spires/halls and temporal storms constrain shard-mirror ritual; recurring mirror charges final poem image, mirroring internal truth veils.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Truth-reveal stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via storm/devise; shard-press agency forecloses Voss's narrative with conceptual cost in silent acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fragile truth vs. curated lies emerges organically from shard/poem; silence reconfigures empire premise without moralizing, lingering in unresolved reimagination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent poetic perceptual signature ("poet's eye," temporal veils) modulates with storm intensity; clean single-POV distance heightens lyric resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Purposeful poetic rhythm varies, but paraphrase loops ("covering the mirror" repeated across beats) and dense metaphors slow reflective propulsion; minor overwriting in peak storm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visible time/shard-lens on baroque asteroid transforms revolutionary trope into lyric sci-fi; risky accumulative poetry inevitable at poem-reveal hindsight.</comment>
