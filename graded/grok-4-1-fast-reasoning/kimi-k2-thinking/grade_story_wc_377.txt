<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied erosion ("her own colors seeping into her work") and earned shift from preservation to transmission via child's arrival; contradictory impulses in accepting self-dissolution as cost. Minor abstraction in reflective summaries slightly distances peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in final image (child's touch floods color as promise, reweighting premise with tuner's self-erasure cost); orientation anchored early (bluff, mute vow); pattern of reflective shards taught and legible. Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iceberg fragments and wind constrain sculpture mechanics and charge final image ("cast blue shadows on the clouds"); sensory hierarchy (tremor through stone, blue breath) reflects POV priorities. Altitude's "strange magic" evolves causally to preserve ice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via masterpiece completion and child's arrival as deepening that narrows to transmission; cost legible in self as "vessel." Minor abstractness in "symphonies of truth" slightly mutes visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (resonance over words) to resonant CR ("not preservation but transmission"); final image reweights without moralizing. Complexity in wonder's cost (self-hollowing) avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("truth... a resonance that could shiver through matter") and rhythmic modulation build to charged poise; stable third-close POV with lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure image. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (ice "weeping light") cohere without muddle. Minor overwriting in early reflective beats ("language had dissolved like morning mist") creates slight scaffold, but closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world with kinetic iceberg bells transforms tropes into inevitable CR; bold lyric risk (muted voice, glistening motifs) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to premise.</comment>
