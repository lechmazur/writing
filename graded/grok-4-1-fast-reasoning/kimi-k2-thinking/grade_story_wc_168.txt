<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in scarred hands cradling fragile box and arranging stones under guilt's pressure; final endurance of "long carry of memory" earned by prior choice's weight, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in "weight shift from her hands to her shoulders—a pack frame for the long carry," with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early via ridge and box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Box and scars as micro-settings constrain choices (cradling, arranging) and charge final image of "moonlight pooling in its broken places"; sensory details (cool porcelain, drifting ash) filter through fire-reader's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating guilt tightens accumulatively via realization shift "not to justify but to translate pain," forcing endurance with cost in carrying "the dying"; agency in leaving box forecloses release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-language emerges organically from box fractures mirroring constellations and scars as "stories," reweighting premise in final box image without moralizing; resonant answer to choice's burden via teaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with fire-perceptual signature ("fire's language," "breathed through canyons") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in spoken line "I thought I was choosing who lived, but only how to carry the dying."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor pattern (fractures, dances, languages) paying off at closure; minor paraphrase loops in reflection ("reflecting deeply," carrying motifs) slightly dull mid-beats but spare propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter guilt via porcelain relic and celestial witness transforms survival trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight through box's evolving fractures.</comment>
