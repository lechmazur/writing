<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve unspoken words intensifies credibly to her vow at dawn, rooted in flight from city and ghost's plea. Interiority concrete in noticing dust motes and clues but diluted by repetitive trait labels like "tranquilly perceptive." Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal realization moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of images (hives, light, box) builds to Charged Poise closure when ghost dissolves into light after box placement on altar, with felt cost of her endless vigilance. Orientation anchored early in oasis and recluse's shelter. One meaningful deepening at covenant realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective: rusted hives and scorched wasteland constrain via hollow combs and drought, mirroring internal states through dust motes in brittle light. Recurring fractured light through stained glass box charges final image, narrowing her options to preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend covenant/preserve words via bees) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via box discovery and ghost's plea, forcing her stance crystallization in restoration vow. Agency in lifting box and sealing note forecloses inaction with ongoing wasteland cost legible at dawn resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance beyond silence emerges organically from bee souls, covenant, and light motifs, reweighted in final box-on-altar image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: covenant endures through memory, not action alone. Complexity in broken promise lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/clue noticing; lyrical diction consistent and biased toward mute perceptions. Voice modulates subtly with intensity but risks overwrought repetition in spectral descriptions. No head-hopping; elision of ghost speech purposeful for tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("weight of unspoken words" x4 verbatim, "tangled covenant" x4, "mute eloquence" x3) and synonym churn (repeated "gaze/d") dull propulsion, with artifacts touching closure beat's box placement. Template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "She gazed... She lifted... She placed") triggers −1.5 cap. Density suffers from redundancy over advancement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beekeeping afterlife covenant in wasteland ghosts transforms tropes via specific glass box refraction and bee soul-carrying logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final ghost silhouette inflects organically from particulars.</comment>
