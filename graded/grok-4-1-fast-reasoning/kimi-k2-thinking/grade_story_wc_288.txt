<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in isolation pressing "like the cold glass of a specimen case," driving embodied internal conflict (exhilarating/terrifying mammoth sensation) and micro-choices like persisting among stones despite fracture risk. Final endurance as bridge earns change with visible self-threat cost. No safety-hedging; flaws (observer passivity) complicate toward resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from sundial touch to stone hum merger, culminating in CR closure where "brittle awakening solidify[ies] into a resilient truth" with conceptual cost of multiple selves. Orientation anchors early (Mara in tidal library post-reincarnation). One tightening via merged pulse reweights options; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ghosts "brush past her like mist," hum "resonate through her bones") filter via Mara's priorities, constraining choices (sundial touch, stone sitting). Stone circle and sundial charge final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Tidal shelves evolve with her heartbeat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signals early, escalates accumulatively via deepening sensations narrowing to self-fracture risk, forcing endurance agency. Cost unmistakable in "threatens to fracture her sense of self," altering to "carry[ing] the legacy." Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of independence as "carrying the legacy" emerges organically from particulars (ghost mergers, new language), final image of documenting scrolls offers non-literal resonance reweighting isolation without moralizing. Complexity in persisting amid terror avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased toward spectral rhythms ("frequencies of extinct heartbeats"); syntax/rhythm modulate with intensity (short, visceral under mammoth weight). No head-hopping; diction purposeful and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (long reflective waves to sharp "sharp and shimmering"). Minor paraphrase loops ("brittle awakening" motif purposeful, not churn) but no closure-dulling artifacts; metaphors consistent (atomic light on DNA).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal-time library, atomic sundial ghosts, and neural mergers transforms extinction trope into visceral bridge-arc; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via patterned hum/reflection buildup.</comment>
