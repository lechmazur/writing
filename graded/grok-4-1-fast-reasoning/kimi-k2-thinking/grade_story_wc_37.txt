<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in flashes compels raw, unsteady singing despite foreseen memory cost, earning stasis; contradictory amnesia and purpose act simultaneously in mica-touch and song beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of light/song building to RR closure via "mica window lay in shards... memory a scattering of stardust" with legible cost; redundant plot sequence ("placed the mica... final note echoed" echoed later) lacks one meaningful tightening, dulling causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (fermenting apples/copper scent, silver leaves chiming) filters through Elias's biased ear for songs in bark; greenhouse constrains choices like mica-pressing and tree-touching, charging final dawn image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, but no deepening under accumulative lens—repeats memory surge/song/light without narrowing options; cost felt in sacrifice but static pressure prevents tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial renewal emerges organically from song-weaving and memory-tradeoff, resonant in final "stardust" image reweighting shards motif; no moralizing, complexity in bittersweet fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with perceptual signature (shards as jigsaw/stars, songs in bark); rhythmic modulation suits textural build, though repetition slightly erodes propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (full core sequence—"mica against wall, glow, memory, sing, light spreads, mica cracks"—duplicated with minor synonym variation) kill density/momentum; overloaded similar metaphors (knit/weave/swaddle) muddle peak beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh non-obvious synthesis of memory orchard, mica prisms, and bark-songs transforms fantasy tropes into inevitable sacrifice arc; risk in lyric repetition heightens bound-release tone without gimmick.</comment>
