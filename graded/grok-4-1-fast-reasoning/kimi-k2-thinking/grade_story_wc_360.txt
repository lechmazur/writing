<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cassian’s contradictory impulses shine in borrowing personalities that clash like cymbals, sharpening focus yet injecting disdain, earning his final embrace of turbulence. Interiority concrete via embodied shifts like joy threatening to drown calculations. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany (“Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther”) borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via printing beats, pattern breaks when transposition reverses, CR closure lands on-page as flawed experiment reveals bidirectional flux with Cassian hollowed and stars vanished. Orientation anchored early in workshop and halo intro. Cost legible in final return to uncertain self.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Topaz walls pulse with current, reflecting vanishing stars, constraining choices via halo's light bleeding into press and mirroring internal states. Final matrix of light/shadow charges closure image. Sensory selective: pulsing heartbeat, groaning machine, copper shadows purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math emotion) tightens accumulatively via poet's overwhelming joy surge, narrowing to realization of non-linearity with hollow cost. Agency in persisting despite reversal forecloses linear solution path. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration vs. visceral embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as flux emerges organically from transposed clashes and halo mosaic, resonant CR reweights math premise without moralizing. Final star-borrowing image answers central question non-literally. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in open problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors (sine waves, damped oscillation). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compression purposeful in printing beats. No dialogue to judge; voice distinct and biased toward variables/equations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, rhythmic variety in clanking press amid lyric pulses. Minor artifact in repetitive “recorded” + equation phrasing (paraphrase loop across three instances) dulls mid-section slightly but misses closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress printing transposed empathy via halo math transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric turbulence heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in bidirectional revelation. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
