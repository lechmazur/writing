<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Master's motivation to decode narrative magnetism via pigment grinding shows consistent traits and intensifies through donor memories, earning transformation; interiority embodied in grinding actions and heart beats. Minor flaw: contemplative stasis limits contradictory impulses acting simultaneously until stranger's touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from daily ritual to stranger's visions and final realization; on-page CR reconfigures premise ("stories are not magnetized; they are given") with conceptual cost of abandoning formula for embodied attention. Orientation anchored early in tea house and valley; closure image of sun trails on dust seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house and valley mist constrain watchfulness and ascent; blue morpho wings as micro-setting charge choices, mirroring internal states via sun trails on ceramic and floor. Sensory hierarchy (iridescent light over others) reflects dye master's priorities, evolving causally with revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding story magnetism) signaled early, tightens via stranger's hand flooding memories, forcing stance shift under Accumulative lens; agency in sustained attention forecloses formulaic path with felt cost (staggering spin). One deepening suffices, cost legible in heart's foreign-to-familiar reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories held in bodily spaces emerges organically from pigment rituals, heart visions, and child client's words ("The light remembers"); final image reweights prior seeking without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in watchful endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in iridescent/light motifs; voice modulates poetically yet consistently, diction biased toward watchful observation. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("It is not the heart that draws stories"), distinguishing stranger's reed-like wisdom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in image-packed lines; purposeful motif repetition ("quietly explosive," "watchful") teaches pattern without loops dulling propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors during visions slightly blurs peak clarity, but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye craft, donor heart, and butterfly optics transforms mysticism trope into inevitable CR; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via iridescent constraints without gimmickry.</comment>
