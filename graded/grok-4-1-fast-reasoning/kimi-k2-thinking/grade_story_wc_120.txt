<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation clear and rooted in homesickness and symphony dream, with embodied exhaustion curling ankles pressuring micro-choices. Interiority concrete via memory mapping but borders on epiphanic in final desk return. Contradictory impulses show in acting before exhaustion claims her, earning small change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from desk scrolls to balcony climax via shell note echoing into harmonies. Orientation anchored immediately in spire and dawn. Closure as Charged Poise in storing shell before exhaustion, with legible cost in slipping time; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nautilus shell as micro-setting constrains choices (mapping, blowing, pressing) and charges final image in velvet box. Sensory details selective (ice groan, spire hum) mirror internal states through action. Glass spire and frozen lake evolve causally, guiding symphony via echoes and reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shell blowing to spire hum narrowing options. Agency in conducting gestures forces stance crystallization with visible cost in exhaustion's pull. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of past-into-present symphony emerges organically from memory mapping and ice sounds, reweighted in final desk return without moralizing. Final image (sun rising, music etched in ice) offers resonant non-literal answer to homesickness. Subtext in silence-to-song implications lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in spiral/musical noticing (wind whispers, ice cracks as notes). Voice texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character in poetic syntax. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in ending (repeated "conductor of unheard symphonies," "she smiled knowing") dull propulsion post-climax. Figurative density high but coherent in peak (shell as baton of light). Rhythms vary, but template echoes like "mirrored horizon" repetitions drag slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer, nautilus geometry, and ice symphony transforms tropes into inevitable poetic arc. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via exhaustion clock. No derivative echoes; particular images memorable.</comment>
