<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in the hand-on-switch hesitation, earning the final renunciation; micro-choices like testing the rope reveal values under pressure. Minor flaw: "credibly curious" label repeats thrice without full embodiment, slightly genericizing the trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with data density building to stall hesitation, delivering Charged Poise closure in the journal entry: "Zero hour is not when we sound the alarm, but when we choose not to," with legible cost of potential disaster if wrong. Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-kissed stone, humming instruments, and stiff rope constrain choices vividly; clouds churning below mirror internal doubt while charging the gap-opening image. Sensory selection purposeful, POV-biased toward wind's "confession."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warn or trust data) tightens via pressure-drop stall narrowing options to wait; agency in withdrawing hand from switch forces trade-off with village safety at risk. Escalation accumulates texturally to foreclose action path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening's wisdom emerges organically from instruments vs. siren, resonating in shutters-opened breath; final journal slightly on-the-nose but non-literal. Complexity in false alarm avoidance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("instruments' quiet song," "wind's true voice"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush under rising gusts. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/image; minor paraphrase loops in repeated "solstice hush" and "windblown sanctuary" (4x each) dull texture slightly but spare closure. No heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of alarm-tester trope via silence-as-action; bold lyric hush transforms solitary watch into earned stasis, inevitable from data patterns.</comment>
