<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marianne's motivation to magnify kindnesses roots consistently in her grief, shown concretely via dust-reading micro-choices; embodied emotions layer without therapy-speak. Final endurance of grief with reconfiguration earns closure cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust layers build density to CR closure in final image of filing letter, reweighting histories with conceptual cost ("eased not by healing, but by recognition"). Orientation anchored by para 1; ellipses motivated by research/letter. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust as micro-setting constrains discoveries ("dust on the envelope's surface was uniform") and charges final image ("histories, like dust, settle in patterns"); sensory selection (stale air, patina) reflects POV urgency. Vivid, purposeful economy elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor kindness in Marcus's file) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via button discovery/research/letter/response, forcing renunciation of full closure (posthumous). Cost legible in "emancipation from that belief." Lacks one agency-driven reversal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses persisting emerges organically from button/letter chain; final CR reweights premise without moralizing ("small kindnesses can unfurl across decades"). Resonant image avoids platitudes; earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (dust as "sentences," "map"); voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive to charged poise. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (dust/button) without muddle. Propulsion peaks in "She held it to the light"; final line recharges motif cleanly. Zero scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust-reading as history method transforms foster-care trope freshly; reflective structure risks but coheres under accumulative lens, heightening stakes via decades-spanning kindness. Inevitable synthesis in posthumous response.</comment>
