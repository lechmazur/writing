<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to chart discovery compels choices consistently, with sociable isolation as enduring trait revealing character under triumph; interiority concrete in pattern-noting but lacks deeper contradictory impulses in peak discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain from hopscotch pattern to phrasebook match to pursuit lands Resonant Reconfiguration closure in enduring isolation with felt cost of solitary strength; orientation anchored early in airship/chart room; single tightening via deciphering suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Airship's creaks, ozone, dusty deck board constrain noting action and charge final glow on carvings; sensory details (starling swirls, brass lantern) filter through cartographer's eye without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting luminance tightens via pattern pursuit forcing pilot commitment; agency in noting/deciphering narrows options with isolation as visible cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of diligent discovery amid isolation emerges organically via recurring starlings/phrasebook shifting to quiet strength; final carvings realization offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cartographer's perceptual bias toward patterns/lights; lyrical rhythm modulates from calm charting to triumphant hum; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in Kess's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies but repetitive "starling murmurations"/"sociable isolation" loops dull density (-0.4); figurative density coherent yet overwrought in opening without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-celestial clue transforms antique airship tropes into fresh pattern hunt; risk in quiet isolation payoff heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
