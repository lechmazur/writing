<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through actions like rerouting pipes; interiority concrete in engineering lens on "latent flows." Minor slips in label-speak like "functionally creative" prevent higher band without embodied contradiction in peak revival beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to communal pulse; CR closure in "equations...written in the flow of people" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of ships never launching. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via kids suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective ("popcorn scent...rusted metal"); roof and pipes constrain choices like panel alignment. Terminal-as-maze charges final image as launchpad.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect hope) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lights-to-kids deepening that narrows to communal stasis. Agency in redirects forecloses abandonment; cost legible in town's "lost...dream."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically from flows motif shifting to social equation. Final formula borderline echo but resonant non-literal answer reweights isolation to community without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with engineer-perceptual signature ("network of latent flows"); voice texture modulates poetically under revival pressure. No head-hopping; elision of details purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors like "heart a quiet engine" cohere without muddle. Minor "flows" repetition taught as pattern; no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering ingenuity resurrecting spaceport via sextant calculus; transforms abandonment trope through "hydraulics with heartbeats." Risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
