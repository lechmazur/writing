<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's pyramid scheme backstory anchors motivation to repay debts communally, earning the virtuous mischief in reprogramming the timer. Contradictory impulses show in obsession vs. owner warnings, with embodied shame transmuting at diamond collection. Final choice to fund expansion forecloses selfish path with felt resolve, but over-tidy epiphanies slightly dilute mid-crisis rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from glitchy messages to peak bloom surge, yielding on-page RR closure via crystalline crackle and final message with conceptual cost of reforged promises. Orientation anchors early (Kael in glowing cavern farm). One tightening at bolt turn narrows options; reflective shards cohere without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow and submarine console constrain choices (irrigation reprogramming, bolt hiss), charging final glint as porthole eye. Sensory hierarchy (blue pulse, substrate crackle) mirrors internal pressure via POV bias. Mushroom caps and mycelium evolve causally, avoiding white-room; recurring glow recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pressure to diamonds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via urgent messages to bloom-peak surge that forecloses failed past with communal gain. Agency in timer reprogram and bolt turn drives reversal, testing commitment; unauthorized risk as visible cost alters owner reaction. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of pressure/promises transmuted emerges organically from substrate crystallization and glitch collapse, reweighting pyramid vapor to stone in final fund image. Subtext in shadowseam (seam between shadows/wonder) lingers via ambiguity of parallel Kael without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; conceptual cost undeniable in reforged failures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (trembling fingers tracing luminescence, bolt glint). Prose texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, perceptual bias on glow/hiss character-specific. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, but minor register elevation in realizations drifts from raw survivor voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion in climax hiss/crackle, but paraphrase loops on "pressure/promise" (e.g., repeated transmutation in final third) and synonym churn (glow/whispering seam) dull closure image. Template cadence in reflective sentences ("He... knowing..."); figurative density overwrites peak without full payoff. Minor scaffold obscures rhythm but causality intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quantum promise via glitch messages crystallizing mushrooms into diamonds transforms pyramid trope into fresh alchemy of parallel intent. Virtuously mischievous survivor angle risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via bolt fulcrum. No derivative templates; shadowseam tone heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
