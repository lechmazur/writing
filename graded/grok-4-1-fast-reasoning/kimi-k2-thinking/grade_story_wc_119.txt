<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation to control her prophetic curse intensifies through concrete micro-choices like writing precise fortunes, earning her final self-directed change with felt conceptual cost; interiority is embodied and particular, as in flinching at cookies. Contradictory impulses act in scene (passive past vs. active composing). Final fortune for herself seals earned arc without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: specs discovery → matrix revelation → fortune orchestration → verified outcomes → self-fortune closure as Charged Poise/CR with legible cost (old self tides away). Orientation anchored early (lighthouse, pub, her backstory cue). Single tightening suffices; final image reconfigures options persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting (lamp mechanism click, Fresnel lens) constrains choices (hidden stone, kitchen mixer) and charges closure (beam directing flow, shell's spiral map). Sensory details selective via POV (salt air bleaching bones). Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curse to control) signaled early, tightens via specs-enabled agency narrowing passive prophecy to directed flow; one reversal (backwards playing to composing) forces trade-off with conceptual cost legible in self-fortune. Pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of composing/transposing fate emerges organically from particulars (fortunes as instruments, beam directing); final shell image resonantly reweights open secrets/microdot pattern without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cryptic futures as music/flow); voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, diction purposeful (e.g., "orchestrated it by directing flow"). Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Tomás's shell: "Found it on the ferry").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel momentum; purposeful music metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor overwriting in figurative density (e.g., "heartbeat of glass and brass") during setup slightly dulls early propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic cookies, Cold War microdots, lighthouse espionage transforms tropes organically; risk in fortune-as-instruction pivot feels inevitable, heightening stakes via island's open-secret fabric to charged final map image.</comment>
