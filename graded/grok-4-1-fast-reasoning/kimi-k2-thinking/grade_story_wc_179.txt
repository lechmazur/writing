<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid embodiment of scheming pacifist in pin transfer to Elara's palm, where demonstration compels release without force; minor abstract labels like "architecture of empathy" slightly distance interior contradiction from pivotal climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of shifts and pin iterations culminating in RR closure ("form began to dissolve... into potential"); cost legible in ongoing cycle felt at "weight in her pocket," with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary's pulsing organic walls and reality shifts constrain timing of grace moments, charging final image; silver breath motif anchors body as micro-setting mirroring emotional dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of convincing release tightens via cellular memory surge at pin press, forcing Elara's stance crystallization; cost in "resentment loosened, not undone" reweights options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grace as shifting, non-permanent emerges organically from pin's whole/broken cycles; final scheme summary ("heaviest chains... as grace demands") borders explicit echo, softening resonance slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "breath visible as silver motes" and glyph-dialogue sustains tight single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks at memory color/warmth without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("reappears when needed") taught early as pattern; minor paraphrase loops in resentment descriptions (-0.4) do not touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of cellular memory transfer and reality shifts transforms forgiveness trope; risk in abstract physics pays off inevitably at Elara's dissolution into potential.</comment>
