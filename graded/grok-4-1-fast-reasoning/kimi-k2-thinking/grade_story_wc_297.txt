<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (ancestral warnings vs. her drive to answers) act in the scar-pressing inciting moment and root-kneeling climax, earning her transformation with embodied cost in scars woven by tendrils.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from personal scar to collective roots, culminating in CR closure where clipping roots in palm reconfigures her as threshold, with cost legible in "root-bound no longer, she was the roots themselves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maze topiary clipping as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (tracing, pressing, offering) and charges final image of tendrils weaving scars, with sensory details like "leaves still warm with captured sunlight" mirroring internal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew covenant) signaled early tightens accumulatively via vision-deepening reversal at roots, forcing trade-off from personal to collective hubris; cost unmistakable in overwhelming merge during climax kneel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wild dream-tending vs. walled hubris emerges organically from scar/root visions, with final image of clipping-rooted palm offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights ancestral breakage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "future press against her ribs like a second heartbeat") modulates rhythm under visionary pressure; figure's "rustling leaves" voice fits mythic texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful nature metaphors builds propulsion, but figurative stacking in climax vision ("roots pulsed with dormant light... spreading, remembering") borders overwriting, slightly dulling peak immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars-as-portals and covenant renewal transforms visionary trope through specific root-merge, with risk-taking lush prose heightening stakes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from glade-maze pattern.</comment>
