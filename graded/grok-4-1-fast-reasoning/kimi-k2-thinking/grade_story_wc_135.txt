<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archivist's visionary trait and compilation drive propel choices from accepting valve to final demonstration; navigator's weeping reaction reveals relational crucible. Minimal internal contradiction shown dramatically, but endurance earns closure change. Interiority concrete via brine-scented hands and mist-sensing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: staggered blowings deepen revelations to Charged Poise closure in "pure silence that contained every story," with conceptual cost of exile reconfigured as composition. Orientation anchored early in harbor post-exile; one tightening at seventh interval suffices. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spray and mist as micro-setting constrain collection and valve resonance, charging final "spray write its first draft" image. Sensory bias via archivist's priorities (brine-paper hands, salt-crusted velvet); post-rain ivory stones mirror blank pages for inscription. Vivid, selective integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile absences into presence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intervals to demonstration reversal narrowing void into bridge; agency in summoning and playing forecloses exile's silence with felt emotional cost in navigator's tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as defining speech emerges organically from valve fragments and staggered sounds, reweighting absences without statement; final "every ending was merely a silence waiting for its key" offers resonant CR payoff, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mist/memory filter; poetic rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged in demonstration. Minimal dialogue natural ("this... remained"); no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops on "silence" and "fragments" (e.g., "absences... navigated like reefs," echoed in log, demonstration, final notes) dull late momentum; figurative strain in "bottled starlight" and repetitive "mist/spray" without pattern payoff. Propulsion strong early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of spray-archiving absences transforms exile trope via valve's negative spaces; fresh synthesis of mist-memory cartography feels inevitable, risking lyric over narrative without gimmick.</comment>
