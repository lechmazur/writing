<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vesper's motivation roots deeply in embodied ritual actions like kneeling and tracing patterns, earning her acceptance of transformed loss; contradictory grief-hope pulses concretely in the warming stone moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying pattern shifts to Charged Poise closure at the emergent doorway, with legible conceptual cost of unresolved mystery in "some mysteries are not meant to be solved, only lived."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's dripping stalactites and moonlit moss constrain the ritual, charging the final mosaic image; sensory weave mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, as roots "drinking the moon's silver."</comment>
