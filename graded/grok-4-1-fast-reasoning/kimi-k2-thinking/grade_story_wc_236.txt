<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under grief's pressure, like feeling the screw's warmth and closing eyes to receive differently; earned shift from control to translation feels character-particular. Minor slip in Marcus as wise-mentor archetype slightly genericizes his pressure on her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: Elena's realization reweights loss as translation, cost felt in "valve turning" chest shift and screw-as-talisman. Orientation anchored early in shop entry; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog, water clock, and screw as micro-settings constrain perception and charge final image—fog lifting mirrors internal release. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (trusts sight/sound/touch over absent smell); details evolve causally with emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sensory adaptation deepens via Marcus's adjustments and screw's history, narrowing to renunciation of control with legible emotional cost in shifted chest. Accumulative tightening via layered realizations suffices; agency in endurance/translation crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-translation emerges organically from particulars like oil viscosity and clock's "liquid heartbeat," resonant CR in final drop-by-drop inhabitation without moralizing. Subtext in occluded sensing invites ambiguity on miracles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Elena POV with perceptual signature of "occluded views" and biased noticing (dew-like oil beads); dialogue subtextual, goal-pursuing. Rhythmic modulation peaks in closure's quiet poise, voice distinct and lexicon-matched.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; metaphors cohere in watercolor/fog/water pattern without muddle. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs pre-peak, but propulsion clear and no loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapist in clock shop transforms grief trope via screw's birthing history and occluded senses; risks lyric accumulation pay off in inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
