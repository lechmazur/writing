<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via heartbeat and chest ignition, but epiphanies like "quiet courage stir beneath the fear" feel unearned without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; ferry guides apply mild pressure but remain stereotypical wise figures without flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from lost dog to realization; closure as Charged Poise in finding dog and ticket talisman reconfigures fear to possibility with felt journey cost; orientation anchored early in coast fog and leash snap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like salt-pine air and slippery stones purposefully constrain traversal choices; recurring lantern and fireflies charge final cove image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering dog/courage signaled early tightens accumulatively via ridgeway traverse and ferry crossing narrowing fear options; cost legible in persistent steps amid thorns, though opposition remains atmospheric rather than agency-testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistent courage emerges from particulars like star ticket reprise, but explicit articulation in guide's "Sometimes the courage we haven't used..." and ending "courage is always there, waiting" triggers thematic echo penalty, replacing image resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature in nature biases like "wind hummed a shoreline lullaby"; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing via guide's whisper without on-the-nose declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops of "shoreline lullaby" (7+ times), "gentle persistent" variants, and ridgeway paraphrases create template cadence and synonym churn dulling climax; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure propulsion despite varied rhythm elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fable premise of lost dog as courage quest transforms via ferry guides and star ticket into fresh synthesis; indirect routes and lullaby tone feel organic, though prompted elements slightly hedge boldness.</comment>
