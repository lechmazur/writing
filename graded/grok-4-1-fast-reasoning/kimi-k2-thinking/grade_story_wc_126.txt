<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via acoustic whispers and embodied pulse/heart-weight; micro-choices (collecting driftwood, sparking fire) reveal hierarchy valuing ritual over isolation. Final smile earns charged poise with cost of persistent hush. Minor abstraction in "understands... never truly over" edges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: silence pattern taught early, density tightens via fire/violin to RR/Charged Poise in "bowl... brimming with echo" with conceptual cost of enduring hush. Orientation anchored in opening lines; single deepening fractures hush without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shipwrecks supply driftwood constraining collection beat and resonate in closure hum, charging final image; bowl captures echo as micro-setting. Acoustic sensory hierarchy POV-specific; glass cracks evolve to drift melody.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind hush) signaled line 1; accumulative escalation via ritual layers (fire crackle → tale → violin → outward hum) deepens to reweight unfinished-as-promise with legible cost in "hush... accompanied by whisper." Protagonist agency drives without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring unfinished/cracks emerge organically to resonant non-literal closure in "magnificent simplicity... world reborn," reweighting hush without moralizing. Subtext in bowl's shift from empty weight to sound-vessel; no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third with acoustic perceptual bias (ghostly whispers, earth pulse); rhythmic swells match pressure from hush to "sound swells." Lyrical compression taught early, legible at violin resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats; varied rhythm breathes with scene (short spark sentences to swelling swells). Minor "She [verb]" stems in collection sequence purposeful for incantatory build, no closure muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn hush unbound by solo bonfire-violin in shipwreck greenhouse; lyric risk crystallizes in bowl-echo poise, transforming silence trope inevitably.</comment>
