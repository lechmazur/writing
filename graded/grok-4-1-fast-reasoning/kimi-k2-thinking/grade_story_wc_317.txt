<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to nurture oddities for puzzles is consistent and shown in planting, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied stress; interiority turns diagnostic with repeated vows like "safeguarding a space for innovation," flattening under-pressure revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density building to Charged Poise closure in seedling stirring and dawn light; orientation anchored early at brook; cost legible in patience for unknown bloom, though causal linkages thin beyond planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brook's flow and storm-born silence integrate tactilely, mirroring internal states and constraining planting; moonlight ribbons and leaf rustle evolve causally to dawn, charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of innovation via seed clear early, with one tightening as husk cracks narrowing to patience; abstract pressure lacks visceral test, as unknown sender and bloom yield no on-page trade-off beyond imagined puzzles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of orthogonal innovation emerges via seed/brook motifs shifting to "innovation...always finds a way," but line "true creativity thrived when problems were approached from orthogonal angles" echoes thesis overtly, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with puzzle-biased perceptual signature in scent/mirror imaginings; rhythmic texture modulates hush effectively, though minor repetition converges phrasing under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("storm born silence" x3, "hush of a possibility just born" x2, "orthogonal" x4) and synonym churn ("flow," "hum," "whisper") dull propulsion, obscuring closure image; template cadence in reflective sentences pervades final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower in escape-room innovation via pungent puzzles transforms mystery trope organically; risk in multi-sensory orthogonal designs heightens premise without gimmick.</comment>
