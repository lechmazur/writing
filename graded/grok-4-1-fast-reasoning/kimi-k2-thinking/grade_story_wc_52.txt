<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in carving (grief pulling memories while reclaiming presence) act simultaneously; final transformation earned by ritual's micro-choices with embodied cost in "warmth seep through the cracks of her grief."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from carving strokes to prism placement; Charged Poise closure in rainbow refraction reconfigures memory with conceptual cost of transience, legible in final lion-breathing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight droplet as "tiny globe that held the whole sky" evolves causally, mirroring internal states and charging final image; workbench and light constrain carving choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of harvesting loss deepens accumulatively through memory-evoking strokes and ritual completion, forcing trade-off from frozen preservation to fluid awareness; cost felt in "flicker that vanished when she looked directly at it."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges implicitly from carving/prism particulars, answered non-literally in "let it flow like water through the crystal of awareness"; no moralizing, resonance lingers in lion sentinel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sensory biases like "mane that curled like smoke"; rhythmic modulation heightens ritual intimacy without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines in carving beats; purposeful "here and gone" repetition teaches pattern but minor loops in "rust-hued peace" paraphrases slightly dull late propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystallized time ritual transforms grief trope through grounded carving/quartz synthesis; fresh inflection in prism rainbow reweights premise inevitably.</comment>
