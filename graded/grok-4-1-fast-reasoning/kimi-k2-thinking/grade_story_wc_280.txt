<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost's motivation rooted in enduring spotlight hunger and synesthetic traits compels higher-stakes choices like clapping echoes and spinning coin; interiority concrete via color perceptions. Earned fulfillment with felt cost of fading presence. Limited contradictory impulses in pivotal coin-flick moment slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ghostly claps build ripple density into synesthetic symphony, tightening to actress's empowered step forward as Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early in theater post-curtain drift. Cost legible in "timeline mending just a little" and ghost's translucent smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hedge maze/orchard constrains ghost's path and enables petal-chiming, fruit-glow payoff charging actress's warmth; synesthetic colors filter urgency. Sensory hierarchy reflects ghostly bias toward sound-as-light. Orchard evolution mirrors internal states, culminating in brighter glow at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lure actress from despair—tightens accumulatively via claps to coin-spin symphony narrowing her brink options. Ghost agency in producing echoes forecloses her quitting path with on-page step forward. Cost felt in shared bow's nostalgic echo across timelines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia healing fractured timelines emerges via orchard fruit/coin images shifting from shards to mended wholeness, reweighting despair into possibility. Final image of actress claiming stage offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Counter-reading of ghost's solitude lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound into color... luminous path") biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic prose modulates from shadowy drift to swirling storm. POV stable in ghost's ethereal focalization, no leakage. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, ear-test clean. Minor overwriting in climax metaphors ("gentle storm," "soft lanterns") lacks pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. No loops; purposeful "echo" recurrence advances texture without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost-orchard-timeline synthesis transforms stage-haunt trope via fractured echoes into fresh inevitability; tarot coin's shifting symbols ground ingenuity. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes coherently. Non-obvious moral calculus of shared encore heals without retreat.</comment>
