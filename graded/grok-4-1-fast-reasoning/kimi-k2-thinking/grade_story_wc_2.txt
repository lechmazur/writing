<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly from clock repairs to pattern-chasing and climactic jamming, with embodied fear ("screamed, metal grinding") revealing contradictory certainty; final self-mending earned via prior struggle, but closing epiphany ("mended herself") borders tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as clock pattern accumulates to compass pull and underground discovery, tightening at improv jam with legible cost in mechanism's scream and imperfect reset; CR closure reconfigures certainty premise via spinning needle image, constraint shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse leaves/drafts and underground waterfall/gears constrain path and climax choice, with sensory spray/stone mirroring internal falter; recurring ashes/compass integrate via action, charging final unlocked doors image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend pattern/embrace uncertainty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing certain repair to improv risk; agency in jamming forecloses perfection with felt grind/scream cost, though one live option (abandon) undramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of certainty-as-ash emerges organically from clock pattern and water-quartz song, reweighted non-literally by imperfect clocks/spinning needle; grandfather quote anchors without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "live within" stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (clocks as "small universe of gears") modulates rhythmically under stress, compression taught early via patterns; stable close-third POV biases toward tinker's priorities, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("jammed the compass rose... screamed"), varied rhythm/syntax; minor overwriting in metaphors ("frozen tears", "sings together") slightly muddles peak without obscuring closure, no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean heart-clock and time-compass premise synthesize clocks/grandfather myth freshly, riskily blending lyric pattern with tactile improv; irreplaceable reweighting of admiral relic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
