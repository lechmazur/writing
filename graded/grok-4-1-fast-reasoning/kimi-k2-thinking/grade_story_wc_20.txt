<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in regret for boy and her own name's failure, embodied in "sang in her teeth" and micro-choices like heating the coin; final renunciation of search earned by alchemical progression with conceptual cost of recognizing limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of zodiac names tightens to coin's transformation as CR, with legible conceptual cost in "dissolve into light" reweighting absence as redeemable recognition; orientation anchored early in foundry post-search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (copper-smell, embers pulsing) constrains choices like quenching in rainwater; foundry's final exhale charges closure image, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redeeming absence via names deepens accumulatively through speaking zodiac syllables narrowing to coin dissolution; agency in alchemical acts forecloses search path with felt cost of her signed failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of names as cracking vessels emerges organically from kintsugi parallels and zodiac ritual; final image of golden shadow offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature via alchemical bias (concrete "remembering hardness"); rhythmic control heightens mystical pressure, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (cracks/gold rivers); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor density in name-speaking risks overwrite, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi mysticism and name-weights transforms alchemical tropes; risk in "factually mystical" lyric closure feels inevitable and heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
