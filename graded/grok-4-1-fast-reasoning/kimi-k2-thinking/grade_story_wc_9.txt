<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in ritual actions like tracing the hand and unfastening hair, revealing contradictory impulses of perplexity and recognition; earned change in accepting bodily transformation as closure. Minor diagnostic edge in "cloudbound repentance" realization slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ink-tracing to saucer-weeping to CR closure; orientation anchored immediately in glade/persona; cost legible in "luminous burden" and foreclosed path of seeking external vault.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Midnight glade and micro-settings (saucer crack, mist tablecloth) constrain ritual choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (visual ink/light, tactile mist/hair) reflects cartomancer's perceptual bias; evolves causally with events like shivering trees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming lost time deepens accumulatively through ritual reversals (crack weeps, clock reverses, body as archive); agency in micro-choices forecloses external search with conceptual cost in self-theft acceptance; pressure coheres without dilution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time loaned/transformed emerges organically from particulars like crack-as-body and hand-tracing custom, reweighting motherhood in CR ending; subtext in "choking beauty" images avoids moralizing until late near-statement "crack was how the light entered," which resonates but borders overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in onyx/mist diction and rhythmic modulation; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure image; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with incantatory propulsion, but heavy figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "beauty rose choking," repeated crack motifs) creates minor coherence drag and paraphrase loops on "lost time" accumulation; high info density but overwriting obscures some micro-causality without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy and postpartum time-loss via ink/body metaphors transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes through irreplaceable glade rituals.</comment>
