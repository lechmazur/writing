<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's interior conflict between father's arson legacy and her compassionate choices is embodied in scar imagery and bird-grafting micro-actions, earning the final redemption with visible cost in "the weight of her father's legacy lift, just a little." Contradictory impulses act in scene via measured movements against dark inheritance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from sand/coin/thread to bird's chirp and scars "shimmer," landing Charged Poise CR where final image reconfigures legacy with felt endurance cost in walking away carrying symbols. Orientation anchored early in lagoon/Maya; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through Maya's attuned perception: black sand warms palm, kelp scent breathes peace, constraining choices like protective circle and driftwood splint while charging closure image of shimmering scars amid orange rays. Sensory hierarchy matches calm urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to redeem legacy via compassion signaled early, tightens accumulatively through grafting action and bird's response narrowing despair-to-hope options; cost legible in partial legacy lift forcing endurance. Agency in binding/singing drives deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars singing via compassion emerges organically from grafting, song, and bird chirp reweighting fire's legacy without statement; final image offers resonant non-literal answer tying particulars to redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature in breeze-attuned breaths and scar-as-strings noticing; rhythmic diction modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines integrating sensory/character beats; purposeful scar-sing motif avoids loops, though minor motif density in closure nears overwrite without obscuring image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire-scarred firefighter grafting bird wing with father's coin transforms redemption trope via lagoon's textural logic; risk-taking lyric compression heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
