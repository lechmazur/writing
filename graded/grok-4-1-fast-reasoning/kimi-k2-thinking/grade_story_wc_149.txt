<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied reactions—breath hitching, heartbeat syncing with bead, tears burning—reveal contradictory grief and triumph; ghost's traits compel the central choice without unearned epiphany. Final mourning of unknown love earns stasis with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ghost cameos build density to bead placement as decisive change, delivering resonant reconfiguration with orchard's rebirth. Emotional cost legible in "mourning the loss of a love she never knew, yet rejoicing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's frosted panes, twisted vines, and ancient tree constrain climax action, evolving with "luminescent tendrils" to charge final glowing image; sensory chill-to-warmth mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard salvation stake tightens accumulatively through fleeting appearances, narrowing to placement agency; emotional price in tears and fused bead forecloses prior darkness without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Love as "poison and cure" emerges organically from bead's memory pulse and ghost's debt; final "sweet bitterness of a love that had finally found its rest" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with botanist perceptual bias (vines, fruits, tinctures); lyrical rhythm modulates ghost dialogue's subtextual venom, sustaining immersion without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density weaves action and image without loops; purposeful motif repetition ("hush of winter-cracked fields") builds texture, but minor synonym churn in descriptions slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen-veil ghost bride repaying alchemical debt transforms gothic tropes through bead's memory resonance; poetic synthesis feels inevitable in orchard rebirth.</comment>
