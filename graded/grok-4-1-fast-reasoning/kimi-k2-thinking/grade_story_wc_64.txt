<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to decode and honor clear and intensifies accumulatively, embodied in stained fingers and resolve; lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making gardener more vessel than conflicted individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising from tangled threads to revealed pact; CR closure at "Intentions... woven into the very fabric of silence" lands on-page with legible cost in "gentle weight... pressing against his chest."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid and purposeful, cobalt silo as micro-setting constrains intimate decoding and charges final image with star-pulsed rhythm echoing tapestry; spatial choreography clear without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding signaled early, one meaningful deepening via pattern reveal reweights knowledge under accumulative lens; cost felt in foreclosed simplicity ("demanded more") and pressing weight, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken intentions emerges organically from tapestry particulars, final web image offers resonant CR without moralizing; complexity lingers in ambiguous forgiveness plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature selective via tender noticing (frayed threads, dye stains); rhythmic control strong but minor POV certainty overreach in picturing weaver unearned by scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dull propulsion (verbatim "weaver's fingers... silent vow" twice, "velveteen gloom"/"uncharted echoes" churn x4 each); overwriting with mixed metaphors in peak decoding obscures closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-chess cemetery ritual into tapestry intentions elevates familiar grief trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
