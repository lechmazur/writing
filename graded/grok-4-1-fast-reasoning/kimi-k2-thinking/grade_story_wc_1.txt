<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract realizations like "Kael realized his purpose might lie not in the pursuit of vengeance, but in the quiet pauses," lacking contradictory impulses acting in scene; unearned epiphanies weaken the final resolve without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from frost patterns to furnace discovery, landing Charged Poise closure in the glowing vessel; cost felt in tucked ledger/resolution vs smugglers, but convenient resonance-follow lacks causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost patterns and canyon walls vividly constrain choices, guiding to chamber as cryptic map; recurring glittering frost charges final glass image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs smugglers) signaled early but escalates abstractly via realizations, not agency-driven turns; wound and ledger provide felt cost, but no on-page reversal narrows options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of forging purpose from pauses emerges organically through frost-glass motifs, resonating in final vessel; repetitive assertions like "purpose in the pauses" border on echo, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual bias toward light/resonance patterns; rhythmic modulation suits reflective tone, though occasional purple drifts from POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("quiet canyon under stars," "drifting resonance," purpose variants repeated across paragraphs); overwriting with metaphors in reflective peaks dulls propulsion, artifacts touch closure vessel beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frost-ledger code and glass legacy synthesize fresh angle on survival epiphany; lyric risk in resonance motif heightens quiet stakes without gimmick.</comment>
