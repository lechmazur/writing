<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chef's contradictory impulses peak in refusing to erase the daughter ("that was a cruelty beyond bearing"), earning the subsumption choice with embodied cost in trembling hands; interiority particular via taste ("metallic, cold, undertones of stale bread and ash"). Minor diagnostic phrasing ("remorse so dense it had its own gravity") avoids peak deduction as embodied soon after.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building via pool tracings to final insight ("precise moment when choice becomes fate"); Charged Poise closure in "brittleness spreading" reconfigures with legible cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (fortress, chef role, woman arrives); single scene with legible descent transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coral pavilion constrains choices (pools as memory architecture) and charges final image ("sighs, its pools draining"); sensory hierarchy chef-specific (salt crystals, waterlines via touch/taste). POV-filtered details evolve causally (pink stalactites drip as remorse thaws).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free woman of remorse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from first pool taste to final analysis narrowing options (erase vs. share); agency in touch pulls cost visibly ("weight nearly drove me to knees"). One tightening sufficient, cost unmistakable in "heart heavier."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared burden emerges via particulars (daughter's hand ghost in bread), resonant non-literal answer in final kneading image reweighting "sandpapered not into absence but into something...held." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in vessel risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (memories as flavors/patterns) stable, rhythmic control modulates pressure (short sentences in droplet catch); minimal dialogue natural ("Show me"). No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (taste/geometry motifs taught early), varied rhythm supports propulsion; minor overwrite in pavilion beats (metaphors in most sentences) slightly dulls peak without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; read-aloud flows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, fossilized remorse in tidal coral transforms tropes organically; risk in brittle vessel premise inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via contagious touch payoff.</comment>
