<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alia's machinist expertise drives concrete micro-choices like adhesive analysis and floodgate redesign, earning the council proposal with embodied tension ("heart quickened"). Contradictory impulses surface in doubt-rippling assembly amid tremor. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("encrypted compassion... shared heartbeat") borders diagnostic but ties to prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifacts build to deciphering (causal pivot) then council presentation, landing Charged Poise closure in final harmony image with tremor-cost legibility ("stones groan"). Orientation anchored early in volcano amphitheater. Single scene with summary construction shard fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain's breath recurs as constraint, guiding flow and charging final image ("mountain breathed again... affirming harmony"). Sensory hierarchy (sulfurous sigh, stones groan) filters through Alia's machinist bias, evolving with events. Micro-setting (chain, envelope) shapes decoding choice without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize preservation/profit) signaled early, tightens via council doubt and tremor reversal, forcing proposal agency under accumulative lens. Cost legible in "ground tremble" and foreclosed discord path. One deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing past/future emerges via chain/message particulars, resonating in "shared heartbeat" CR without direct moral. Subtext in mountain's breath mirrors internal arc. Minor overtness in final lines edges thematic echo but avoids sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (breath-language, oil-stained hands). Lyrical rhythm modulates pressure ("slow, rhythmic breath" to "low rumble"). Sparse dialogue (murmurs, frowns) carries subtext; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dense figuratives ("dappled like sunlight... lantern in twilight") overload high-pressure council beat, mixing metaphors without pattern payoff (-0.6). Minor synonym loops ("heart quickened... heart a quiet tremble"). Propulsion strong overall, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: adhesive-decoding machinist trick transforms archaeo-mystery into floodgate blueprint in volcano setting. Risky poetic tone heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Chain's symbols-to-mercy pivot feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
