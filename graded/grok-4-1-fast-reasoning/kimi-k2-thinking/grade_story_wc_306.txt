<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict between hired conscience and personal certainty shown in embodied cloak weight and mirror void mirroring self-doubt; keeper's presence forces micro-choice to unhook lantern. Final renunciation of tight cloak earned by prior tension. Minor epiphanic summary in "I realized that being a conscience for hire did not mean being infallible" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs densify to closure CR as mirror fills with spectrum and cloak loosens, reweighting certainty with conceptual cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early in campfire-to-lighthouse climb. Single scene causality intact via chimes prompting unhook and ascent; cost legible in "wear it more loosely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse and dawn light constrain choices (wait for chimes, tilt shard for spectrum); sensory hierarchy via wind/salt/chimes reflects doubt. Subtle mirroring of internal via prismatic walls vs void. Climax charged by gallery chimes and spiral stairs choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (certainty vs nuance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clashing chimes and keeper's "unhook the certainty" to Charged Poise ending. One tightening: discordant chimes force pull despite uncertainty, foreclosing rigid path. Cost felt in looser cloak as soft armor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges organically from shard/cloak/chimes shifting meaning; final image reconfigures premise without literal moral. Keeper's "Welcome nuance into certainty" echoes but integrates via action. Late "truth is never a single note" borders on thematic echo, flattening subtle resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent first-person perceptual signature biases toward nuances in chimes/light; poetic rhythm modulates with wind's "discordant melody" to "symphony." Keeper's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; voice sustains allegorical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("hollow mirror shard" exact 4x, "cloak of doubt"/"wind chimes" paraphrase loops) creates template cadence across reflections, dulling final third closure image. Some overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "pale eye blinking against the bruised horizon"). Density high but scaffold drags momentum in reverie beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh allegorical synthesis of conscience-for-hire with prismatic symbols transforms doubt tropes into lived paradox. Risky lyric closure via campfire bookend heightens stakes. No derivative echoes; particulars like chime language feel inevitable.</comment>
