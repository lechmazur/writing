<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seren's motivation roots in vigilant expertise turning revolutionary, shown concretely in lock-picking translating sundial degrees to tumblers; micro-choices like measuring kegs reveal value hierarchy with competence balanced by patient risk in blackout. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but endurance forecloses commandant's control path with felt institutional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density of shadows/gears/locks building to Charged Poise closure in "every door unlocked... his own bronze seal betrayed him," with legible conceptual cost of subverted control; orientation anchors early in fort/twilight/blackout; one tightening via cradle discovery narrows to precise signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Phosphor shadows and half-painted sundial constrain decoding choices and charge final sundial reset image; sensory selection narrows to tactile lock-oils and phantom gunpowder under POV urgency; micro-setting of magazine doorway and quill gears lived-in via goal-directed tracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silent revolution signaled early via intrigue, tightens accumulatively through sundial-to-cradle decoding forcing precise charge calculation; agency in inventive measurements forecloses explosive path with tactical cost of whisper-signal only; pressure coheres to commandant's betrayal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of control subverted via observation ("every shadow to be read") emerges organically from lock/gear patterns reweighting to "freedom disguised as malfunction"; final quill image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of planted possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in lock-centric noticing ("oiling... tumbler sequences"); rhythmic texture modulates from hushed intrigue to charged dawn poise; no dialogue, but purposeful compression of discoveries legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (gnomon shadow traced to tumblers), but minor paraphrase loops on "silent revolution" and "winking hush" thrice dull late momentum; rhythm varies, metaphors consistent (rust/intrigue), no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms lock maintenance into sundial-quill-powder revolution via non-obvious gear-angle code synthesis, inevitable in hindsight; risk of quiet subversion heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
