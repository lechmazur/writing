<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petra's contradictory impulses—dogma vs. etched mercy—act simultaneously in her decision to broadcast memories, earning the final reconfiguration of purpose with the felt cost of detached certainty at "stone heart... quickened with something messier."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density building to CR closure ("no truth was ever singular") with conceptual cost of rigid certainty's collapse legible in the dome cracking and garden blooming; anchored early in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's eastern crack constrains Petra's threading action and charges final image of roots "cracking the dome's certainty wide open"; sensory details (currents, silt, violet light) filtered through stone POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve verities vs. embrace nuance) signaled early, escalates via protagonist agency in mind-reaching/broadcasting under Accumulative lens, with tightening in "shudder of recognition" foreclosing dogmatic path; cost unmistakable in foreclosed certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges organically from foxglove poison/cure duality and Petra's arc, with resonant CR ending ("Welcome") reweighting premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in stone faces' "slightest hint of doubt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (telepathic silt-like cascades, stone embodiment); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, prose as character in "dream in the way only stone can."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (foxgloves, threading) taught as pattern; minor metaphor density in peak revelation cascade ("silt through water... dissolving") risks slight overwriting but propels without loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living statue telepathy with foxglove ambiguity transforms trope of guardian awakening; risk-taking in decades-spanning CR heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from ampoule setup.</comment>
