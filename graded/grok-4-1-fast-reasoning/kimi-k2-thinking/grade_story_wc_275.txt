<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices reveal Lyra's pacifist traits under pressure, like inviting the stranger despite risks; endurance of peace feels earned through routines. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal stranger or storm beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via vignettes to Charged Poise closure in final dome image, reconfiguring chaos into continuity; orientation anchored early in dome/rose farm. Stranger visit and storm provide one meaningful cadence shift tightening stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring objects like sandbag scrap and iron disc constrain choices (counterweight, talisman) and charge final altar image; sensory details (petal curls, burlap texture) selective and embodied. Desert dome subtly pressures via trembling glass and filters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity escalates accumulatively through stranger's intrusion and storm, forcing endurance choices with felt cost in unscathed roses; one deepening via quiet's shield suffices. Agency in sheathing knife crystallizes stance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inculcated peace emerges organically from petal-singing and object rituals, culminating in resonant final image of glowing dome as sanctuary reweighting chaos. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in world's endurance lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (noticing petal shifts, sandbag weight) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from calm routines to storm tension. Brief stranger note carries subtext without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of "quiet" and textures propels accumulatively; rhythm varies read-aloud without loops, though minor figurative overlap ("quiet fire," "perfume a quiet fire") in opening slightly dulls peak storm beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc pacifism via value-inculcating roses transforms tropes; bold tranquil tone amid chaos heightens stakes organically. Final objects' reprise feels inevitable from early setups.</comment>
