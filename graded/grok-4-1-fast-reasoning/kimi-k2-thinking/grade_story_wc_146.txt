<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in Kael's patient endurance against entropy, embodied in his memorized gaits and rhythmic mimicry; actions align perfectly with traits. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, relying more on atmospheric telling than micro-choices under live pressure. Final endurance earned but without pivotal internal scene-conflict, slightly limiting 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from listening to fork-strike convergence to step-by-step reconfiguration, with on-page Charged Poise closure ("cobblestones...shifted imperceptibly...town began to rebuild") reweighting silence-to-possibility. Orientation anchored early (archway, Thornhaven by para 2). Cost legible in "another century, perhaps two," shaping final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (humming stones, wind-breath, subsonic waves) selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's vibrational perception; cobblestones/archway constrain choices and charge closure image. Micro-setting (fork, stones) mirrors internal rhythm quest. Environment evolves causally with footsteps, no white-room; 9+ test met via archway amplification forcing convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance pre-collapse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fork-draw of gaits to rebuilding pattern tightening options against entropy. Agency in Kael's counterpoint walking forecloses collapse path with felt time-cost. One decisive deepening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes ("shared balance") prevents 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-over-entropy emerges organically from footsteps/chimes motifs shifting to resurrection, resonant in final "ghost town breathed" without moralizing. Subtext in cryptic vibrations invites ambiguity on patience's price. Protagonist arc inextricable; 9+ test met as ending reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations over words, rhythms as architecture). Prose texture rhythmic and voice-motivated, modulating from hush to exhale; no head-hopping or withholding. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; minor elevated diction slips under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy steps in convergence, breathing cadence at end); high density integrates image/action. Minor artifacts: "infinitely patient" paraphrase loop (twice), hush-motif churn slightly dull high-pressure buildup. No closure harm, scaffold minimal; propels accumulatively without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost town trope via sonic architecture/footstep memory—fresh, inevitable synthesis grown from particulars. Bold risk in abstract mechanism heightens stakes without gimmick; final reconfiguration ("step by step, memory by memory") feels original and charged.</comment>
