<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic trait drives contradiction between doubt and action, earned in final softening of skepticism; embodied in pulse acknowledgment and mural creation despite questioning legends.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from tile discovery to mural transcription; closure as Charged Poise in Lira's softened skepticism and tile fade, cost legible in "her own skepticism softened by the courage of kindness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower walls constrain mural choice and charge final sanctuary image; whale vibrations and nautical charts filter through Lira's stargazer priorities, evolving with mural.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock tile for fisherman tightens via pattern mapping and night transcription; agency in painting forecloses solitary skepticism, felt cost in effort and personal change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of felt truths emerges organically from merging whale-song patterns and memories; resonant in final star-gazing image, but repetitive "unheard symphony" borders echo without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in whale vibrations and tile pulse; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build, minor convergence in repetitive phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in "unheard symphony" (10+ echoes) and ending redundancies ("tower now held space," "sculpted space") dull propulsion; overwriting muddles peak mural reveal with stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as memory conduit with whale migrations and star charts transforms mythic tropes; risk in lyric accumulative closure pays off in sanctuary reconfiguration.</comment>
