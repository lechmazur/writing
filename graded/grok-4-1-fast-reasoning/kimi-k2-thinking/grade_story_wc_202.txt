<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to honor histories intensifies via grandmother's memory surge when thumbing fragment, compelling journal reveal; interiority concrete in embodied pulses and scents. Internal conflict mild, with harmonious impulses toward preservation rather than contradiction acting simultaneously. Final keeper realization earned by prior micro-choices like tracing canvas.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory layers and image pulses builds to CR closure in "I became the bridge," reweighting translation role with conceptual cost of eternal keeping. Orientation anchored early in market and role; one scene with legible descent transition. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final pocket hum echoing keeper's note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity sharp (sulfur-spice wind narrowing to salt-time brittleness under intuition pressure); market sway and canvas constrain discovery path. Recurring rope bridges/stalls evolve with descent, mirroring internal fusion. Body as micro-setting: thumb-trace and palm-pulse charge journal latch click.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring histories) signaled early, tightens texturally via fragment-canvas merge breaking hidden pattern to journal defiance. One deepening narrows to keeper mantle, with felt cost in "weight of an eternal instant." Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of indelible light/memory emerges organically from fragment pulse and Elias's map note, resonating in final "light never dies" image without statement. Subtext in alchemist's nod implies shared keeper burden; ambiguity lingers in ongoing translation duty. Protagonist arc fuses with theme via pocket anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable, perceptual bias toward "whispers of lost cities" and pulsing glass selective/character-specific. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in descent hum; minimal dialogue natural ("such anchors... sacrifice"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via elisions pays in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("eternal instant" x3, "pulsed" variants x4, "between childhood and now" x3) create redundancy, dulling closure propulsion; synonym churn in fragment traits ("shimmered... sigh... elusively tangible"). Overwriting with unchecked metaphors in peak reveal (glass merges paint) mixes vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm varies but template cadence in reflections drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fantasy market synthesizing ghost-translation and lighthouse defiance transforms memory trope via tangible intuition anchor; canvas-latch ingenuity feels inevitable from brushwork cue. Bold lyric accumulation risks poetic density but heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
