<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Knight's hesitation before stepping through the doorway reveals contradictory impulses between withdrawal and infinite pull, earning the guardian transformation with binding cost; embodied "shivering bliss" particularizes emotion effectively throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density cadence from vine-pruning discovery to cosmic reconfiguration; CR closure lands on-page in Aldric's vow and step with allegiance cost legible in "binding the bearer to the shifting truth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse's pulsing roots and silver vines constrain inciting discovery and charge final image of breathing cosmos; sensory selection (luminescent fruit, harmonic song) mirrors mystical urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping isolation escalates via pattern-tracing agency to vow sacrifice under Accumulative lens; one tightening in thread-pull forecloses prior life with felt binding cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of possibility-from-isolation emerges organically from puppet-map and orchard shift, reweighted in CR final image of infinite dance without moralizing; ambiguity in "both puppeteer and puppet" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (rhythmic light pulses, warm puppet surface) modulates intensity; consistent diction suits mystical texture, though minor convergence in repetitive bliss phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("shivering bliss" x3, "endless night" x4, silver/light synonyms) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion, especially in climax cascades; overwriting muddles peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marionette-program-as-pattern-map ingeniously transforms alchemical knight trope, synthesizing isolation into cosmic guardianship with fresh "unsnap" risk that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
