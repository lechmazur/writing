<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal shadow integration via stitching reveals contradictory impulses—violence in withholding medicine vs. loving care—earning final renunciation of escape with embodied gravity-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds stitch-density to circuit completion and door-opening RR; "she turned back to the Compassion's Tear" lands stasis-choice with legible purpose-cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled gravity generators constrain psyche-bonded integration and final hull-stitching choice; ship's "molecular tape" decay charges closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stitch-accumulation under accumulative lens escalates shadow confrontation, forcing agency-tradeoff of transcendence for ship's need at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tapestry-circuit and final hull-stitch reweight premise—dimensions as embodied perspectives—with undeniable cost of eternal caretaking, emergent without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("stars hung like unanswered prayers") coheres in close third, modulating ethereal compassion under integration pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density rhythm propels stitch-beats with coherent metaphors; no loops, varied syntax charges "gravitationally light with purpose, heavy with love."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Psyche-gravity bond and tear-stitching synthesize pacifist myth into inevitable dimensional mercy; bold premise-risk elevates without gimmick.</comment>
