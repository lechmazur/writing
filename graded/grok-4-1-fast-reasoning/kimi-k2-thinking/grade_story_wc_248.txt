<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "volcanic tenderness erupted... aimed only at their own past cowardice," driving micro-choices like sketching; earned change from arsonist to guardian with felt guilt cost. Minor label-speak ("analytically intuitive") slightly genericizes interiority but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tapestry find to mural trail, culminating in Charged Poise RR at vault discovery and weeping portrait, with legible cost in eternal guarding. Orientation anchored early in volcanic foothills; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via dawn-angle skylights for coordinates and mineral mining for pigments, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (sulfur/paper, bioluminescent glow) mirrors intuitive perception. Volcanic fissures evolve with action, integrating purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through tapestry recognition deepening to cipher trail; agency in portraying reweights past complicity with weeks-of-work cost legible in final endurance as librarian.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive creation emerges organically from arson-to-art arc, resonant non-literal answer in weeping self-portrait weaving truth/forgiveness; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "scholars... point to the weeping portrait."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (mathematics in warp/weft, Fibonacci progression); rhythmic control modulates from patient tracing to fervent strokes, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "each stroke a confession and a birth"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts in peak beats like ochre portrait; minor figurative density ("humid breath") purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-redeemer via geometric art-cipher in volcanic archive; "volcanic tenderness" inflects tone uniquely, risk-taking in accumulative mural trail heightens stakes organically.</comment>
