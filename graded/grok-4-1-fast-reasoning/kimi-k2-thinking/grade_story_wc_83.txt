<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief in "feel in her teeth and bones" and shaking hands during pool discovery reveal contradictory impulses of exhilaration and loss; final smile as earned stasis forecloses extraction path with survival's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to pool find; charged poise closure in geode-to-window refraction reconfigures unused potential into remembered witness with conceptual cost of unlived lives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Breakers' cooling and tremor-dampeners groaning constrain 20-minute hunt window; geode's vibration charges final image, filtering all setting through Kael's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping potential tightens via algorithm's scream and time pressure, forcing renunciation of extraction; cost legible in hands shaking and non-violent witness choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Geode motif shifts from shattered novelty to crystallized ghosts, offering resonant non-literal answer to unlived possibilities without moralizing; final beams on skin recharge prior grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "quantum imprints, each fracture a memory" taught early sustains biased noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in discovery without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "nudged reality just enough to make it confess" propels without loops; purposeful "bleak exhilaration" recurrence avoids artifacts, varying syntax accelerates climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sci-fi grief hunt via geode perturbations transforms drone-strike trope into fresh quantum haunting; risk of lyric stasis over action pays off in inevitable CR closure.</comment>
