<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tutor's guilt embodied in chest pressure during verse pause compels resolve, with contradictory impulses (past blindness vs. renewed vow) acting in decoding scene; final pawn acceptance as earned stasis forecloses exile path with relational cost via girl's hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as thread density and thunder pulse build to key discovery and village release; Charged Poise closure lands on-page when labyrinth dissolves during teaching, reweighting guilt with conceptual cost of continuous forgiveness felt in dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tapestry threads constrain decoding choices as chess moves, charging final dissolution image; thunder lull and platinum shimmer selectively mirror internal pulse, with time-frozen cobblestones grounding spatial coherence without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption signaled early tightens via verse's sacrifice demand, narrowing options under accumulative lens; protagonist agency in winnowing drives release, with legible cost in self-confronted past pressing climax teaching beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Forgiveness theme emerges organically from chess-thread parallels and pawn reprise, with final dawn image offering non-literal reconfiguration of guilt as mendable pattern; ambiguity in "continuous winnowing" lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in chess-notated fidgeting; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to awakening flow, with girl's sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in hope reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "winnowing" and "fierce repose" dull mid-decode density without pattern payoff; overwriting in stacked metaphors like "stubborn shadow" and "heavy shroud" risks coherence in high-pressure verse reveal, but propulsion holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chess-labyrinth synthesis transforms exile trope via thread gambits unlocking time-stasis, with fresh infidelity calculus in king's sacrifice verse; risk-taking in accumulative hush-to-breath cadence heightens redemption stakes organically.</comment>
