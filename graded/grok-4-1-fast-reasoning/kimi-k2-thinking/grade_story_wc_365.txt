<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in the "familiar tug" versus "stronger, urgent" pull during the weave, earning the final acceptance of guardianship as compass with embodied chest-weight cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to CR closure in "redirected the surging energy... into the shard's glowing heart," reweighting the cycle with conceptual burden legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring dust-buried shard and cracked concrete constrain the rift-weaving choice and charge the sanctuary final image, with sensory hierarchy (metallic taste, pulsing rhythm) filtered through Lira's mapping bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to seal rift tightens via predecessor realization during urgent pulse, forcing redirect agency with felt cost in "weight... now a tangible presence," coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclic guardianship emerges organically from shard-predecessor's warnings to final "compass" repricing, resonant without statement; lingering ambiguity in shard's return invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sensory-map perceptual signature ("tasting the metallic memory") modulates rhythmically under stress, teaching lyrical compression early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in weave beat ("invisible threads stretched... threading through unseen dimensions"); minor metaphor density in opening risks overwrite but serves voice without obscuring climax.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory-map maker premise transforms multiverse trope through predecessor-shard echo, with fresh "cyclically spontaneous" pattern risking bold lyricism that inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
