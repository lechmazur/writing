<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via shadows coiling boots and intuitive impressions settling; Kael's micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy. Boy's forward step as pivotal courageous anomaly earns relational change with felt cost. Minor diagnostic slips like "courage meant mapping empathy" slightly abstract pivotal motivation without fully embodying contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via mirror impressions to RR closure in crystal reformation; boy's blood vaporizing into light legible as conceptual cost with before/after reconfiguration. Two clear shards with legible transition hold drive without ambiguity. Orientation anchored early in orchard and floes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing fruit, frost-etched windows, and mirrors constrain choices (knowledge via reflections) and charge final orchard humming image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's calm intuition narrowing to shadows and crystal pulse. Details tactile and POV-biased, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant floe-prediction stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through mirrors revealing blood cost, forcing volunteer choice that forecloses inaction path. Boy's trembling palm crystallizes agency with on-page price altering community tactics. Escalation coheres via deepening knowledge without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Empathy-as-action emerges organically from boy's step and crystal memory, resonating in final lighthouse beam without direct moralizing. Particulars like willing blood shift motif meaning non-literally. Minor explicit lines ("empathy must become action") tension subtext but integrate into scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadow-lacing and intuitive listening; rhythmic modulation heightens mirror scene compression. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden in Kael's soft snowfall voice. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in blood vaporizing beat. Minor loops in "weighted breath" repetition and shadow motifs purposeful under textural lens. No scaffold or figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors-for-knowledge and blood-empathy crystal transforms magic tropes via lived orchard peril. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently. Final shadow-resting image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
