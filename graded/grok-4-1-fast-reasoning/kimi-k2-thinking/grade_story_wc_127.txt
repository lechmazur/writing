<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in embodied static prickles and faint affection stirring amid detachment, with contradictory impulses (professional distance vs. subtle resonance) acting in the transformation scene. Micro-choices like testing the blend reveal values hierarchy. Client as secondary applies minimal crucible pressure, but single-POV baseline met exceptionally; earned endurance of detachment with residue cost visible in final reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory buildup (amber light, static hum, drip echoes) and holds to Charged Poise closure: narrator's lingering hum reconfigures their observer stance with conceptual cost of perpetual half-measure empathy. Single continuous scene anchored by ~50 words (grotto, dusk prep). One tightening via transformation completion narrows to residue question, paid off on-page without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk vividly selective (honeyed light pooling, resinous scent thickening, stone bench/drip constraining ritual choreography), mirroring internal states (pulsing walls sync heartbeat). Recurrent static-charged objects (vial, petal) constrain dosage choice and charge final touch/hum image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward electric potency; no white-room, evolves causally to fading light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver synthetic empathy, probe personal fusion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via density shift: prep sparks → inhale → softening/jaw/tears → residue hum, forcing endurance crystallization under textural lens. One deepening (transformation syncs breath/eyes wet) forecloses apathy path with felt client cost and narrator's oblique price. Agency in dosage adjustment; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of counterfeit empathy via half-truths emerges organically from petal delivery and fading residue, with subtext in silences/gestures (hesitant inhale, cracking thank you). Final image (static quieting to patient wait amid city lights) offers resonant CR repricing premise—fusion forever borrowed—reweighting without moralizing. Complexity in narrator's ambiguity lingers honestly; no tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature via static-sensing bias selective/embodied. Voice texture poetic-rhythmic (moth's wing, haloed silhouette) modulates intensity without drift; whisper dialogue natural/subtextual (fragile sincerity). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens in observation beats, inference calibrated to senses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short drip-measured sentences to flowing reflections), density high with multi-job lines (e.g., "spark leapt... confirming readiness"). Paraphrase loops on "half truths"/"fuse insight" motifs (−0.6; purposeful but churns in reflections), minor template stems in prep beats (−0.3); no closure touch, metaphors coherent (tide subsuming apathy). Propulsion strong sans artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes synthetic emotions with static-sensing craft, transforming dealer trope via blotter/static/half-truth logic into fresh frame. Risks affectionate detachment tone heightening stakes (residue temptation) without gimmick; final hum reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
