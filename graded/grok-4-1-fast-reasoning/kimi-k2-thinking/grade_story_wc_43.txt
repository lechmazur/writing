<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's decisively kind motivation drives micro-choices like placing the shard and humming mundane sounds, earning the reconciliation with felt cost in the narrow window. Internal conflict subtle in her unflinching grief-facing; embodied via palm-held shard. Minor slip: Mr. Harrow's reactions lean gestural without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from blood work finality to humming tapestry, culminating in Charged Poise RR as Lena presses shard to ear and hears echo, reconfiguring silence with relational cost legible in "years of silence cracked."</comment><question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elara's bias: vinyl scent/performance mingles with IV drip/ventilator hum, constraining reunion tactics; solarium light catches shard label, charging final image. Micro-setting (shard, room sounds) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunify for flawless goodbye) signaled post-blood work; textural deepening via interwoven mundane sounds forces Lena's stance crystallization at shard-listen beat. Agency in Elara's hum alters family options; cost felt in fragile duet/fragile voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented continuity emerges organically from shard/sounds bridging silence, reweighted non-literally in "broken record was whole again" without moralizing. Subtext in Lena's hesitation/ice-crack implies earned complexity over tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in hymning lens (e.g., "click of a pill bottle... quiet litany"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hum-weaving. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("We'll let the music carry..."); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy hum lines vs. flowing descriptions); high density integrates action/image. Overwriting flaw: figurative density ("poem of finality," "gentle architecture," "spun glass") clusters in opening/setup without pattern payoff, dulling early propulsion; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms hospice reconciliation via vinyl shard as auditory bridge and "hymning mundane" method, inevitable in hindsight from blood work stakes. Risky lyric texture heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
