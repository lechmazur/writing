<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via tingling somatic marker and geode's warmth tying to grandmother; affectionate skepticism shown in eye-roll at news yet proceeding with plan. Minor slips in label-speak like "affectionate skepticism" feel diagnostic without full contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with resonance density building from static shock to fractal tree closure (Charged Poise/CR reconfiguring doubt to hope with conceptual cost of softened skepticism). Single scene oriented early; one tightening via hum/vision maps pathways.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Studio vividly anchors via acetone smell, canvases, metal table constraining actions like dust placement and software sketching. Geode/table as micro-setting charges final image; sensory hierarchy fits Lina's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map pill chaos tightens accumulatively via resonance flare narrowing to disruption clue; agency in tapping vial/dusting geode forecloses doubt path with felt thumb pain cost. Escalation driven by her choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of patterns revealing hope emerges organically from geode/pill resonance; final fractal tree offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting skepticism without moralizing. Subtext in softening doubt via particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fractal/resonance noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from caution to optimism. No dialogue; purposeful poetic diction fits lyric accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("fractally precise" x4, "hidden pathways" x5, "somatic marker" x3, "willowglass hope" x4) create paraphrase churn dulling peak resonance beat; synonym density and template echoes ("tingled," "glow") trigger -1.2 artifact penalty. Rhythm varies but overwrites propulsion in mapping sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geode resonator + nanotech pill + light-painting maps transforms tropes; risk in fractal/somatic method feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable particulars like mica lattice.</comment>
