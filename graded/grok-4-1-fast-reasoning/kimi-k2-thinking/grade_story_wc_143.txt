<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority embodied in breath-fogged visor and steadying kneel reveals curiosity under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance of melancholy feels earned yet lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hush density builds to grain fall; on-page CR closure in "bloom began to wilt... sun erased it forever" reconfigures preservation with conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring hourglass/vial constrains timing choice throughout; shadows "stretched like fingers toward the east" charge final image, with sensory hierarchy (crunch, glow) reflecting urgent POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture bloom) signaled early tightens accumulatively via grain fall narrowing options to flare; cost legible in wilting petals post-click, crystallizing acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile impermanence emerges organically from capture-wilt arc; final "dawnlit melancholy" offers resonant non-literal repricing of space age limits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "purposefully curious gaze"; rhythmic hush builds to flare burst, modulating effectively under dawn pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image seamlessly; minor paraphrase loops in repeated hush/grain checks (−0.4) slightly dull mid-build without harming closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar bloom and chemical hourglass transforms sci-fi tropes via timed impermanence; "crystalline bloom flared into a brilliant violet" risks poetic ingenuity organically.</comment>
