<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait drives contradictory impulses, embodied in "felt each failure as pressure behind her eyes while her face remained calm," earning the final renunciation of hope with visible cost in lightness of burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of approximations to Charged Poise closure: snapping crozier reconfigures failure into frozen blooms with conceptual cost of incomplete peace legible in "never quite ash, never quite flame."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus and crozier constrain pivotal choice (grinding shards into embers) and charge final image (frozen blooms pulsing), with sensory selection narrowing to blue embers and green flames under twilight pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to vivify via approximation escalates accumulatively to agency-driven snap of crozier, foreclosing certainty with on-page cost in "sensitivity crack like ice," reweighting destiny.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vivifying failure emerges organically from particulars like penny and glass tree, offering resonant non-literal answer in final silhouette dissolving into frozen bloom, reweighting hope as trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in alchemical bias ("frozen stars," "sweat green flames") and rhythmic control modulating to crystalline compression at "Vivify, she whispered."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through metaphors like "tree of frozen glass," but minor −0.3 for repetitive "hopeless" echoes in final third slightly dulling closure image without obscuring it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical failure into "beautiful undeath" transforms tropes through irreplaceable frozen blooms, with risk-taking poetic compression heightening stakes inevitably from particulars.</comment>
