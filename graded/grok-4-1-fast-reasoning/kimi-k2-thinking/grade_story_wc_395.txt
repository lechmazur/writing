<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover deleted files intensifies through discoveries but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete in patch warmth yet abstracts to "sensed absence" without embodied crisis conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as numbers/songs density deepens pattern to CR closure in final upload and patch-holding image with defiance cost; orientation anchored early in archive humming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Patch handled tactilely ("frayed...warm, as if it held the heat of the crash") constrains as talisman and charges final image of hope amid shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake to expose hidden truth escalates texturally via numbers forging path to vault/video/upload; forging token and log erasure show agency with legible corporate risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistent truth emerges from numbers/patch/songs particulars; final "sensed absence felt...less hollow, a little more like hope" reweights absence non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias to data patterns; rhythmic motif repetition ("echo of forgotten songs") taught early supports accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("echo of forgotten songs," "numbers," "sensed absence") repeat across final third, creating template cadence and dulling closure propulsion; synonym churn in ghosts/silence obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Digital ghosts via numbers encoded in songs offers fresh persistence angle; transforms cold case trope through archive logic, though Lost-numbers echo tempers boldness.</comment>
