<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sam's contradictory impulses—honesty vs. survival math—act in scene through casing and moral shift, earning the final ethical algebra with visible cost in accepting lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure: ink pot discovery reweights premise, with conceptual cost in Sam's liquefied rigidity legible in "seven more lies would buy them freedom."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prep room's embalming machine and ink pot constrain timing/breach and charge final image; sensory details (wheeze, gurgle) filter through Sam's math-biased POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair trade math for asylum) tightens via agency in breach and photocopy choice, with cost in foreclosed honesty charging the ledger handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of deception-as-survival emerges organically from ink pot/ledger particulars; final "ratio that kept a soul intact" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in math metaphors; sparse dialogue carries subtext in director exchange, advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion; minor metaphor density in peak reflection ("liquefies rigid thinking") purposeful but borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con family in funeral home yields inevitable ink pot twist; risk in math morality heightens stakes organically.</comment>
