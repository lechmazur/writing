<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in hesitating over cloth amid nostalgia versus facts, embodied in "raw pang"; earned change via pinning cloth forecloses nostalgia-only path with visible cost. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("insulating her emotions with numbers") slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with echo motif density tightening to Charged Poise closure (pins cloth, reconfigures echoes as "possibility"); cost legible in "hollow" to "smile" shift. Orientation anchored early; no shards, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Valley/quarry trailer vividly constrains isolation/reflection, charging final image ("echo of the valley fill her"); sensory hierarchy (rust smell, wind echo) mirrors internal echo motif purposefully. Micro-setting (trailer desk) enables pinning decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via cloth discovery and Dale exchange narrowing to renunciation of pure facts; cost unmistakable in wrestling nostalgia ("raw pang"). Agency in micro-choice to keep cloth forecloses safe appraisal path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of echoes transforming loss emerges organically from cloth/appraisals, resonant in final "every ending is a prelude" without moralizing. Slight overtness in "turn the echo of applause into a new rhythm" borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in echo-filtered noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from hollow to poised. Brief Dale dialogue natural, goal-driven (tests value), distinct from internal lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but echo/silence paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "echo" across paras) and minor synonym churn dull propulsion; no closure touch. Varied syntax supports quiet escalation.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie-to-appraiser pivot via speaker cloth/echo motif transforms nostalgia trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
