<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Collective "they" lacks individual interiority, contradictory impulses, or embodied micro-choices under pressure; ghost's altruism told without flawed actions or visible costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via message pattern to bell climax as RR/Charged Poise; closure CR in "final chalk mark: a spiral" reconfigures hope with ghost's fade as cost, though summary softens scene causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches constrain discovery and guide mist to reservoir in pivotal "droplets spiraled upward" beat, charging closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard survival stake signaled early tightens accumulatively to bell ring foreclosing doubt; collective agency and ghost's fade deliver legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilient communal hope emerges organically from chalk motifs and bell action; spiral image offers non-literal resonant answer to tangled path.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical collective POV stable with distinct perceptual texture in mystical diction; purposeful modulation suits accumulative emotional build without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, but repetitive phrasing ("collective effort" x3, "strangely trustworthy" x2) creates minor paraphrase loops dulling peak density around bell scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh sci-fantasy synthesis of ghost fable and planet ecology transforms communal tropes; chalk-spiral turn feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
