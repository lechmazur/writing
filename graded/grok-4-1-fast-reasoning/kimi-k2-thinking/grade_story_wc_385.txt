<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to learn/preserve echoes roots consistently in perceptive traits and intensifies to personal loss, compelling final vow; interiority concrete in shell/canyon perceptions but summarizes contradictions rather than dramatizing simultaneous impulses during crescendo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from general echoes to personal revelation, landing CR closure in "her song, woven into the webs of intrigue, ensured that no echo would ever be silenced" with legible emotional cost of melancholy acceptance; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sighs of stones" and "starlight filtered through the cracks, painting silver threads" filter through POV and constrain singing method; canyon evolves causally, charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover echoes tightens accumulatively via conspiracy then lost love reveal, forcing purpose crystallization with deepening melancholy as felt cost; agency in progressive notes narrows to keeper role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as resonant wounds emerges organically from shell captures and canyon chorus, reweighted in final "every echo has its origin, its story, its end" without moralizing; ambiguity of universe's indifference lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in noticing "faintest rustle of invisible wings"; lyrical rhythm modulates from melancholy notes to peaceful tide recede, maintaining biased diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("reed-blown melancholy," "serpentine nexus," "universe hummed its secret song") across final third dull propulsion and create paraphrase redundancy in closure beats like canyon's "final sigh"; overwrought figurative density muddles peak realizations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of acoustic preservation and personal grief transforms echo trope through shell/canyon mechanics; bold lyrical accumulative risks heighten resonant memory premise without gimmickry.</comment>
