<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in haunting question compels journey and mural evolution with embodied wonder, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws driving on-page mistakes to complicate the smooth path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from postcards to cathedral revelation (self in glass) delivering CR closure with legible emotional cost in "quiet reckoning"; mosaic shards taught early via whispering postcards, transitions legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (honeyed light, cold glass, silver star) filtered through artist's gaze; etched glass and pavilion recur to constrain revelation and frame final mural image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why flowers bloom at night) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at glass revelation narrowing to personal mirror; agency in journey/return, cost felt in heart's layers but minimal external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden layers/dark invitation emerges organically via jasmine image shifting to self-portrait, offering non-literal CR resonance that reweights question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (light/shadow biases) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation suits quiet intensity, elisions purposeful for textural build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "quiet reckoning/night-blooming" variants, end-paragraph pavilion restatements) and synonym churn dull density; overwriting muddles peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh self-referential loop (artist in cathedral glass mirroring own mural) transforms artist-quest trope via layered glass ingenuity, risking poetic circularity that heightens thematic charge.</comment>
