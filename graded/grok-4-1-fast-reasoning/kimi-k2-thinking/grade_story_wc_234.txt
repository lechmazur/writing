<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemist's motivation to capture presence roots choices like vial selection, with Kael's relational pressure forcing micro-turns; embodied emotions thicken during ritual, but interior conflict favors poetic summary over raw contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure at vial sealing ("resolve crystallizing"), with conceptual cost legible in "settle into her bones" reweighting existence; single scene anchors orientation early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus and twilight constrain ritual timing, pocket-sun echoes in palm-bloom; vial as micro-setting charges final image, sensory selection (glow, hum) mirrors internal density without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture presence) signaled early, ritual mixing as deepening under Accumulative lens narrows to crystallized resolve with felt cost; agency in indigo choice forecloses relic status.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><grade><comment>Theme of revaluing via return emerges organically from shell-ritual, vial image offers resonant CR; explicit whisper ("We revalue the past...") borders thematic echo, docking score without final-para harm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with alchemical perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("How do we return differently?") advances goal, voice modulates rhythmically without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites ritual beat (e.g., "stars breathed... ink into water" in most lines) without crisp pattern payoff; repetitive loops on "density of presence"/"revalue"/"return differently" create paraphrase churn across final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical fusion of presence/revaluation transforms relic into lens, risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; shell-vial synthesis feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
