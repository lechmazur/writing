<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract diagnostic labels like "noctilucent reckonings" dominate interiority without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation clear but epiphanies feel unearned, lacking simultaneous impulses in pivotal pond scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to pond realization as Conceptual Repricing; closure reconfigures mundane as prism with felt cost of acceptance in "heart a tempered pane"; orientation anchored early at Pearl Bay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pond and prism atrium constrain insight and charge final image, evolving from mist to gold; sensory details selective through glazier bias, mirroring internal refraction without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating mundane tightens accumulatively via pond ripples, narrowing to acceptance; agency in stone toss, but abstract pressure lacks visceral cost legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of mundane as luminous emerges organically from glass-water motifs, resonant in final teaching image; undermined by explicit echo "secret to a perfect pane was not in the cutting, but in the seeing" articulating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with glazier-specific perceptual signature (cracks, ripples as stories); rhythm modulates reflectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on insight ("clear complexity," "luminous design") across final third dull closure; "prism atrium in mist" repeats 4x without pattern payoff; overwriting muddles peak pond beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft with pond ripples as decision maps transforms mundane reflection trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
