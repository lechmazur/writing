<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's rogue charm shines in the "charming smile" and cryptic deflection to auditors, with embodied thrill of "linguistic subversion"; minor label reliance like "charming rogue scholar" slightly under-shows via action alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure in auditors leaving thwarted by chaos—"detectors flickered, confused"—reconfiguring defiance with felt risk cost in "system...tightening like a vine".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's "living chaos—bees, beetles, pollen"—constrains auditors' detectors in climax, charging final ladybug image; sensory hierarchy via Aris's botanical bias vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebellion tightens accumulatively via seed plant → bees → auditors' arrival, forcing cryptic endurance; cost legible in risked exposure during "door slammed open".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts as wild territories emerges via insect codes, resonating in final "seed would rattle with...freedom" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with cryptic perceptual signature ("botanical metaphors"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in "aphids...candid" exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "cryptic/candidly" slightly dull mid-beats; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought-tax dystopia via insect pollen ciphers transforms surveillance trope organically, with risk-taking in Garden Cant Club payoff.</comment>
