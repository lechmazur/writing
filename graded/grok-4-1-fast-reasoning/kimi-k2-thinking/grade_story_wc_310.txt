<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory enthusiasm and stellar doubt act simultaneously through embodied reactions (teeth ache from static) and micro-choices (recasting with new question), earning the final alignment with persisting cost; no unearned epiphanies, though some traits border label-like repetition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via static patterns to voice ("Align yourself") and final coin mandala; on-page Charged Poise closure ("she had found the alignment") reconfigures stance with undeniable conceptual cost in persisting stellar doubt and eternal drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber deck and coins provide tactile constraints (creaks, cool forehead press, spins on deck) that charge final glow and dissolution image; selective cosmic sensory details mirror internal frequency quest without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align or dissolve) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via interference patterns and coalesced voice forcing stance crystallization; agency in question-shift recast narrows options with felt cost in doubt's endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reverse causality and honoring loss emerges organically from coin casts and static dialects, resonant in final CR ("Having been, she will be") reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity of choice lingers potently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct cosmic perceptual signature (static as dialect, wavelengths in bones); rhythmic modulation builds to silence, purposeful compression taught early fits lyric mode without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops on "doubt" and "static bursts" (e.g., repeated in final third) slightly dull peak without obscuring closure image; metaphors consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic lyricism transforms prophecy trope via frequency motifs into inevitable CR; bold risks in reverse causality and stellar doubt heighten stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
