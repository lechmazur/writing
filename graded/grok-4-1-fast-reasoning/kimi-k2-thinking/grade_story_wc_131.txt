<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's embodied sense memory (phantom vibrations, tasting coal smoke) and methodical caching under isolation pressure reveal contradictory impulses toward visibility and retreat; final smile earns endurance with visible cost in her hidden life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as caching pattern builds to boy's discovery ("He turned it over, confused, then curious") and reading, delivering Charged Poise closure with legible isolation cost in "her methodical heart kept time with his words."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pipe chases and steam pipes constrain Mara's tactile navigation and charge final vent observation; sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) mirrors her priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility via caching tightens through outage-enabled placement and boy's pocketing/reading, forcing endurance trade-off with emotional cost in ongoing retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quiet visibility theme emerges from caching particulars, reweighted non-literally in final image of boy's "small but steady" voice syncing with Mara's hidden pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with tactile perceptual signature ("sense memory was her language; touch was how she read the past") modulates rhythmically under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through lyrical compression ("sapphire-hush moments"); no loops or artifacts dull closure image of "coal smoke" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller premise transforms hidden helper trope via sense memory synthesis, with risky quiet closure ("Either outcome was a kindness") heightening stakes organically.</comment>
