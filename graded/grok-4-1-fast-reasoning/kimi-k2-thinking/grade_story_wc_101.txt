<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's persistence shown concretely in kneeling to boy and declaring stories earns endurance; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal declaration scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with ritual density increasing to RR (Charged Poise) at Mara's vow under sanctions; orientation anchored in opening arbor/ridge; one tightening via stories amid storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arbor, ridge, and bell constrain gatherings/signals and charge final hum image; sensory details like moonlight shadows selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sanctions dominant stake deepens accumulatively via food-to-stories shift and storm test; Mara's agency in declaration forecloses isolation path with persistence cost legible in "tightening the belt."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unbreakable solidarity emerges from grandmother's tale and festival; final bell hum reweights memory's power non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with hopeful perceptual bias; rhythmic texture in phrases like "whisper among the weary" modulates pressure; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive "quiet" and "silver bell" phrasing accumulates tone but creates minor synonym loops in final third; high density otherwise propels via varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh ritual synthesis of bell/food/stories transforms sanctions exile trope; intergenerational bridge via anonymous runs feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
