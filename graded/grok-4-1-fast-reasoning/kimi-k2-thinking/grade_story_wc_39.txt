<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied actions like winding the box with a paperclip and feeling sound's weight press her chest; motivation to translate generations intensifies via jar-filling, earning her reconfiguration from vagrant to rooted conduit. Final change credible with felt cost of "richer poverty." Contradictory impulses subtle in preserving vs. releasing, shown in solstice opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single melody to symphony of bloodline voices, culminating in CR at solstice jar-opening where sand dances names and wind carries poems. Orientation anchored early (loft, dunes, dawn). Closure cost legible in "invisible architecture of sound" rooting her life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral loft and dunes constrain discoveries (collapsed bookshelf, rotting ladder) and charge final image (sand dancing patterns, jars glowing as stars). Sensory details POV-filtered (ink-stained hands, damp corners whispering). Micro-setting (jars, music box) evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (glean redemption via preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through jar accumulation and chest-pressing weight to solstice release narrowing vagrancy option. Agency in coaxing box, sealing jars, opening all; cost felt in transformed poverty. Pivotal solstice tightening forces communal stance with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sweetening loss via preservation emerges organically from jar actions and motifs (honey/rust melody, pollen from dead flowers), reweighting prior fragments in final wind-carried verses. Resonant CR: past sweetens present without moral statement. Complexity in richer poverty avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (world's silence into verses, notes staining page) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from introspective to symphonic at solstice. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final image. No dialogue; diction character-specific and biased toward poetic translation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (melody "tasted of honey and rust") integrated into action, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking at "sand began to dance." Zero artifacts dull closure; sensory propulsion clear in jar condensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-preserver via sound-jars transforms abandonment trope; music box discovery and jar method offer non-obvious angle on memory. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at solstice reconfiguration. Bold tonal shift to communal without gimmickry.</comment>
