<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poet's molt trait drives contradictory impulses, embodied in shaking hands shelving Whitman; earned choice to anchor as guardian shows hierarchy of values with cost of prior selves shed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from sorting to network to molt; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in slipping seed-poem into sonnets, reconfiguring options with felt continuity cost versus monthly shedding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted library under stars constrains choices via scavenged nails and painted quotes, charging final image of "rusted cathedral"; recurring rust/stars mirror internal anarchy-to-beauty without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging beauty from anarchy tightens via library rebuild narrowing despair options; agency in choosing poet voice during molt forces trade-off, with visible cost in passing tin before release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from seed-poem and blooming wildflowers cracking pavement; final image of Cora reading to new inmate offers non-literal resonance reweighting anarchy premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual bias toward silver light and rhythms; purposeful compression of motifs like "moon cleared the skyline" modulates intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with motifs like rust/stars advancing texture, but minor paraphrase loops in repeated "coffee tin with secret false bottom" details dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Molting personalities synthesizes fresh angle on change/resistance, transforming prison trope via poetry seeds; risk of accumulative lyric heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at tin-passing.</comment>
