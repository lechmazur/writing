<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's meticulous traits drive concrete micro-choices like tracing the tube and whistling for the pigeon, revealing contradictory impulses (chill yet resolve) embodied in steady hands amid pursuit risk. Interiority particular via data anomalies and warning recall, earning the release as credible endurance with target cost. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak integrity nurturing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pursuit, data patterns, courtyard pause builds to Charged Poise closure in pigeon release and resolute walk, reconfiguring purpose with legible target cost ("mark him as a target"). Orientation anchored early (rooftops to courtyard by ~100 words). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (slick tiles, fig rustle, dew) filter through Elias's priorities, guiding lateral drop and release in courtyard sanctuary. Weather (dusk dew, rain drops) mirrors internal shifts, charges final image (face to sky, sirens). Courtyard as micro-setting constrains reflective choice productively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose quarantine via data) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via intuition of lab and release despite pursuit, narrowing to solitary integrity trade-off. Agency in whistle/toss forecloses silence path with felt cost (isolation, sirens reminder). Escalation coheres under lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of solitary integrity vs concealment emerges organically from data protection and release, resonating in final rain-washed defiance image without moralizing. Subtext in "storm’s eye" note and pigeon silhouette reweights truth's fragile cost. Complexity lingers in target acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (barometric precision in dew/pressure notes), rhythmic modulation (short toss sentences to lyrical dusk fade). Lyrical texture purposeful for tone, no head-hopping or withholding. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("stillness settle," "still air," "quiet courtyard"; "layered tranquility" twice) and synonym churn in reflective ending dull density, especially final third. Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., multiple rustle/murmur). Closure image clear despite overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm data obsession, rooftop evasion, pigeon dispatch transforms quarantine trope via "storm’s eye" lab intuition. Lateral progress and courtyard poise feel inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens resolve without gimmick.</comment>
