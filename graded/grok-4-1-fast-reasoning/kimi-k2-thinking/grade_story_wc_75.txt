<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to rescue arts compels ritual baking and lens use, with contradictory triumph-dread embodied in "chest tighten" at harp's note. Micro-choices like loaf circle reveal values under engineers' warning. Community as secondary pressure coheres without overwhelming Liora's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from silent hives to harp's note, with closure as Charged Poise: music echoes but "beekeeper's absence still hung" as felt cost in final image. One tightening via lens-melt ritual holds causality; orientation anchored early in grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "rosewater scent" and "limestone walls" constrain choices (shaft of light for lens). Waterfall spray mirrors internal dread, evolving to "honeyed hope" charging closure; micro-setting (ice river, murals) guides thawing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts via thaw) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through ritual to lens melt narrowing options against "permanent" curse. Agency in baking circle and focusing ray forecloses inaction with lingering dread cost legible at "shadow that no single act could fully dispel."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultural rescue amid loss emerges via thawing harp shifting ice-encased silence to fragile music, reweighting prior dread without statement. Final image ("whisper a name, and the harp would answer") offers resonant answer to preservation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Liora's perceptual bias (UV signatures in murals); rhythmic prose modulates from damp echoes to shivering strings. No dialogue, but voice texture distinct and pressure-tuned without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; purposeful "rosewater dread" recurrence builds texture without loops. Minor paraphrase in final resolutions ("fragile hope") doesn't dull closure image of whispering to harp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual loaves and opera lens thaws curse in grotto, transforming loss tropes via irreplaceable details like initial dough conduit; risk in symbolic literalism heightens stakes to charged closure.</comment>
