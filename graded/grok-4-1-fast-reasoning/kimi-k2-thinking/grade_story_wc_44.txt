<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in rune-tracing under pressure, with actions aligning to seal shadows. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete but surface-level, no deep flaws complicating peak choice like final loop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via successive rune loops narrowing shadow channels to closure RR (Charged Poise in sealed ticking heart, balcony confirmation). Orientation anchored early; cost legible in "sealed awakening...thrashed" against her effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating isle and observatory constrain rune angles and moonlight precision, charging final balcony image with no shadows. Sensory details (hum, glinting brass, flickering shadows) vivid and POV-filtered through scholarly priorities; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal shadows, solve noon riddle) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via brighter core and thinning darkness per loop. Agency in deliberate tracing forces trade-off at final reversed serpent; cost in automaton shudder unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate mastery over fractured chaos emerges organically from rune loops and shadow sealing, resonating in journal as preserved knowledge. Final image reweights premise: shadows "curled peacefully" answers riddle non-literally with conceptual security cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rune observation; rhythmic diction modulates but some register elevation in descriptions. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "quietly deliberate" (4x) and paraphrase loops (shadow vanishing/sealing restated across final third) create template cadence, dulling climax surge. Density good but artifacts obscure propulsion in peak rune-tracing beats; minor synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spoons-fractured world, shadows slipping to automaton dimension via ouroboros loops feels inevitable and risks bold world logic. Transformation of rune scholarship trope through precise, grounded sealing elevates beyond template fantasy.</comment>
