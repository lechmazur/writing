<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait compels endurance at rupture despite proofs warning collapse, with contradictory impulses in "grim optimist... catalog every way... still believing"; final step earns stasis via prior dice micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to dice double-sixes triggering rupture; Charged Poise closure lands with cost in "stepped forward, not through... letting the glitch fade," foreclosing hospital return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Infinite staircase's self-healing geometry constrains mapping and resting; "flickered like a corrupted pixel" charges rupture image, mirroring internal regret texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to escape regret texture tightens at rupture narrowing options; agency in renunciation forecloses path with cost felt in bypassed "hospital corridor, smell antiseptic."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of stepping onto "next solid step" with dice as "constant reminder" reweights premise non-literally, answering that regret texture is carried imperfection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature filters via math bias ("0.003% favor," "micro-variations"); rhythmic compression heightens "dice clattered and both came up sixes—impossible."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "proved that perpetual motion required perfect symmetry, and perfect symmetry always concealed one fatal flaw" propels without figurative muddle at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chipped die bias navigating infinite asymmetry synthesizes math proofs and regret into inevitable stasis; risks surreal physics and conceptual closure heighten stakes organically.</comment>
