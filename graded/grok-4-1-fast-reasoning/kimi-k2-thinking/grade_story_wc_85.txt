<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Guilt embodied concretely early ("weight of unspoken words press against his chest"); internal conflict between forging others' pasts and his own erasure drives micro-choices like descending steps; final renunciation earned by plaque discovery with felt scar of regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sifting builds density to plaque (inciting tightening), yielding CR closure in decision to cease forging and final watch-hand image reweighting time/memory with conceptual cost of reclaimed narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings and shore constrain sifting choice, selectively mirroring internal fragmentation; cobalt terrace bookends as witness, charging final reckoning image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth to quell guilt) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via carving traces to plaque reversal narrowing denial options; agency in search yields visible cost of career cessation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unforgeable memory emerges implicitly from particulars like driftwood "broken sentences"; final image non-literally answers via mended watch-hand, reweighting premise with tempered regret cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature ("sieved hush," weight motifs) biased to regret; rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "weight" loops (unspoken words, chest, truth, collapsing wall) and "sieved hush" paraphrase churn across middle beats dull density; template cadence in search sentences hampers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Black-market genealogist premise fresh, transformed via personal erased-history quest; driftwood carvings and watch-hand synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
