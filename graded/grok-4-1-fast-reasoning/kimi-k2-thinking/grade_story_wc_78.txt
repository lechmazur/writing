<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation to transform threats shines in precise strikes and endurance of wandering life, earning the final smile; lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal dubbing beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound layers densify into shared storm resonance; Charged Poise closure in "true instrument... space between forecast and creation" lands with conceptual cost of perpetual drift, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood ring and kelp-wrapped mallet constrain precise strikes and charge final fading resonance image; sensory details (salt spray, apple shivers) filter through prophetic priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save orchard) signaled early, escalates via rhythm layering that narrows to storm mimicry under textural lens; cost in precision demand and endless drift felt at crescendo, entering 8.8+ via trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of threat-as-dialogue emerges organically from sound-cloud mirroring; final image reconfigures "obstacle into instrument" non-literally, but "her only scripture" line edges toward direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (cloud geometries as notation) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation peaks at "restless euphony—agitated peace," consistent under stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (bronze ripples spawning circles) propels texturally; minor paraphrase loops on "fractal" in mid-beats dull propulsion slightly (-0.4), but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal music vs. storm in floating orchard feels inevitable; risk-taking in sonic-world logic heightens stakes without gimmick, transforming prophecy trope organically.</comment>
