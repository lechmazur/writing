<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in father's unfinished scroll and grandmother's thorn, compelling micro-choices like enduring cold and precise strokes. Interiority embodied in "hands, stained with ink and memory" and heart syncing with drips shows contradiction between treason and forgiveness. Final unlinking earns change with felt historical weight; minor epiphanic label in "forging was itself a form of forgiveness" slips but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (aurora, drips, twilight) builds to CR closure in unlinking seal and empire's wane, reweighting tyranny with conceptual cost legible in "disc began to spin, unlinking its power." Orientation anchored early in sanctuary. Single scene coherent, no shards; cost felt in "calibrated treason settle into place."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: aurora's glow reveals hidden ink, stalactites' drip syncs heart and time, cold stone constrains endurance. Recurring pearl twilight and marble constrain choice (altar aperture) and charge final image of "slipped into the dawn." POV bias filters through forger's ink-stained precision; no white-room, evolves with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlink tyrant's seal to forgive unfinished) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via scroll-forging to altar mechanism under lens. Agency in thorn insertion forces trade-off, narrowing to precise blow; cost visible in "weight of history pressing" and empire's crumble. One tightening sufficient; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forgiveness-through-treason emerges organically from thorn-quill acts and hidden script, reweighted in final "unfinished was at last forgiven" image without moralizing. Subtext in aurora-shimmer parallels internal shift; complexity in treason as "small forgiveness" lingers plausibly. Protagonist arc ties to thematic question via scroll completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: ink-rose diction, rhythmic drip echoes. Lyrical compression taught early via motifs sustains texture under resolve; no head-hopping or elision withholding. Prose modulates serenity to deepening violet shadows, heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm purposeful with motif recurrence (drips, twilight) avoiding loops via pattern payoff at closure; sentence variety propels via varied openings. Minor paraphrase in repeated "forgive unfinished" across paragraphs (−0.4), but density high, no filter stacks or muddled metaphors. Read-aloud ear strong in "ink began to shimmer."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thorn as quill-key for aurora-ink treason transforms forgery trope organically. Risk in lyric repetition heightens stakes without gimmick; non-obvious moral calculus (treason=forgiveness) inevitable in hindsight via altar reveal.</comment>
