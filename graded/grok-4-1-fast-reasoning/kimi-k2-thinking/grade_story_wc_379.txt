<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to prove listening heals roots consistently in her curator trait and intensifies via developer flags, compelling higher-stakes dawn gatherings. Interiority concrete through locket warming in palm during stories. Minor flaw: idealized without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but final display choice earned. Secondary characters like Samir and Elena apply targeted pressure without clutter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds: locket note → mailbox → stories → key → address → reveal → opening with legible linkages narrowing options. Closure as Decisive Change via key turn yielding letters, felt cost in intruding bulldozers met by community response. Orientation anchored early in thrift shop/courtyard. Single tightening at key discovery suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid courtyard at dawn (apricot/rose adobe, jasmine vines) selectively filters via Mira's priorities, constraining key search (north-side white blooms). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under investigation urgency. Mailbox as recurring micro-setting charges final opening image. Spatial choreography coherent across gatherings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve courtyard/prove listening via stories) signaled early by flags, tightens accumulatively through tale density to key reveal narrowing developer threat. Agency in persistent dawn listening forecloses passive acceptance with cost (emotional risk in Elena's tears). One decisive deepening at letters' exposure charges closure under Causal lens. Moral calculus in community voice vs. intrusion viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening heals emerges organically from story threads to letters' gratitude, resonant via final display reweighting prior developer intrusion without moral state. Subtext in pauses/catches during tales; ambiguity in sealed mystery lingers then crystallizes. Protagonist arc inextricable as curation deepens to story-saving. Non-literal closure answers via polished mailbox pointing to Mira.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (reading histories in objects); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating hushed intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Samir's whisper, Elena's tears), goal-driven advancing plot. No head-hopping; free indirect clean. Minor register elevation in metaphors consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6<comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "sandstorm calm" reprise x2) and synonym loops ("dawn" density) dull peak reveals slightly (−0.4). High density integrates setting/action. Clean mechanics; no major artifacts touch closure. Sentence variety supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator unlocks community via locket/mailbox stories against development, transforming preservation trope through listening method. Risk in accumulative tales over confrontation pays off at letters' reveal. Particulars (oilcloth key, white jasmine) memorable. Bold tone modulation heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
