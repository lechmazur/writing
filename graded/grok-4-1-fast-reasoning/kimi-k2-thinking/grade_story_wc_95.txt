<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mechanical arm integrates well via precise parries, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; motivation feels declared via repetition rather than embodied struggle, diluting the final thrust's earnability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding needle card/sundial coordinates -> duel preparation -> victory; on-page DC closure via courteous thrust with duel cost legible, though grove coordinates unresolved creates minor causal ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial and needle card as micro-settings constrain decoding choice and charge duel path; glass atrium's echoes and fractured sunlight purposefully mirror chaos, with brook anchoring orientation early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duel as intellectual dance) tightens via sundial glance enabling fluid strikes; agency in parry-riposte narrows options, but opponent pressure lacks deepening complication before stumble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of questions-to-destinations emerges via decoding-duel arc, resonant in final brook reflection; repetition like "turning questions into destinations" borders thematic echo, reducing subtlety at close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward patterns/codes; rhythmic prose ("whirred as he raised his foil") modulates elegantly under duel stress, no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("hidden overture," "turning questions") borders paraphrase loop but serves accumulative texture; vivid rhythm in duel clashes ("each clash of steel sent echoes"), minor overwriting in atrium descriptions dulls peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher-duelist with puzzle props (needle card/sundial) transforms fencing trope via coded overture; risk in poetic dignity amid chaos heightens stakes organically.</comment>
