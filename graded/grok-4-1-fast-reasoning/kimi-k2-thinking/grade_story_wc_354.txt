<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via thumb-dent sensation and pulse-breathing correlation; final release earned by debt-rooted contradiction between protection and freedom, with embodied cost in erased footprints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of pulses/memories builds to CR closure in stone release and departure; cost legible in "footprints already erased by shifting fields" reconfiguring covenant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nexus lodestone gravel and pulses constrain translation attempt and charge final stone-click image; sensory selection (humming, vertigo) mirrors internal stakes without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode debt before phase) signaled early and tightens via deepening correlations narrowing to renunciation; agency in release forecloses presence with felt absence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice reversal emerges organically via silence-as-lesson motif shifting from betrayal to "dangerous freedom"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (magnetic flutters as knight paths) with rhythmic chess diction; no elision or head-hopping, voice modulates meditative intensity cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but metaphor density in reflective beats ("ghost gambits," "magnetic twilight") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess covenant with magnetic silence-translation transforms tropes; risk in lyric absence-image heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
