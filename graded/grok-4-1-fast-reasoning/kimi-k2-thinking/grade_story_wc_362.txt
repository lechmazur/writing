<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between data-driven proof and porous communion act in scene, earning the closure transformation; "letting the car's tragedy rewrite her own neural pathways" embodies the felt cost of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from prism discovery to frost words; Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly with cost in "She no longer needed to prove... needed only to find the language," reweighting her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost constrain choices (angling prism to window) and charge final image ("arbor seemed somehow less solid"); selective sensory details like "humming... in her teeth" filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to prove emotional absorption tightens texturally via deepening resonance spikes and frost shapes/words, forcing endurance with cost; minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak before "neural pathways" payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truthful lies emerges organically from prism refraction and frost message "She was already gone before the impact," offering resonant non-literal answer in final realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (scientific-mystic lens on "electromagnetic resonance"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in "shifted hush" without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative pattern (frost as "lace that mapped grief"); no loops or artifacts dull closure image of mist withdrawing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic empiricism transforms ghost-car trope into textural proof; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via irreplaceable prism-frost mechanics.</comment>
