<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in duty-to-urgency shift, with concrete micro-choices like button cataloging revealing values. Interiority particular via wind-whispered name and embodied breath amid ticking. Minor slip: transformation to "something more urgent" summarized rather than dramatized in a pivotal micro-beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to prophecy reveal as Conceptual Repricing; before/after legible in shift from sealed prisons to open hands. Final button placement tightens meaningfully. Cost undeniable in "lay down their glass prisons," reconfiguring time's rule-set on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (petrified sap glowing, buttons' thread-hole wear) filter through POV urgency. Warehouse constrains navigation ("narrow aisles") and charges final image ("permanent resonance within the amber walls"). No generic placeholders; micro-setting of jar/vault guides discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble for possibility) signaled early, deepens texturally via decades' catalog to final button under Accum lens. Agency in placement forecloses archival isolation with ticking-time cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges organically from scattering fragments to communal resonance, avoiding statements. Prophecy question offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting possession premise. Final image ("voice to sing through the stone") lingers with ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing buttons by "valley origin, age of thread-holes"). Poetic rhythm modulates intensity, prose texture character-specific (time as resin/sand). No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each tick a reminder that time itself was running out"); rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language consistent/patterned (sand/resin/insects) without muddle in climax. Minor repetition of "buttons" purposeful for taxonomy build, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons-as-syllables and prophecy-in-jar transforms time-tending trope organically. Ingenuity peaks in taxonomy ("by the pitch they'd revealed"), inevitable at final assembly. Bold poetic risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
