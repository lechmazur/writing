<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to grasp "the shape of home" intensifies credibly through embodied hesitation ("feather trembling") before the decisive press, earning her talent awakening. Contradictory impulses shine in weighing wounds against belonging. Minor slip: archetypal seer traits lean toward poetic labels over raw contradiction in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering aisles to alcove revelation, culminating in CR closure where shelves align spelling home, with cost in shattered "delicate balance of substituted nights." One tightening via glyph-tracing pulse suffices. Orientation anchored early in bookstore maze; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves and shifting corridors constrain search, charging final exhale/alignment image. Sensory weave (dust taste, wet ink, echoing thunder) filters through Mira's bias, evolving with pulse ripple. Micro-setting like basalt pedestal guides pivotal feather-trace choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher stone for home's shape) signaled early, tightens texturally via "hidden thunder" warning into agency-driven press on final glyph, foreclosing balance with eruption cost. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens, reweighting fear into heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of home as woven connections emerges implicitly via stone's unlock and shelf realignment, offering non-literal CR answer in dawn peak etching new shape. Returning thunder motif shifts from warning to "heartbeat" without moralizing. Resonance recharges particulars organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature (cracked mirror eyes spilling "silvery memory that burned"), modulating rhythm with intensity at glyph-trace. Stable close-third POV; purposeful mythic compression legible under textural lens, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but peak activation beat overwrites slightly with stacked figures ("shiver ran... glow... illuminating... poured... unlocking"), docking minor clarity. Motif repetition (thunder) pattern-taught, not looped. No scaffolds; ear-test rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: feather-texture method on shifting glyphs transforms seer-quest trope into pattern-home revelation, risking mythic lyricism that heightens closure charge. Inevitable hindsight via mountain-as-map premise; no derivative echoes.</comment>
