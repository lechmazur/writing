<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via peripheral focus trait enabling discoveries, with motivation intensifying from repair to redesign overload; earned change in choosing release over harvest shown in quartz lens installation. Minor abstraction in emotions lacks embodied contradiction during peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern observations build to conceptual repricing closure: new mechanism's click releases echoes with conceptual cost of redefining harvest (hoard vs. share). Orientation anchored immediately in cavern and broken timer; one tightening via overload insight suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's veins and curved surfaces constrain choices via reflection angles, charging final image of angled light and smiling reflection; sensory details (vibrations, condensation) selective and POV-biased toward acoustic patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore Echo Chamber) tightens accumulatively through overload deepening, narrowing to release redesign with agency in lens grinding; cost legible in shattered gears' failure persisting as shared echoes rather than fixed harvest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder stored via architectural release emerges organically from echo patterns and redesign, resonant in final cavern song reweighting hoarding premise without statement; invites ambiguity in wounded season's meaningful scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of oblique patterns and reflective diction modulating to quiet poise at close; rhythmic control heightens discovery beats without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm varying sentence lengths; minor paraphrase loop in "reflection angles at different times" repetition slightly dulls mid-beat propulsion but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh chronomantic premise transforms locksmith craft into temporal architecture, with peripheral trait enabling non-obvious release solution; risk in redesign inevitability heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
