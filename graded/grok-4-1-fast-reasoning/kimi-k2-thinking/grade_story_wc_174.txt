<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through reversed tales compelling audience realizations; interiority concrete in obsession with erasures. Earned change as he tests stick's power successfully with felt cost in stripped certainties. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses in pivotal performance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prep to reversals to hush. Orientation anchored early in dome entry. Closure as CR in "truth enters atmosphere and burns away your certainties," with undeniable conceptual cost reweighting narratives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "cracked parabolic ceiling" concentrate quiet, mirroring internal states and charging final hush. Setting as laboratory constrains show and guides epiphanies. Recurrent dish recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical subversion signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening reversals narrowing moral certainty. Agency in puppetry forces audience trade-offs with legible cost in realizations. Trucker's exit crystallizes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stories as erasures emerges organically from reversals, resonant in "every story is a series of erasures." Final image offers non-literal answer reweighting choices without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "traced phantom serifs," rhythmic control modulates to hush. Prose texture distinct and biased to calligraphic subversion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts. Figuratives purposeful in shadows/reversals without muddle in peak epiphanies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reversed puppetry in radar dome transforms storytelling tropes; risk of nonlinear tales heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via stick's ancestral whispers to final serif.</comment>
