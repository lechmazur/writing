<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in mismatched heart/actions propel micro-choices like paddling past poles; earned alignment crystallizes at compass spin pointing to cemetery, foreclosing regret-clutching with felt relief-sob cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via fog-deepened memory density and pole-pattern cadence tightening to RR closure; cost legible in compass abandonment on barnacled rock as Elias walks inland.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog and utility poles constrain navigation choices while charging final star-alignment image; sensory selectivity (salt spray, humming transformer) mirrors internal fog without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (alignment amid regrets) signaled early tightens accumulatively through fog-rehearsal deepening knowledge of sister's forgiveness; agency in drift/paddle forecloses resistance with legible emotional cost at cannery arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Navigation-as-forgiveness theme emerges organically from poles recast as sister's "stars that lost ambition"; ending reconfigures premise via compass-tide release without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward melancholic lyricism (e.g., "merrily melancholic heart finally beating in time"); rhythmic modulation heightens fog-pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful pole motif propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on regrets/poles dull mid-beat slightly, but closure image clean and varied rhythm supports read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms mundane poles into forgiveness monuments via sister's quip; risk-taking lyric accumulative heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
