<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Malach's rationally rebellious nature drives concrete micro-choices like filing notches amid patrol footsteps, embodying internal conflict between evidence and Council's narrative; embodied calm ("didn't flinch") reveals hierarchy of values with execution risk as cost. Minor telling of "philosophers' duty" slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sedimentary evidence density builds to patrol interruption, delivering Charged Poise closure: cog hidden in niche ("sediment would seal it for centuries"), reconfiguring truth's endurance with conceptual cost of silenced voices legible in final slip away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sewer micro-setting constrains via brick niche for hiding cog, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (dripping water, brick dust, lantern light) filters through Malach's stratigraphic gaze, evolving with patrol splash to mirror internal abrasion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode method vs. obedience) signaled early tightens accumulatively as patrol nears, forcing faster filing that forecloses martyrdom narrative with felt execution risk; agency in "defiant geometry" yields endurance cost without full reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of method over mythology emerges organically from stratigraphic maps and cog-filing, resonant in CR final image ("cog would tell its own story, layer by logical layer") reweighting narratives without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (stratigraphic precision, e.g., "tooth angles like a ship's navigator") modulates rhythm under stress; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, patrol's "Stop" contrasting Malach's flat retort.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and rhythmic acceleration in filing beat; minor paraphrase loops in rebellion phrasing ("rationally rebellious," repeated echoes) dull one mid-section without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stratigraphic truth-encoding in cog transforms post-plague trope, with risk-taking in quiet CR closure heightening stakes via abrasive endurance over confrontation.</comment>
