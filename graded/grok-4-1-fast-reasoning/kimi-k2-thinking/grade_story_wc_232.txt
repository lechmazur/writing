<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion culminate in earned closure choice, with contradictory impulses (solitude vs. adventure) shown through visions of refused life. "Empirically intuitive" trait roots pattern-seeing without labels. Minor reflection on Clara anchors present but slightly dilutes peak pressure before cavern.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip's glimmer → ants → cavern → doorway DC with cost in chip sinking and life visions. Orientation anchors early (shop, creek, midsummer). Closure reconfigures options legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (petrichor, nectar drips, bioluminescent fungi) constrains choices via rising creek and fissure squeeze, charging final pool image. POV-filtered details (ant trails mirroring matrix) evolve causally. No white-room; micro-setting (chip, bluff) guides action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise via door) tightens causally through creek escalation, forcing step-through agency with foreclosed solitude cost. Visions crystallize trade-off at climax. One decisive narrowing suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decisions as lived proof emerges organically from ant-map, visions, and step; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in "lived all at once." No platitudes; irony in self-voice earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (pattern-seeking in ink/ants); rhythmic modulation builds to terse closure. No head-hopping; diction fits intuitive loner without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel through cavern bloom; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "cathedral of bioluminescent fungi" fits lyric tone without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ants as living map, matrix Q-chip, decision-doorway transforms treasure trope into empirical faith. Risky cavern payoff inevitable from setup; no templates.</comment>
