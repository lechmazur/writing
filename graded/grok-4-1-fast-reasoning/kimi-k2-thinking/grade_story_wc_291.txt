<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between methodical armor and emerging warmth, earned in "lancing the wound of her own apathy, letting it bleed onto canvas"; change compels desperate painting with visible cost to prior detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via detail density building to CR closure—"Her blindness had always been a subtraction; now it became an addition"—with cost legible in reweighted sight; ribbon-to-arrest tightening narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry's fissures and mist constrain evidence find and witness pressure, charging final image where "the furrowed hush had lifted... matching the rhythm of the earth"; selective sensory filter reflects POV geometries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathy awakening) tightens via ribbon-sparked desperation under Accumulative lens, forcing trade-off in hollow-to-alive portrait; cost unmistakable in "cold arithmetic... give way to warmth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unseen-made-visible emerges organically from unifying process, resonant CR in "a different kind of sight" reweighting opposites without moralizing; final quarry return answers via charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("geometries of grief, ratios of loss") biases details character-specifically; rhythmic modulation heightens shift without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in painting beat ("needle, piercing... lanced") borders overwrites without muddling closure; no loops, clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's portraits solving via blindness-transformed sight offers fresh synthesis, transforming cold-case trope through grounded method; risk in lyrical structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
