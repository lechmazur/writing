<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to restore sacred practices intensifies compellingly to the singing choice, rooted in tinkerer traits shifting from gadgets to song. Interiority concrete but lacks deep contradictory impulses in pivotal vine-touch moment. Earned endurance shown in weeks of prior effort paying off with vine's twitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hush to song-woven stories, culminating in Charged Poise RR as vine revives with felt cost of forgotten tradition's near-loss. Orientation anchored early in arbor at dawn. Single scene with one tightening suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor at dawn vividly selective (rustling leaves, cool bark, dew), constraining Elara's palm-to-bark song and charging final dawn-kissed sprout image. Sensory hierarchy reflects tinkerer's priorities (copper scent integrates). No white-room; evolves causally with vine's blush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vine revival for rite) signaled early, tightens via tendril's twitch to full sprout under Accumulative lens, narrowing failure option with agency in song. Cost legible in "quiet flame" effort and foreclosed forgotten harvest. Coherent pressure to communal celebration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory's restoration emerges organically from song-threads and vine's spin, resonant non-literal answer in final arbor's "quiet magic" reweighting tradition's fragility. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in communal promise. Particulars like music box seed closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (mist-soft voice, golden threads), rhythmic control heightens hush-to-exhale cadence. No head-hopping; diction modulates dawn hush to moonlit feast without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short hush beats to rising melody), high density in arbor actions, but minor paraphrase loops in "golden stories" and "gathering hush" repetitions dull peak vine revival slightly. No major artifacts touching closure; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer using song over gears transforms folklore trope, with vine's coil as organic turn from withered to luminous. Risky lyric poise heightens restoration stakes; no template echoes.</comment>
