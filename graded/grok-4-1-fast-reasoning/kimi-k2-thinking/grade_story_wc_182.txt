<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's resourcefulness drives key choices like filling diary gaps into a key and proposing the pact, earning her shift from mapper to renegotiator with embodied caution in descent. Contradictory impulses show in firm stance against glowing warden despite shiver. Minor slip in stock "color returned to cheeks" dilutes embodiment at rescue climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gaps accumulate into cipher, pact key, descent harmonies guiding to CR closure at library entry where reading silence reweights knowledge premise with pact's felt exchange cost. Orientation anchored early in bookstore arrival. Pivotal renegotiation moment cleanly causal under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic glass ceiling and unread books constrain discovery choice, charging final image; perfume of herbs mirrors rescue stakes tactilely. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's linguistic lens filters stone hums as symphony. Mountain guardian pressures pact without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue via gaps to library) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at warden pact where agency in new agreement forecloses direct access option with diary exchange cost. Escalation coheres to Charged Poise at volume's lesson. Minor abstract stakes in legend dilute peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gaps as knowledge bridges emerges organically via diary omissions turning to key, culminating in non-literal CR where library line teaches silence-listening, reweighting symphony motif without moral. Counter-reading in warden's heavy silence adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in linguistic metaphors like "mute chords"; voice rhythm modulates to swell at library. Traveler's brief explanation natural/subtextual. Minor convergence in poetic diction across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but "unheard symphony" motif loops 7+ times create patterned artifact bordering redundancy, dulling climax propulsion; minor synonym churn in "silent/mute/unheard." Rhythm varies read-aloud effectively otherwise. Over figurative density in descent without pause touches warden beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic gaps as physical key transforms bookstore trope into symphony labyrinth; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable at CR library where unlearned lessons reconfigure knowledge organically.</comment>
