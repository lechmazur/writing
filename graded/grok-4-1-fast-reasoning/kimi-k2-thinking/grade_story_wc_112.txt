<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Obliging nature earns access via shuttle fix, rooting motivation in traits; mechanically warm hands embody conviction without labels; realization feels earned through patient micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to nexus bloom and CR closure (secret held amid dismissal); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in fragile truth and data rejection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frosted copper valves and crystalline wings constrain choices (seals, power divert); POV filters mechanic priorities; final nexus image charged by recurring frost/twilight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) tightens via lever pull and surge, forcing response to Chen; agency in diversion forecloses linear illusion with conceptual cost in fragile realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sideways time emerges from particulars (wings brushing moments, timelines as frost); final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via nexus fade and held secret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (patterns algorithms miss) consistent; psychic distance modulates to quiet intensity; Chen's comm natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense metaphors (violet flower of spacetime) cohere without muddle; rhythm varies with scene breath; minor density in opening descriptions purposeful for accumulative buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sideways time via magnetic dreams transforms sci-fi trope organically; risk in poetic physics pays off in CR; fresh synthesis of mechanic intuition and leviathan scale.</comment>
