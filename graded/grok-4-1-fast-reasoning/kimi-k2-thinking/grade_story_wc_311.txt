<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reaper's contradictory duty (naming others' fears) versus personal ache culminates in mirror realization, embodied in unbeating heart that "still remembered how to ache," earning closure choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via cylinder plays and crystallizations to CR closure: void-mirror reweights sacrifice premise, with cost legible in "infinite and immediate" distance reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusk light constrains crystallizations ("angled the sextant until a prism split the beam"), evolving to "sharp silver of stars" charging final separation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (naming fears) deepens accumulatively from others' crystals to own mirror, protagonist agency in angling light forces confrontation with undeniable personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirror in atlas void resonates as non-literal answer to naming's limits ("see how small it becomes when it has a name?"), recharging prior crystals without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light refracting grief) holds stable single POV, rhythmic modulation intensifies to charged poise at mirror without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful crystal motif, but figurative layering ("patterns of broken gold," gem fears) slightly thickens peak naming beats without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper naming fears via occult observatory optics transforms grief tropes, with mirror-void turn inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
