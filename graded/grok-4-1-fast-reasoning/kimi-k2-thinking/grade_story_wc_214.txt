<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sola's arc from armored loneliness to embracing vulnerability is earned through concrete micro-choices like chanting to stars and placing the glass, with embodied emotion in her swelling heart. Internal conflict shows via softening against prior armor. Minor deduction for occasional diagnostic phrasing like "vulnerability became her strength" that borders on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from glass discovery to moss garden and legend; closure as Conceptual Repricing of "overlooked era" as cocoon lands on-page with felt cost in Sola's vow to tend. Orientation anchored early in station and role. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station's rusted gears, fractured windows, and cooling metal constrain Sola's sweeping and star-tracing, charging final image of glass in window casting glow. Sensory details (whispering uniform, luminous mist) selective via her priorities. Micro-setting via glass evolves causally with moss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of questioning void tightens texturally via glass-enabled empathy and garden growth, narrowing to Charged Poise in meteor shower whisper; agency in preservation forecloses armored isolation with heart-cost. One deepening suffices; cost legible in "shared moment of fragility."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from glass mist to moss testament, with final sanctuary image resonating non-literally. Direct line "vulnerability is not weakness, but the very force..." echoes thesis, docking for mild moralizing in visitors' scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with cosmic perceptual signature (stars exhaling, metal sighing); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to pulsing vitality. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm suits lyric mode, no loops despite "hush/stillness" pattern (taught/payoff). Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but coheres without muddle at closure garden image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor tending cosmic stillness transforms trope of isolation into primal garden legend; glass-stardust mechanics feel inevitable. Risky lyric hush risks stasis but heightens vulnerability stakes organically.</comment>
