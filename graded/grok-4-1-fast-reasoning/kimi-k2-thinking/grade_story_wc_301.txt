<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in "every sound felt like a needle, every shadow a ghost," rooting motivation in off-meds vulnerability and guilt; earns endurance via methodical counting of cracks. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies like "truth was not a fixed point but a current" edges below elite without deeper flaw-cost tie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation at ivy-overgrown station; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final image of walking away with river-truth realization, cost felt in "weight lift... river washing her clean." Single scene adheres to defaults, no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy, graffiti, and accordion constrain choices (traces letters, handles bellows) and charge closure via recurring green whispers mirroring forgiveness; sensory hierarchy reflects off-meds urgency narrowing to tactility. Recurrent station elements evolve tactilely without static repetition, elevating to very strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant self-forgiveness stake signaled early tightens texturally via memory surge forcing breath-count micro-choices, narrowing to Charged Poise endurance; cost legible in forced breathing amid screams recall. Lacks deeper agency-driven reversal, keeping below 8.0 despite coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of flowing forgiveness emerges organically via river/ivy/accordion images shifting at end without moralizing; resonant CR reweights past-stain premise. Graffiti line "'Forgive the past, flow forward'" borders thematic echo (−0.5), diluting subtlety in pivotal bathroom moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in heightened off-meds senses ("rust" in throat); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture purposefully. Minor register elevation in reflections like "daringly methodical" feels unearned for raw voice but doesn't leak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "raw solace," "weight lift," and accordion echoes dull density across reflections; template cadence in "felt a [noun]" runs (crack in armor, flicker of solace, piece of weight) obscure propulsion in memory beat (−1.2). Figurative muddle like pulsing map heartbeats strains without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of off-meds river chronicler seeking forgiveness in ivy-choked station transforms redemption trope via patched accordion's silent song reprise. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
