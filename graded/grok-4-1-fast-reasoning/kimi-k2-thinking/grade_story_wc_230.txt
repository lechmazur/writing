<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between rational precision and curse's raw honesty, embodied in "each sentence a splinter" and final balanced use; micro-choices like burying then uncovering earn change with cost to hiding instinct. Minor therapy-speak ("cultivate psychological safety") diagnostic without full embodiment slightly dulls peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of orchard images and eye whispers builds to CR closure in studying cracked eye as "map of cracks... mending," reweighting curse-as-tool with trust's fragile cost legible in final weave of ropes and sap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard and storms constrain choices (bury in cliff hollow, anchor with ropes) and charge final ripening fruit scent of healing; sensory hierarchy (mud incisions, thrashing branches echoing turmoil) mirrors POV's scientific bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety vs. truth tightens accumulatively when uncovering eye forces honesty that peels "armor of fear," narrowing to controlled binding; cost felt in "balance raw force of truth against delicate fabric of trust."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of managed truth as healing emerges organically from eye's reveal to villagers sparking shared pains; final image reconfigures premise without moral, lingering in "fractured grace" ambiguity of survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific metaphors ("measured incision," "weigh risks") modulates rhythm under stress; stable first-person POV with purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; minor figurative density ("splinter... wound") in early beats purposeful for lyric mode but risks slight overwrites without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-curse relic in post-virus orchard world feels inevitable, transformed via forager's rational arc; risk-taking in accumulative poise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
