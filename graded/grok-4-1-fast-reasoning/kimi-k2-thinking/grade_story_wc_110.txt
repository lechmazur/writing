<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to thaw mistrust drives pivotal choices like using the lens and confronting the manager, rooted in her registrar diligence. Interiority feels embodied in "heart beat in the resonant hush" but lapses into diagnostic epiphanies like "quiet freedom" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final placement of evidence earns her change but lacks deeper flaws complicating the path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lens pickup therefore doodle reveal therefore lobby projection therefore office confrontation. Orientation anchored early in forecourt post-concert. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with stagehand's confession and "tears mixing with the rain," legible cost in thawed team weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-slicked crystal forecourt vividly sensory, whispering motif recurs to mirror internal hush and charge final prism image. Setting guides choices: forecourt lens find to lobby projection. POV-filtered details like crystal "whispers" constrain reflective stance without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering theft tightens causally via doodle map to projection reveal, narrowing options to confrontation. Agency in slipping to lobby forecloses silence path. Cost legible in manager's softening and stagehand tears, charging team release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing emerges via lens/ticket particulars, but final lines moralize overtly ("transparency is the key to freeing oneself from doubt"), replacing image resonance. Subtext in ambiguously clear doodles lingers ambiguously without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush/crystal fixation; voice modulates poetically under resolve. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-pursuing in manager's nod/thanks. Repetitive phrasing risks uniformity but reads voice-motivated for hush motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence in repeated "resonant hush" (6+ instances, including closure) and "thaw" variants dull propulsion, obscuring final image. Synonym churn in trust/light/prism descriptors across ending paragraphs. Figurative density overwrites peak beats without payoff, failing zero-loop test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens etching revealing ticket doodles transforms mystery trope into registrar-specific ingenuity, fresh synthesis. Crystal hush forecourt adds memorable angle on transparency. Risky poetic repetition heightens tone without gimmick.</comment>
