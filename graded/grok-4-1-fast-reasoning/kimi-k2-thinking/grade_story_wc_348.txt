<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Polymer-grief linkage roots motivation consistently; weakness in told epiphanies without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in foam insight beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with foam-to-polymer density tightening to RR closure; chrysalis release and lab hum land reconfiguration cost legibly on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>River foam recurs as object constraining insight choice and charging polymer final image under POV's symphonic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant atonement stake signaled early, deepened by foam tracing that forecloses constricted grief with unwinding cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symphonic-polymer perceptual signature distinct and stable; minor diction elevation in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Braid/weave" motif loops (5+ instances) create synonym churn dulling propulsion; dual "pieces fall into place" paraphrases redundancy in insight beat; figurative overload pervades without sparse contrast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Foam-polymer-symphony synthesis transforms grief trope into fresh, grounded insight.</comment>
