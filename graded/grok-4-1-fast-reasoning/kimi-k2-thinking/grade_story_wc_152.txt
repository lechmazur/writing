<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied pauses and breath catching at the revealed message, driving micro-choices like folding the tapestry; motivation to listen and act feels earned through consistent traits without epiphanies; minor summary of backstory fits BRR but lacks deeper contradiction in peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from stitching rhythms to message reveal; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "stepped into the corridor... eternal candle lighting her path," reconfiguring options with legible cost of narrowing possibilities and time running out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt walls absorbing light and eternal candle constrain perception and choices, charging final image as beacon; autumn leaves and flame provide selective sensory vividness mirroring internal states; micro-setting anchors tactile navigation without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering conspiracy tightens accumulatively through flame signals and message emergence, forcing decision to act; one deepening reversal at "hidden message emerged" narrows trust options with felt isolation cost; agency in leaving forecloses passive stitching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges organically from stitching and silence, resonating in final promise "I will not let your stories fade" that reweights resistance without moralizing; ambiguity in trust lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias to flickers and silences; rhythmic modulation builds intensity without head-hopping; diction purposeful and biased to cosmic whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motif repetition of "silence" (7+ times) and "echo/ed/whisper" creates taught pattern but paraphrase loops dull propulsion in mid-stitching beats; dense metaphors persist into reveal without payoff, causing minor overwrite; rhythm varies read-aloud with strong opening anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy map via flame-synced threads transforms tropes; fresh "adjacent possibilities" threading and foolish-wise disguise feel inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
