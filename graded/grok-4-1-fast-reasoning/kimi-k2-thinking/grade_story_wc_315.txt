<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Concrete buckle handling and muscle memory evoke embodied resolve under burden, but repetitive "watcher's burden" invocations feel label-like, muting contradictory impulses; no simultaneous internal conflict in revision beat lowers from higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with reflective density tightening to revision override; vibration confirms DC/RR closure with felt enduring cost in "burden lift slightly, though never fully vanish"; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor sway and vine data streams constrain edge-standing revision choice; recurring buckle and starlit arbor charge final image, filtering through POV vigilance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tether integrity/trust) signaled early, accumulatively deepens via radio cue to buckle-secured override narrowing failure; visible cost in fluctuating tension and persistent burden coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from arbor hum-heartbeat sync and buckle testament, reweighting premise in final "timeless reminder of the watcher's burden" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking bias and rhythmic modulation; capped by Q7 debt, but purposeful poetic compression suits accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("watcher's burden," "soundless echo," "preserve trust under pressure") recur across reflections, dulling propulsion and touching closure image; template cadence in repetitive stems creates artifact drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating arbor and pattern-seeking guardian synthesize fresh sci-fi vigilance frame; buckle's relic evolution transforms hesitation trope organically into charged poise.</comment>
