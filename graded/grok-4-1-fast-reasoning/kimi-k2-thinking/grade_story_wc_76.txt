<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in inventive traits drives choices, with "neatly inventive mind saw the hidden pattern" aligning actions to reversal; embodied "bleak exhilaration" particularizes emotion. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak disassembly beats, leaning competent without struggle complicating closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore: yoyo mapping therefore timed spin at tide turn yields DC closure as stone cracks and light flares. Orientation anchors lighthouse/island/who immediately; cost legible in "hunger stone would eventually hunger again," shaping charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "barnacled stone" and "pulsed like a rotten heart" filters through inventive POV, constraining climax via brass plate alignment. Tide and lantern room evolve causally, charging final beam image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reverse curse signaled early, tightens causally at tide exhale when stone weakest, forcing spin agency with temporary fix cost foreclosing permanent path. Escalation driven by her micro-choices narrowing to yoyo reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of defying fate emerges organically via yoyo reversal and light reclaiming reef, with final "heart ticking in reverse" reweighting premise non-literally. Minor slip in "time would never again be a prison" edges toward echo but ties to clock motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in gear/surgeon imagery; rhythmic prose modulates to high-pitched hum at climax. Keeper's minimal speech distinct via "kelp-beard trembling"; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but "slow exhale of low tide" loops 6+ times create patterned artifact dulling propulsion; minor metaphor mix in "grey finger" to "rotten heart" without coherence loss. Closure image clear despite end paraphrase redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo puzzle reversing lighthouse curse via clock maker transforms tropes organically; risk in counter-clockwise motif heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at spin payoff.</comment>
