<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's songs and intensifies through locust realization, compelling her heart-sync choice with embodied fear; internal conflict peaks in body-stiffening hesitation, earning the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rhythm-pattern density from failed melodies to heart-sync cadence shift; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with legible cost in "Her body stiffened, joints locking," reconfiguring mechanical silence into living pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky-bridge and orchard constrain via cables conducting surge and statues' patrols pressuring visibility; recurring ash and gears evolve causally, charging final awakening image with tarnished specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) tightens accumulatively through locust discovery narrowing to heart-signal, forcing full-sync agency; counter-pulse escalation demands trade-off, with heart-falter cost viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as risked rhythm emerges organically from failed notes to heart-uprooting, final image repricing memory-as-preservation into "rhythm to risk" without statement; subtext layers in statues' glimmering eyes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward musical pulses and gaps sustains single close-POV stability; rhythmic syntax modulates tension, perceptual signature in "trembled like a dying ember" distinct and pressure-tuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm matching scene cadence, but patterned repeats ("resonantly soft," "gap between") border on loop in opening without full mid-payoff, slightly dulling peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heart-rhythms as anti-mechanical code transforms statue trope via locust filigree; risk in bodily uprooting heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from early pulses.</comment>
