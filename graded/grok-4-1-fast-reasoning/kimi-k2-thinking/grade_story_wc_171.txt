<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation for redemption via ritual is clear and rooted in past failure, compelling the central invitation to touch the clipboard; however, interiority relies on abstract labels like "weight of redemption" rather than embodied contradiction during the signing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of ritual images to Charged Poise closure in the clipboard's glow and negotiator's realization ("scars would not vanish"), with legible conceptual cost in fragile trust; orientation anchored early, one tightening via general's challenge holds lens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ancient terrace and solstice light constrain ritual choice and charge final image ("last light...kissed its edges"); sensory details filtered through negotiator's gentle cosmic bias mirror internal stakes without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via skepticism challenge to collective hum/glow, forcing shared future trade-off with agency in gentle invitation; cost felt in "willingness of all to share a fragile future."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption as shared trust emerges from ritual particulars and flawed signatures; resonant CR in final horizon image, but direct statements ("price of redemption was...courage to trust") slightly undercut subtext in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with cosmic perceptual signature ("planets traced a slow dance"); rhythmic texture modulates effectively, sparse dialogue purposeful and subtextual in general's challenge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor loops in realization phrasing ("He knew," "he realized," "he understood") near closure and repeated "price of redemption" slightly dull final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diplomat ritual with cosmic alignment transforms peace trope through shared redemption calculus; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens fragile closure without gimmickry.</comment>
