<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liberator's motivation to sow hope is consistent and intensifies through chained endurance, earning the final planting. Interiority shows traits like "patiently, strategic" via actions, but lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices under pressure, like swinging the chain, reveal values effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrow guides keys → vault activates sentry → chain redirection → final press opens hatch, culminating in wall collapse and seed planting as Charged Poise RR with legible cost of persistent chains. Orientation anchored early in carnival center. One tightening via sentry suffices; closure reconfigures chains from bonds to "ladder" on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "stale popcorn and decay" and "cracked linoleum" integrate into action; piano bench constrains puzzle choice. Atmosphere mirrors decay vs. hope, evolving with dust cloud and sunlight. Final dry soil charges image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access seeds) signaled early, escalates causally via sentry under causal lens; agency in impeding with chain forces trade-off. Tightening at "sentry's grip falters" narrows options with physical cost. Visible prices like chain limits alter tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from chained planting in dry soil, reweighting decay with "green rebellion." Final image of seed in parched earth offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like vault seeds charge resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward hope amid ruin; voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating rhythm in stress ("dances around the machine"). No head-hopping; diction fits focalizer. Minor filter excess in observations, but purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/imagery; metaphors like "melodic chime" purposeful around music motif. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., vault reveal), but no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Piano keys as seed vault puzzle transforms carnival decay trope into fresh causal engine for resilience theme. Chained grace vs. sentry yields non-obvious synthesis; risk in poetic machinery heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
