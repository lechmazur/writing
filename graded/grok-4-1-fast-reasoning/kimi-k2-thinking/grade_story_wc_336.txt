<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation singular and intensifies through desperation-fueled creativity, compelling the weaving act; interiority concrete via precise song frequencies and stained hands, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats like the seven-day work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from song-net essences to seed-crack RR (Charged Poise in reversed waterfall and collapsed pruner with sap-cost); orientation anchored early (Vespera on parapet at dawn); one tightening via seven-day escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (waterfall spray as betweenness threads constrains weaving); recurring parapet/orchard charges final image of doorways and sap-stained hands; POV bias in noticing essences like child's laugh reflects priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through essence-capture danger emptying sources; agency in singing/weaving forecloses paths with felt cost (collapse, sap weight); one decisive intensification at seed-crack suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of weaving (not guarding) wonder emerges organically from particulars like captured essences into new tree; final image of doorways and "woven thoughtfully" reconfigures premise without moralizing, lingering via moss secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (essences as violet laugh, amber flight); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to reversed flow under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying lengths build to "color that had no name"); minor "hush" recurrence pattern-taught without loops dulling propulsion; figurative coherence in essences/sap avoids muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruner-weaving realities transforms trope of fading worlds via specific betweenness-water and essence-song; risk in "no pruner had attempted" pays off in doorways/children-seeds closure.</comment>
