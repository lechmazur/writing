<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied shift from jittery grip on pendant to quiet certainty after handing it over, earning change through micro-choices under child's pressure; minor slip in overt epiphany about mentor becoming myth dilutes contradiction slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building resonance to CR closure in mythic fade and enduring echo; on-page cost legible in courier's lost relic reconfigured as shared myth; orientation anchored early on ridgeway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora pulses constrain and mirror pendant's vibration, charging sprout germination and final tree image; selective sensory hierarchy (hum, frost, green flames) reflects courier's resonance bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to coax wonder tightens accumulatively via child's wilted bloom, forcing pendant use and handover that forecloses personal relic with felt loss; agency in kneeling/placing germinates deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resonance germinating wonder/myth emerges organically from pendant-sprout-tree arc, reweighting routine delivery in final mythic endurance without moralizing; resonant CR in silver tree catching aurora.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (vibrations, pulses) modulating rhythm; child's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("silver-leafed tree" twice verbatim, "fade from memory to myth" repeated, "aurora-lit ridgeway" overused) and synonym churn (hum/vibrate/resonate/pulse) dull final third density, obscuring closure propulsion despite vivid images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic myth-making transforms routine delivery trope via sympathetic vibration mechanics; risk in mythic time-fade heightens resonance payoff.</comment>
