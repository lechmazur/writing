<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to certify wonder compels specific micro-choices like tuning bells to aurora shades; synesthetic interiority embodied through "silver thread" and "amber light" visions. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but endurance in ringing under hush pressure earns closure commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as hush density fractures progressively from chisel cue to final golden peal, delivering Charged Poise RR closure when "wonder spilled forth" reconfigures silence with felt release cost in the transformed cavern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices via tuned frequencies and synesthetic matching, charging final image where walls paint with "impossible dreams"; sensory filter reflects Lyra's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unfetter wonder signaled early tightens accumulatively as hush cracks with each bell under aurora pressure, narrowing to final peal that forecloses silence with visible transformation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wonder's essentiality emerges implicitly from hush fracture to breathing silence, with final sculptor reverence reweighting premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity in ongoing ripple invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature biases noticing toward color-sounds consistently; lyrical rhythm modulates from hush tension to release cadence without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax mirroring chime progression, high density integrates sensory advance; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "ribbon freed from a spool" thickens opening without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringing synced to distant chisel transforms silence tropes into fresh conceptual frame; chisel strike as cue risks bold linkage that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
