<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied reactions like "taste of ash on his tongue" and earned flaw confrontation in self-curse revelation; minor slip in repetitive "warlike serenity" lacking deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure with cost in "his own hand had once cast the curse, out of fear"; ritual tightening from circles to seed causal and legible; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vortex "pulling at the hem of his cloak like a greedy hand" constrains planting; ice fractures and lake smoothing charge final image, sensory details purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via failed trick to seed-driven melting, narrowing options with agency; self-revelation cost viscerally felt in "scars that lie beneath."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically through confession reveal reweighting mirrors motif; resonant non-literal close in "truth like a lantern" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias in magical sensing (e.g., "memory clawing"); rhythmic control strong, minor repetition erodes distinction under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive "warlike serenity" (3x) and end whispers/secrets paraphrase loop dull closure image (-0.6); density otherwise high with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of self-curse via devouring vine transforms druid trope; ritual payoff feels inevitable from prior ritual failures.</comment>
