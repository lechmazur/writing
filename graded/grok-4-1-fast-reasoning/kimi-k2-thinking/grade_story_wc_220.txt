<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied sensory perception (nose parsing static into syntax) reveals particular traits under pressure; Wick's shift from salvage to quest earns closure choice with emotional cost in vault realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from cylinder find to vault; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page with legible cost in "distance between them was never in miles but in the silence," reconfiguring prior absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrap mountain and cracked earth constrain journey (water in radiator, scent navigation); waxed leaf as micro-setting charges final image by enabling hatch and warming chest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging silence/distance) signaled early via riddle, tightens accumulatively through journey risks to vault payoff; agency in placing leaf forecloses isolation with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved connection emerges organically from cylinder voices and leaf; final image of curling among messages offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with bloodhound perceptual signature (scents as memory/maps, ears as Braille); rhythmic diction modulates from wild hush to broken silence without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("wind carried a wild hush"); figurative density taught early (grooves hold more than music) pays off without muddle in closure vault scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc bloodhound questing via phonograph voices transforms tropes; vault of deployment messages risks bold emotional payoff that heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
