<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to transmute pain is consistent and shown through rituals, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or flawed blind spots complicating choices; calm trait idealizes without visible tradeoffs in pivotal communal additions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from solitary arcs to communal pilgrimage; Charged Poise closure in final photograph placement reconfigures loss into ongoing grace with felt incorporation cost; orientation anchored early in lavender field ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ruins, lavender, stone altar vividly constrain and mirror archivist's mapping, evolving causally with vines and light to charge final gold-painted image; sensory selectivity (perfume, rust, silver shadows) reflects perceptual calm without generic catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing signaled early via arcs, tightens accumulatively through contributions (widow's photo, child's daisy) narrowing isolation; cost legible in non-erasure but abstract, not viscerally testing agency at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rearranging wounds emerges from photo arcs and vines without statement; final circle completion offers resonant non-literal answer via "hurt becomes beauty," reweighting premise with incorporation cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in poetic topography of memory; child dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythm modulates calmly without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("arcs in black-and-white photographs," "perceptively calm," vines climb) creates paraphrase loops dulling density in mid-section; figurative density overwrought without full pattern payoff, but propulsion holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief cartography via photo arcs in post-industrial lavender transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens remembrance stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
