<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory numbness versus ache for validation drives the sensei's insight into clones' fear; final merger earned by perceiving their "hollow core," with embodied grief as cost in kneeling moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: clones' appearance → history shudders → vivify merges them with cost (grief flood); on-page DC closure as "brain dissolved into luminous motes that swirled into his chest."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating dojo constrains as it "crumbles" and "melts," charging final image where he floats on will; formaldehyde "swirling like liquid time" mirrors void and anchors tactile choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (singular consciousness) tightens via clones' fear when jar lifted, forcing vivify agency; cost legible in "grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges organically via merger, reweighting enlightenment in final tears as "pain that proves we're alive"; resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in "sliced through pretense like a blade through rice paper"; rhythmic modulation peaks in climax light arcs, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors woven into action (e.g., "silver-blue veins"); minor figurative density in clones' argument but purposeful pattern, no loops dulling "jar shattered" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death, clones, and emotional brain jar transforms martial tropes; risk in philosophical paradox heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
