<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sentimentalism embodied in upward tears and color-weeping drives consistent motivation to share light sans fire, with internal conflict peaking in gear-touch realization of inherited fear. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. extinction dread) act in sonar shift to lullaby. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "light was not flame but information" feels slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pollen touch to gear activation to petal-encoding, culminating in CR where infinity reprices as repeating fire with eternal repetition cost. Orientation anchored early (Elara in nebula garden). Gear discovery provides one meaningful tightening, reconfiguring generational transit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden's recursive geometry stretches sonar pings and slows petals, constraining choices and charging final dissolution image. Sensory details (phosphorescent pollen, sighing petals) selective via Elara's bias. Petals-as-Turing-bits evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share starlight sans extinction fire) signaled early via gear whisper; Accumulative escalation via ping distortion to lullaby reweights pattern as transformed cycle. Agency in frequency shift forecloses "breaking" option with conceptual cost of eternal guardianship legible in final smile. No live losses, but deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of light-as-preserved-information vs. consuming cycles emerges organically from gear lesson and petal encoding, repriced in closing realization "infinity itself was just another kind of fire." Ambiguity lingers in daughter's potential break. Final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (lineage of light, upward tears); voice modulates rhythmically from elegy to whisper-lullaby under pressure. Poetic compression taught early via mist/pollen, legible at CR closure. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short pings amid long drifts); high density in gear-spin beat does multiple jobs. Refrain "quiet sigh of falling petals" patterns as motif without loop penalty, but minor paraphrase in repetition ("fell, and fell") slightly dulls propulsion. No artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stardust Turing garden transforms generational curse into infinity-fire via gear-petals logic, risking lyric sci-fi boldness. Turn from decay to calculation feels inevitable from quantum loam cue. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully.</comment>
