<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation from duty-bound fortress to dancer's freedom feels earned through embodied urges like the whale's vibration compelling detachment. Contradictory impulses act in the guardian encounter, where she twists away yet offers palm. Final embrace of true nature shows hierarchy of values with cost of shedding old self, though some epiphanies lean summative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dock routine to island pulse-matching heartbeat, culminating in CR closure via realization and scrimshaw's warmth as token of unlocked hearts. Orientation anchored early in harbor docks; cost legible in "shed like old skin" and island's retreat foreclosing return to crates. One tightening via whale-summoned detachment narrows to freedom path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful—calloused feet on warm sand, tide's silver ribbons—constrain choices like guiding skiff over jagged rocks and charge final liminal dance image. Setting mirrors internal shift: dock planks tremble to island pulse. POV bias filters through dancer's grace, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of duty vs. true nature signaled early, tightens accumulatively via whale call urging detachment and guardian test, forcing renunciation with felt cost in embracing dance over crates. Agency in micro-choices like open palm narrows options; closure crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of strength/softness emerges organically from particulars: scrimshaw unlocks via "combative tenderness," whale song teaches harmony, final whisper reweights premise without moral. Resonant CR in liminal dancer image answers freedom question non-literally, lingering ambiguity of others' laughter vs. dreams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with dancer's perceptual signature: fluid motions etched in waves/whales scrimshaw. Rhythm modulates from dawn silhouette to swaying arcs, purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged poise. No head-hopping; diction biased to rhythm of waves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm suits lyric accumulative drive; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "ghost of the old world, a floating mound of sand and shadow" risks muddle but integrates without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffold clean; propulsion breathes with scene urgency to final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-violence myth with scrimshaw-pirate legend transformed via whale-summoned island and combative tenderness; disappearing sanctuary risks bold lyric structure, heightening stakes in liminal freedom without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight: whale call reconfigures duty as chain.</comment>
