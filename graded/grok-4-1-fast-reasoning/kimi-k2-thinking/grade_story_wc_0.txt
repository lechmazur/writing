<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like kneeling in damp fabric and releasing breath; contradictory impulses between analytical stripping and emotional patterns peak in the realization moment, earning the final renunciation of isolation with humility's cost. Mother's accusation anchors flaw without summary. Final text message reveals values hierarchy under work pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of decay patterns building to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "She would not return to document it" forgoing her instinct. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene with fluid transitions maintains coherence; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse details like watermarks and mold constrain observation and mirror internal shift; butterfly dust as recurring object charges final image under researcher's pattern-seeing bias. Sensory hierarchy favors tactility (knee soaking, moss squelch) fitting urgency. Spatial choreography clear from path to glass shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal vs. cosmic decay signaled early tightens accumulatively when butterfly touch reverses her preprocessing method, narrowing to epiphany with trade-off cost in texted admission. Agency in micro-choices like brushing dust forecloses prior stance. Pressure coheres texturally without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing noise/drama emerges organically from dust/prism images reweighting equations premise; final telescope "pocked with time" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like pulsar vs. butterfly avoid platitudes. Subtext in silence between observations builds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of spectral patterns; diction modulates from precise ("decay curves") to lyric under realization without register drift. Rhythmic compression in peak insight ("The drama was not needless") heightens pressure. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "patterns within patterns" advances theme/action); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, though "patterns" recurrence borders loop but serves taught motif. No scaffold, muddled metaphors, or template cadence in closure. Propulsion strong via image chaining.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics/micro-decay transforms epiphany trope; neutron star/greenhouse parallel feels inevitable, risk-taking in textural buildup heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; specifics like wing scales personalize universals.</comment>
