<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's infinite patience embodied in numb fingers tracing knots despite cold shows contradictory impulses under pressure; final recording choice earned by prior micro-choices. Kessler applies subtle relational pressure via watchful silence and tea. Minor reflective backstory on weavers tilts present without flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog, snow, and knot-tracing builds to CR closure in wisp-grass revelation, reweighting rope as living archive with patience cost legible in "handwriting steady despite cold that numbed her fingers." Orientation anchored early (dock, Elara, snow by para 1). Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (fog muffles, snow clicks, frost glazes) narrows to touch in crisis, constraining choices; fulgurite and rope as micro-settings charge final image. Cold numbs fingers during climax decode, mirroring internal focus. No generic placeholders—dock evolves with fog into whiteout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode weavers' knowledge) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density in knot variations to reversal at "three consecutive reversed loops"; agency in coaxing forecloses ignorance path with numb-finger cost. Fog/snow coherent pressures force tactile shift. One tightening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embedded preservation emerges from rope as "library of forgotten pollination," final journal entry/CR reweights premise without moralizing—"not taking it—gently pulling threads." Subtext in Kessler's trust transaction lingers ambiguity. No tidy binaries; complexity in invisible knowledge endures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (fiber language, ancestral threads) biases details; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It doesn't speak... It remembers") advances trust. Rhythmic modulation under pressure: short sentences in decode ("A double fisherman's knot, but..."). No head-hopping; voice poetic yet grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fog thickened, erasing... only lantern glow remained" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, no loops/templates. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("fractal fury... captured lightning") during peak but pattern-taught and legible. Propulsion clean to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot-cipher as living archive transforms trope of hidden knowledge; risk in lyric accumulative build pays off in irreplaceable rope-decode turn. No template echoes—wisp-grass payoff inevitable from particulars. Bold voice commits to oceanic hush without retreat.</comment>
