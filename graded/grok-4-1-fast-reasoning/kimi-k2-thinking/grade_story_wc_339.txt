<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quietly analytic trait roots motivation in precise micro-choices like noting "settling rate: a logarithmic decay," earning the final reclassification; Mort's presence forces relational pressure without overshadowing. Contradictory impulses surface in measuring grief's "vector of attachment" amid the globe's pull. Minor diagnostic phrasing in slate note ("Letting go occurs when") borders therapy-speak but embodies cost without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through observations to CR closure in "weight plus time, divided by acceptance," with conceptual cost legible in packing the globe as "artifact." Orientation anchors early ("three hundred feet below the Pacific," ship's library). Single scene holds without shards; pattern of measurements tightens to reweight memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's "decks colonized by anemones and sorrow" and dissolving logs constrain untangling; recurring globe charges final image as "fixed point he could carry." Sensory hierarchy (cold water cooling, drowned quiet) reflects analytic POV. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in porthole, chest, slate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, deepens via shaking globe's "turbulence" and Mort's nudge, narrowing to reclassification under Accumulative lens; agency in noting forecloses kinetic grief. One tightening sufficient; cost felt in "exhaustive mapping of its own tension." Visible price alters tactics from mourning to study.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of message persisting sans sender emerges organically from globe's "crystalline silence" and logs' "saltwater calculus," reweighting premise in final "potential memory" without moralizing. Subtext in Mort's "melancholy doesn't care about equations" invites ambiguity. Resonant CR answers via artifact image, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature analytic ("viscosity... refractive index"); voice modulates rhythm in "snow whirled... logarithmic decay." Dialogue subtextual, distinct (Mort patient, Cassian murmured); no head-hopping. Diction controlled, purposeful under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density ("each flake finding its level... diminishing returns") propels without loops; rhythm varies (short "That's turbulence" amid longer builds). Figurative layering ("singularity of memory") purposeful, no muddle in peak realization. Minor thread-metaphor repetition pattern-taught, not scaffold; closure image crisp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart globe, analytic diver, personified Mort transforms grief tropes into physics of attachment; risk in metaphorical precision heightens stakes. No derivatives; inevitability in "force required... equal to the force of will" from particulars. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
