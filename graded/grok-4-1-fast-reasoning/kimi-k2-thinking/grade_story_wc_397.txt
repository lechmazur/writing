<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in numbness and trembling hands reveals contradictory impulses toward ending vs. endurance; final renunciation of euthanasia earned via photo and ice sounds. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "grips reality loosely" borders label-speak but ties to micro-choice of pushing forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (ice cracks, groans, photo) tightens to Charged Poise closure where realization reconfigures ending as lullaby with felt cost of foreclosed suicide. Orientation anchored early in marina waking; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice floes and wind constrain choices (stepping out, trawling debris) and charge final silver path image; sensory hierarchy (hiss under boots, cold bite) mirrors internal yielding. Recurring marina details evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn endings vs. find life) signaled early, deepens via crack/photo reversal narrowing to renunciation; agency in endurance shows cost in smoothed patience fold. Accumulative cadence shift reweights with legible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of graceful endings emerges organically from ice sounds and parasol reprises, final image non-literally answering via "every ending could be a beginning" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing (crack, groan, hum); lyrical rhythm modulates pressure without head-hopping or register drift. Brief volunteer greetings natural and goal-free.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops in "sound of approaching endings" and ice groan/sigh repetitions dull propulsion slightly; no closure harm. Rhythmic variety supports read-aloud flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with Arctic volunteering transforms death trope via parasol/ice motif; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
