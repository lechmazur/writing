<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Narrator's persistent curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like following the pulse and rushing to the man, with embodied tension in trembling hands; internal conflict emerges mildly in blending dead/living but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at the climax save.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density of mist/pulses to causal twist (pulse is man's heart) as decisive change, with charged poise closure in photo smile and new pulse reconfiguring purpose; cost legible in "fragile thread" voice and trembling hands; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and hearing aid as micro-setting constrain visibility/hearing and charge final image (mist as guardian cloak, photo beacon); sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased, evolves with crash/dew; no white-room, purposeful selection mirrors internal hush-to-alive shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing/protecting pulses signaled early escalates accumulatively via density to crash tightening (options narrow from ghost to life-save); agency in rush/assure forecloses inaction path with felt cost (trembling hands); one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of blended living/dead voices emerges organically from pulses/photo twist, with final image (child's knowing smile, new pulse) as resonant reconfiguration reweighting listening's cost without moralizing; subtext in incidental save avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (pulses as chimes/moth wings) and rhythmic hush-motif hold under pressure, modulating to brighter lights/stretcher; stable POV, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm/syntax; minor patterned repetition ("mist curling," "faint pulse") motif-driven not looping; overwrought metaphors consistent without muddle, but occasional synonym churn ("whispers"/"voices") dulls slightly mid-build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-tracer premise via hearing aid twist into living heroism transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic hush-blend heightens stakes; final photo reconfiguration feels inevitable from pulses, no derivative hedging.</comment>
