<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kai's inquisitive devotion drives micro-choices like donning the goggles despite respectful distance, earning the closure realization; interiority particular via service details, contradictory grief/joy embodied in final desk moment. Blind spots (unseen impact of service) compound to poignant endurance. Final entry's "decryption key" line seals earned change with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via floors-as-years; orientation anchored in first para; tightening via goggles revelation resolves diary, building to CR closure where setting goggles forecloses ignorance with emotional cost legible in "affectionate detachment" image. Persistent constraint (altitude/light) shapes tactics through ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice spire's prismatic light constrains revelation (specific altitude/refraction needed), filtering through servant's priorities (service tools like goggles); evolves causally with sun gap, charging final empty quarters. Sensory selection (shuddering elevator, fractured colors) mirrors internal unveiling without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt captain's hidden joy) signaled via tucked diary, deepens accumulatively per floor with agency (tilting diary), foreclosing presumptuous ignorance; cost felt in intruding grief yet yielding validation, visible in tempered grief at peak. Minor abstraction in initial "mystery gnawed" slightly mutes visceral early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (attention reveals joy beneath anguish) emerges via diary layers, reweighted in final entry's "sun scattered in every crystal" without statement; resonant CR in desk image answers service's meaning organically. Subtext in unnoticed details (humming, tea steam) charges without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (service minutiae like map-folding, brass-polishing); diction/rhythm modulates ascent's building density to quiet poise. Perceptual bias (inquisitive lens on captain's script) selective; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (light patterns do double duty for plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm accelerates revelations, breathes in reflective pauses; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs (ice filigree purposeful). Closure line's "familiar cloak" propels with image precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Optical encryption via goggles/ice altitude transforms servant-devotion trope into fresh synthesis; floor-ascent structure risks non-causal but pays off in textured CR. Bold premise angle on hidden reciprocity feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
