<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment consistent and intensifies via swan choice; embodied emotions via silence mending threads particular, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in tunnel beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, motif density tightens through swan tunnel discovery to CR closure; conceptual cost legible in "burrow not into earth, but into silence" realization with fragile peace acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and swan micro-settings constrain choices (unfolding yields tunnel) and charge final floating image; sensory details (moss spines, ink pool) filtered through POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via glyphs chamber; agency in burrowing forecloses halt-decay path with on-page cost of endurance in crumbling peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of accompanying decay emerges organically from swan folds reprise; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting witness role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature of blurring reality; purposeful repetition taught early suits accumulative mode, though rhythm borders monotony under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("regenerative silence" x4, "drift of untold seasons" x3) and template cadence ("She [verb]" runs in return sequence) dull propulsion; redundancy pervades final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Origami swan as cryptic fold-map transforms preservation trope into silence-burrow lesson; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightening acceptance stakes.</comment>
