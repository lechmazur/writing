<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via memory of boy's face guiding hands, revealing contradiction between curator of endings and gift-giver; embodied in pocket's click and empty weight. Minor slip: "bruised awe" borders on label-speak without full embodiment in peak touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify to collapse; Charged Poise closure in "spiral collapse into its own center" with legible cost of puppet's dissolution and pocket's absence reconfiguring time's hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pane of hush and nested spirals constrain tracing and translation, charging final unwinding; ocean mirror reflects across presents, mirroring internal states through selective refraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vouchsafe lullaby as pattern) tightens via memory-deepening and geometric translation under textural lens; agency in placement and touch forecloses futures with cost in self-dissolution felt at "became the lullaby."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flawed mercy emerges from puppet cracks as pathways and silence-as-love; final image of breathing ocean and empty pocket reweights endings non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spirals as seashells, hush as pane) modulates rhythmically; stable close-third POV teaches pattern early, legible at dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("nested patterns," "beautifully flawed") taught as motif; minor paraphrase loops in repeated hush/awe phrasing dull peak refraction slightly (-0.4), but propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday trope via geometric lullaby and flawed ceramic axis; bold lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
