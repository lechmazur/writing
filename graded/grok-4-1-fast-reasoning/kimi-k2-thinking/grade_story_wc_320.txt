<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Touching the shard empties mind of "language, protocol, assumptions," revealing contradictory impulses between amplification and intuition, earning rewiring choice with cost of discarded armor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to "copper sang" reconfiguration; shard-as-seed CR lands on-page with cost of prior calibrations, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar perigee "pulling at bones" and swaying platform constrain timing/visibility of bare-wire tuning and rewiring, charging final gorge/towers image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stripping rig to "single copper wire" deepens stake from transmission to reception under accumulative lens, agency-driven with tears as unmistakable embodied cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Shard wasn't a message. It was a seed" reweights silence-empty premise non-literally, resonating via geometry-of-patience blueprint without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Practical perceptual signature ("Fantasy had no room for romance when signals were life and death") biases noticing, rhythmic control modulates hush-rush climax cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "hands grease-blackened, movements precise" propels without loops; metaphors cohere (hush as "presence erasing noise") in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Hollywood star fragment" as hush-seed blueprint transforms signal trope into geometry-of-patience, inevitable synthesis risking lyric practicality.</comment>
