<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority through Lira's embodied reactions like clutching the pearl amid faltering sight, with contradictory impulses (resist vs embrace shadows) culminating in earned choice to vessel the forces. Pilgrim as catalyst applies pressure without deep interiority, fitting single-POV scope. Minor abstraction in "deeper awareness" epiphany slightly undercuts full embodiment at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from pilgrim's arrival to crescendo, delivering Charged Poise closure when Lira opens hands for forces to inhabit pearl, reconfiguring certainty with felt cost of tinted sight. Orientation anchored early in cave/pilgrim intro. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave's musical pillars and bright darkness vividly constrain choices, mirroring Lira's internal paradox and charging final balance restoration. Sensory integration (chiming notes, shadowed light) purposeful, evolving with events like new melody. Recurring cave/pearl as micro-setting shapes climax tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of magnifying magic vs unpredictability signaled early, escalates texturally through sight clouding and shadow coalescence, tightening to Lira's renunciation with on-page cost of embraced uncertainty. Pilgrim's word as single reversal coheres under lens. Agency in final choice forecloses resistance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing bright darkness emerges organically from cave paradox and Lira's arc, with final pearl habitation offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting certainty. Subtext in shadows/forces implies complexity without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person POV with Lira's perceptual signature (visions as river/stone) and poetic rhythm modulating intensity. Minimal dialogue (pilgrim's word) echoes cave voice effectively. No head-hopping; diction fits fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops like repeated "overlapping shadows" and "steadily unpredictable" (three mentions) create minor churn, deducting -0.6; no closure touch. Figurative coherent (cave as symphony), syntax varies. Read-aloud flows despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms crystal cave tropes via steadily unpredictable forces and pearl magnification, with pilgrim as quiet fulcrum risking bold lyricism. Final image of settled rhythm feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universality.</comment>
