<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via stubborn spark refusing smothering and mantra under empty sky pressure; micro-choices like tracing mosaic reveal values hierarchy with felt endurance cost. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to fire helix climax as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring hopelessness with legible cost (charred rag coil). Orientation anchored early at arrival; single continuous scene fits defaults. Closure image of glowing fortress and "We rise" whisper seals before/after with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (floral masking mortar, clink amid rustle) filtered through Cinder's priorities guides choices to mosaic arch. Recurring fortress vines/stones mirror defiance, constraining navigation; kerosene rag as micro-setting charges final image. Body awareness (boots crunch) evolves with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness gravity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sound-filter to mosaic discovery deepening to fire bloom affecting watchers. Agency in striking flint forecloses rag's future with visible cost. Lacks one live option foreclosure for 9+ under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of igniting hope emerges organically from particulars like violet flame helix echoing mosaic "Rise," reweighting starless void without moralizing. Final image of ember trail and heart-fire offers resonant non-literal answer to defiance question. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ambient filtering, chant-weaving contours); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to helix burst, reflecting mind under pressure. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety supports lyric propulsion, but figurative density (tar gravity, coiled spring, helix dancer) borders overwriting in build-up without mid-beat restraint, dulling peak slightly. Minor paraphrase loops (smile/chant recurrences) and template stems in reflections apply -0.6; no closure touch. Strong verbs/images overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks designer igniting literal/metaphoric hope in mosaic-prompted fortress transforms tropes organically; risk-taking poetic accumulative frame heightens stakes via starless hush. Final ember dust trail feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
