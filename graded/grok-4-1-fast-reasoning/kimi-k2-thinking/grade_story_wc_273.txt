<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "calm anger in his chest flared, a quiet fire" leashing wildness during drone loss; final endurance to chase patterns earned via prior micro-choice to spill ink. Minor label-speak in "consciously wild" slightly genericizes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from drone spill to floor spiral shimmer, yielding Charged Poise closure in "secret of time’s slowness lay hidden in those fleeting patterns" with cost of drone's ghost legible in final resting place image. One tightening via replication suffices; vignette mode holds without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind-carved stone and dunes constrain via etched walls/eyes sensitive to glare, mirroring internal carving; final "wind resumed its relentless carving" charges closure image, integrating setting purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher time distortion via crisis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ink spills narrowing to poised replication; agency in deliberate pouring forecloses recovery option with felt loss cost in "ghost of a vanished drone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of crisis-time hidden in ephemera emerges implicitly via ink patterns repricing mentor recall against present shimmer; final resolve reweights without moralizing, resonant in "unanswered question louder than any scream."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in distortion-catching albino eyes and pattern focus; rhythmic modulation heightens introspective pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Purposeful motif repetition ("ephemeral patterns," "serene anger") borders paraphrase loops in peak spill beats, dulling shimmer climax density; strong propulsion elsewhere, but −0.8 artifact cap for final-third churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink sigils vanishing drone/tech into time-perception quest transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract crisis replication pays off in poised ingenuity.</comment>
