<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between reason and instinct culminates in earned pillar touch with embodied terror and certainty; micro-choices like following glyphs reveal values under pressure. Minor slip in label-like "analytically artistic mind" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from glyphs to fortress entry; clear orientation by para 2; Charged Poise closure at pillar touch reconfigures stance with legible emotional cost ("trembled... terrified and absolutely certain").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory progression (ozone/iron air, phosphorescent glyphs) filters through mapper's bias, constraining path choices; mist vault and crystallized memories charge final pillar image, mirroring internal truths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (instinct vs. maps) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glyph dare to fortress confrontation; agency in punch-door and pillar touch forecloses avoidance with felt terror cost charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mapping absences to unspoken truths emerges organically via glyph patterns and pillar touch; final realization ("its architect") offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (notes in grates, calligraphy in escapes); rhythmic texture modulates from analytical to lyrical under rising mist pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but figurative overload in entry beat ("constellations pressed close... liquid mercury") borders coherence slip without payoff, dulling climax momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phantom punch unlocking glyph-guided fortress of truths transforms urban decay trope; risk in surreal vault physics heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
