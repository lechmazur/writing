<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to discover connection drives consistent micro-choices like weaving despite unrest, with embodied fever and internal shift to letting go earned by climax. Contradictory control-seeking yields to eruption without unearned epiphany. Minor flaw: final realization borders on abstract summary, but cost in empty hands and broken fever feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of illusions, threads, memories builds to pattern break (false memory, water eruption), reconfiguring premise in CR closure. Orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via taut thread suffices. Cost legible in "gallery could not abide such violence" and receding water leaving depth without reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rippling geometries, dust motes colliding, salt-smelling water) filter through Mira's priorities, constraining weave and charging final empty mirrors. Gallery breathes and shifts, mirroring internal states via action. Body as micro-setting: fever-hot fingers trace patterns pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection via weave) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to wrong connection's eruption narrowing control option. Agency in persistent weaving and surrender forces trade-off; cost in dissolving thread and broken fever unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ungraspable connection emerges organically from weave-flood-reconfiguration, with final image ("precise weight of a gaze") offering non-literal CR answer reweighting premise. Subtext in "rational enchantment" flickering enriches without statement. No moralizing; ambiguity in new thread lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: biased toward synaptic patterns and dream-logic. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from calm weave to taut vibration under stress. Purposeful compression in memories ("child's laugh from 1973") taught early, legible at surreal flood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration (e.g., "stairs that led nowhere" woven into action). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("walls breathed...lungs") during peak but pattern-consistent, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-weaving in illusion gallery transforms surreal tropes via rational rules and CR eruption. Risky surreal escalation (upward flood) heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious moral calculus on control inevitability feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
