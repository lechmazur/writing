<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction at rust stain dilemma, where impulses to report or silence clash bodily via warming bolt; final signing choice earned by regen and penance causality with lifelong vigilance cost. Micro-choices like pressing bolt reveal values hierarchy. No diagnostic speak; embodied flaws drive ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from past collapse to new stain discovery, closure as Charged Poise RR in precentor's nod and tool gesture reconfiguring vigilance as eternal life-cost ("you never stopped paying"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via higher rust stain suffices. Cost legible in final bolt replacement intent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spiral staircase and bolt constrain penance climb and final repair choice; cobalt walls/snow charge isolation and "frostbitten hope" image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (discoloration/rusts via returning nerves). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (report vs. silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to stain micro-turn forcing trade-off; agency in signing forecloses cowardice path with vigilance cost crystallized on-page. Moral calculus between self-position and collective harmony sharpens peak. Persistent bolt constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance-as-lifelong-payment emerges organically from silence motifs and stain callbacks, final image/tool gesture offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like Milo's crushed hands ground complexity; earned irony via past blindness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "seraphically mundane" lens and nerve-specific noticing; rhythmic modulation accelerates to descent/signing climax. Signs as "dialogue" carry subtext naturally. No elision; diction reflects regen-thaw without register drift.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., snow as "mourner's hands" advances atmosphere/stakes); varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion, zero loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful/selective, no muddle in peak stain beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of monastic gesture-world with nerve-regen penance transforms silence trope into vigilance economy; risk in accumulative reflection payoff heightens stakes via irreplaceable bolt/relic. Non-obvious "unpardonable silence" calculus feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
