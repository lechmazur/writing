<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and painterly, with embodied ache driving micro-choices like touching threads; change earned as hands shift from trembling to thrumming with phantom cost. Minor diagnostic edge in rhetorical loops slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rumor to thread visions to weaving; RR closure in knot loosening and box sealing, cost legible in "phantom hum beneath her nails."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting of breathing walls and weeping mortar constrains untangling and charges final exhale; beam through window reconfigures light/shadow, body (hands) as pivotal tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of escaping pivot tightens accumulatively as walls close, forcing weave with agency; cost felt in questioned "diminished truth" and retained ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of darkness/light collaboration emerges organically from thread-weaving and final portrait resolve; resonant non-literal answer in "shadow and light...collaborators" reweights art without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with painterly perceptual signature ("light from shadow on canvas"); rhythmic modulation suits lyric accumulation, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but rhetorical question loops ("Did hunger explain...?") create minor paraphrase drag in mid-beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot threads as timelines in lighthouse pivot transforms fragmentation trope; risk of lyric redesign pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
