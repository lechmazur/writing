<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—mind traces proofs while heart feels wingbeat silence—and final violet offering earns realization with prior cost of "softness carved away." Secret sentimentality shown via pressed flowers marking brutal equations reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. No unearned epiphanies; change feels particular to her alchemical struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crystal/flame meeting to starlings matching sound wave, culminating in CR where crystal shatters upward, reweighting premise of forced alignment into natural dance, with cost of predecessors' voids and her sacrifices legible in final warm shard. Single continuous scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Orchard's silver apples, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and starlings constrain choices—discovered via impossible starling, site enables harmony ritual—and charge final image of shards as new stars. Sensory details (humming apples, singing crystal) filtered through alchemical POV, evolve with events without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition before transformation) signaled early, tightens via protagonist's agency: placing crystal in flame, offering violet, witnessing patterns dissolves separation. Escalation under Accumulative lens reweights via deepening realization; cost unmistakable in shattered crystal and prior "pieces of herself" foreclosing void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chaos/order as lovers emerges implicitly from starlings' spirals solving equations and crystal's song recognized by apples; final image of intertwined equations/petals offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in sentimental violets amid brutal calculations embraces complexity, avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: alchemical lyricism ("glacier remembering cloud") biases noticing patterns/geometries; rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory to post-realization poise. No POV leakage; purposeful compression of wonder taught early pays off in legible CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wings wrote spirals and toruses" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor figurative density in peak (crystal/flame union) risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught via motifs, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical logic vs. starling chaos into "dance" harmony, with orchard's roots drinking both; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via irreplaceable images like violet-deep flame. No derivative tropes; turns inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
