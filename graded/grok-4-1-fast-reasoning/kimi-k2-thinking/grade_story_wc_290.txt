<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Claustrophobia powerfully embodied in descent ("walls began to close in... claustrophobic grip of panic"), with compass anchoring micro-choices; final triumph earned via prior struggle. Minor epiphanic summary at close ("true treasure was the knowledge") dilutes but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to door reveal and CR closure ("traced a new line across a blank blueprint"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "trembling not from fear but... wistful rebellion." Tightening at organ crescendo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Compass point as micro-setting constrains pivotal choice ("aligned... pressed"); starlit nexus and organ reverberation evolve causally, mirroring internal states through action; sensory hierarchy (sound-dominant) sharpens climax without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key amid claustrophobia) signaled early, escalates via panic deepened by walls' "malevolent will"; agency in pressing compass forecloses panic path with felt cost; lens-consistent density reweights to realization under accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining confines emerges organically via particulars (compass piercing stone to new blueprint); final image offers resonant CR without moralizing; "wistful rebellion" echoes constrain closure without overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (geometric/sonic bias under stress); lyrical rhythm modulates tension effectively; no head-hopping, voice coherent despite poetic elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering ("sonic tempest," "metallic whisper") in climax borders overwriting but pattern-taught; ending paraphrase loops ("wistful rebellion," "spatial mutiny" reprise without propulsion) dull closure image, capping density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Organ-as-map and compass geometry synthesize fresh explorer arc; risk in sensory guidance heightens stakes organically; transforms trope via "spatial mutiny" premise without gimmick.</comment>
