<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in reverence drives mental navigation, embodied in stone-handling and stillness; interiority concrete via pulse alignment. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, smoothing the realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to birds' spiral tightening and pulse alignment as CR closure; cost legible in foreclosed physical paths. Orientation anchored early in canyon; single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (harmonics, dust dance, bird patterns) constrains movement and charges final temporal map image. Bone towers and rose quartz evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mental navigation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird signal and tone layering narrowing to comprehension. Agency in deliberate stone skim forces stance crystallization with stillness cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as ultimate journey emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in final arrowhead warmth without moralizing. Resonant CR answers central question via canyon's multi-temporal reveal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct reverent perceptual signature (patterns in echoes/birds); lyrical rhythm modulates intensity purposefully. No dialogue; purposeful elision taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images; "centuries of layered dust" motif repetition serves pattern without looping. Minor scaffold in adjacent echo descriptions, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal navigation via harmonics/birds transforms fantasy tropes into inevitable lyric epiphany. Risky stillness premise commits fully, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
