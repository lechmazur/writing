<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving descent and actions to completion of glass; interiority concrete in embodied pangs like "salt-soaked heart" but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on poetic summaries over micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from shard flicker to plant growth and glass completion; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "paths were not erased by malice but reclaimed by the sea's own memory," reweighting premise with felt cost of "cheerful gloom"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via seeds suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iridescent cave and geode constrain choices (pressing glass, scattering seeds in cracks, extracting from matrix) and charge final glow; sensory details selective and POV-biased toward memory echoes, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; quick test passed with environment shaping tactics and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover path loss cause) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via flickering images dissolving to plant-revealed alcove under lens; agency in conjectured descent, seed scattering, extraction narrows options with deepening knowledge; cost legible in dissolving trails' sorrow before harmonious revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's cycle emerges organically from particulars like foam, seeds, glass symphony; final tide pool image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loss as transformation without moralizing; quick test met, no thematic echo or platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of briny, shimmering bias; rhythmic prose modulates from descent tension to luminous cadence; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "slender shoots erupted, each leaf a tiny mirror" advancing image/action; rhythm varies read-aloud, minor synonym churn in "glow"/"luminous" purposeful for accumulative texture; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist, emotion-transliterating glass, swallow-seeds transforms memory trope into inevitable cycle; risk in lyric fantasy world logic heightens stakes coherently; quick test met with non-obvious turns like seeds revealing shards feeling organic.</comment>
