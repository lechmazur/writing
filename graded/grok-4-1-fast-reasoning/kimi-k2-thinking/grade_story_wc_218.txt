<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in diagnosis and diary, compelling micro-choices like weaving vines over cutting, with embodied weakening hands revealing struggle. Internal calm endures without contradiction, earning translation choice. Minor lack of simultaneous impulses acting in peak fever beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of orchard responses builds to CR closure in "orchard exhaled... pillars glowed," reweighting death as translation with conceptual cost of bodily loss. Orientation anchored early in diagnosis walk; time elisions motivated by systematic work. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Temple orchard's pillars, oaks, and copper constrain wrapping tactics (quadrants, bark grain) and charge final glowing image. Sensory details (warm pulse, leaf whispers, biolum moss) filtered through caretaker POV, selective and purposeful. Micro-setting of wire and stone evolved causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete network for translation) signaled in diary marginalia, deepens accumulatively via intensifying responses (gecko, parrots, whispers) that narrow timeline vs. weakening body. Agency in persistent wrapping forecloses death-as-failure with on-page cost of shaking hands in final clamp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-translation emerges organically from wire spirals, interspecies signals, to final diary entry "Respect... in translation," reweighting monument to embassy without statement. Complexity in non-cure acceptance lingers via new caretaker's marginalia. Final image offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV Elias with clean terminal shift; perceptual signature botanical/systematic (bark grain, quadrant maps). Rhythmic diction ("brazen calm... gently systematic") modulates intensity without drift. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "copper sang... pillars shiver" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor purposeful repetition ("gently systematic," "pulse") taught as voice motif avoids loops. Slight paraphrase in repeated "stone warmed... pulse" descriptions nudges below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of terminal diagnosis, bio-architecture, and consciousness translation transforms inheritance trope via specific wire mechanics and interkingdom embassy. Risky eco-mystic premise commits fully, with final humming orchard inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
