<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in discovering collective grief's shape, embodied through meditative tracing and spiral carving choice; interiority concrete via ribbon textures and path loops. Daughter's brief entry adds familial continuity without diluting Kael's arc. Minor flaw: grandmother's ghost feels slightly archetypal, lacking a sharper blind spot before final approval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon patterns and retraced paths build density to Conceptual Repricing closure ("the shape... in the spaces between the words"), with felt cost in tension/release of woven grief. Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse/monarchs. Single tightening via repeated poems forming topography suffices; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via dusk paths, corpse flower stench mirroring rot/beauty, and butterfly clusters bending light into prayer—charges final empty flight paths image. Sensory hierarchy (visual flickering, olfactory decay) reflects Kael's meditative priorities. Orchid leaves dusted with stone constrain tactile carving evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's shape) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ribbon topography discovery narrowing from generic to spiral form. Agency in retracing loops forces trade-off (individual vs. collective), with cost in foreclosed linear names. Tightening reweights via daughter's poem integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief as spiral/woven emerges organically from ribbon fragments, butterfly migration, and river loss—resonant non-literal answer in spiraled stone touched by villagers. Subtext in ghost's "not a line... a spiral" recharges priors without moralizing. Complexity lingers in tension/release ambiguity.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (fiercely meditative patterns in air); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged dusk scenes. Ghost dialogue natural/subtextual ("Grief isn't a line"), advances stakes. Prose texture poetic yet controlled, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying sentences evoke meditative loops); metaphors consistent (wings as flames, grief spiral) without muddle in peak retracing beats. Minor paraphrase loops ("retracing" thrice) purposeful for pattern, not scaffold. Propulsion strong, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral poem-ribbons, and butterfly migration transforms grief trope into spiral topography—inevitable hindsight via family custom. Bold lyric risk (migration timeframe) heightens stakes without gimmick; fresh thundering calm tone.</comment>
