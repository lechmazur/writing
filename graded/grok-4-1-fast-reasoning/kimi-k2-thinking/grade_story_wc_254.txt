<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but abstractly poetic without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies like "tremor of certainty was not a single moment, but a continuous hum" feel declarative rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. No real internal conflict or flaws complicating choices; motivation aligns but lacks embodied contradiction at pivotal touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from entry to lake-center realization; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in final image of blurring lines with felt conceptual cost of perpetual crossing. Continuous scene fits scope; one tightening via pillar touch to lake walk suffices, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective (quartz hum blurs skin/stone, ice crackles mirroring hush); cobalt atrium and lake constrain choices (graze pillar, walk ice as canvas) and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (aesthetic bias to vibration/metaphor); coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve boundaries aesthetically post-ban) signaled early but remains abstract/textural without viscerally felt tightening; pillar touch deepens under lens but forecloses no live option with unmistakable price. No opposition, agency in steps/whispers lacks trade-off at climax verse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of aesthetic dissolution emerges organically from hum/ice images shifting to infinite threshold; final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like breath-cloud shadow; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (aesthetic noticing of shadow/light edges); voice lyrical and consistent, modulating softly with immersion. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful poetic compression legible, but minor register elevation in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("dissolving boundaries" x8+, "paraphrase" x3, "hum"/"tremor" redundant across beats) and template cadence ("She [action], [poetic clause]" runs) dull propulsion, obscuring closure image; overwriting with metaphors every line in peak beats erodes density. Minor scaffold in repetitive stems touches ending hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-in-atrium surrealism transforms boundary trope via quartz hum/vibration; specific images like lantern-moth hush memorable. Risks lyric accumulation effectively, but prose-poem familiarity tempers boldness.</comment>
