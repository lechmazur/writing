<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's cautiously hopeful trait evolves from naivety to weaponized resolve, compelling her interference with embodied stress in sleepless nights and switch-flip. Interior contradiction shines in balancing hope against vulture-like funding threats. Minor slip: epiphany on tricksters' nature feels slightly told before fully dramatized, but pivotal choice remains earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: signal patterns densify to counter-broadcast climax, scattering interference as Charged Poise closure with cost in ongoing vigilance. Orientation anchors early in booth/campus split. Single scene fits defaults; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Booth's ozone/vinyl/coffee grit and peeling walls constrain risky recalibration; charts as recurring "micro-setting" charge final sigil image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's astronomical bias narrowing to equipment vibrations under crisis. Purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt trickster division-harvest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern-tracing to subsonic interference during live debate peak. Agency in switch-flip forecloses hysteria with equipment/community cost legible. One deepening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of exploited division emerges organically from signal-harvested arguments to final wary dialogue; ending image reweights hope as stubborn endurance without moralizing. Cosmic indifference vs. human grit resonates through particulars like protest-timed pulses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: astronomical filtering (spectrograms warping, star clusters pulsing). Voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive buildup to terse climax ("flipped the switch"). Chen's intrusion clean, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors like "cosmic gaslighting" purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Minor figurative density early ("vultures," "dead skin") but supports ethereal grit; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subsonic alien psyops via campus radio transforms contact trope into gaslighting harvest, with risk-taking in sonic mirror payoff heightening stakes organically. Non-obvious moral calculus (human grudges outlast scheme) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
