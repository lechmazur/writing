<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority through glow as embodied trait and micro-choices like sidereal counting reveal values under pressure; skepticism evolves into lantern via earned realization. Minor slip in overt epiphany at "her skepticism had not been a shield, but a lantern," bordering diagnostic but tied to climax action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to geese pause; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly on "latch unclicked... memories spilled," reweighting city's silence with felt cost of prior neglect. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fountains and cobblestones constrain journey and charge final image of revived water; sensory details like "rust colored evening" and glass mosaic filtered through Kael's glow create lived-in specificity that mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early tightens via sidereal wait and pause, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in pressing lid forecloses neglect path with legible cost in her "quiet triumph." One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory's defiant flow emerges organically from particulars like swirling light and mingling glows; final image of "defiant hush... silence could be a choice, not a cage" offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in star/heartbeat rhythms; voice modulates poetically under pressure, perceptual bias toward luminescence coherent and biased to Kael's skepticism-turned-belief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm; purposeful repetition of "glow" and "hush" taught as pattern charges closure without loops obscuring cause/effect. Minor paraphrase in adjacent "quiet" phrases ("quiet urgency... quiet shadows") dulls one beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic mythos with cosmic/geese mechanics feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via irreplaceable "pause" constraint, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
