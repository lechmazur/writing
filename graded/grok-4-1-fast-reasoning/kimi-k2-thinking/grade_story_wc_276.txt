<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cool-headedness tested by divine sadness in echo's rise creates contradictory impulses acting in scene; release earned by prior spike-mediated grief ping and lullaby. Interiority concrete via embodied vibrations; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden waves to spike beacon, echo rise, lullaby tightening to CR closure (release reconfigures catching as witnessing) with residual grief cost legible in spike's hum. Orientation anchored early; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden constrains zigzag path and spike site; rail spike as micro-setting charges final image (hums grief into grace). Sensory hierarchy (vibrations exhaling color) reflects fisher's priorities; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch Echo) signaled early, deepens via spike recognition and lullaby under textural lens, narrowing to release trade-off; cost in carried grief forecloses possession. Climax echo's question forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of possession-to-witnessing emerges via spike's transliteration shift and final seed image reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (zigzag mimicry, voiced silence) yield resonant CR; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vibration-focused noticing; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (shortened at spike drive). Stable close third-person; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (long undulating descriptives to spike's sharp "ping"). Heavy figuration coherent via transliteration motif, no muddle or loops, though pervasive in climax slightly risks overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo mythology with sound-wave synesthesia and spike transduction transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes via pattern breaks, inevitable at release image.</comment>
