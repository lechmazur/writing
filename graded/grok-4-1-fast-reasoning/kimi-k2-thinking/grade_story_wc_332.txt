<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to capture the dream intensifies through failed bridge and successful vessel, earning release with embodied cost in the empty well. Contradictory impulses act in the summit scene, balancing trap vs. vitalize. Minor slip in abstract epiphany ("palette didn't bind dreams but gave them language") borders diagnostic but ties to prior action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via light-painting failures to CR closure in empty well's "luminous loss," reweighting capture as release with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (librarian, escaped dream, archipelago). One tightening—bridge dissolution—forces vessel tactic, pattern pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago constrains ascent (volcanic rock "slick with meaning") and directs (islands as question marks), charging final image of resettling dust and echoing voices. Sensory details selective (mist as regret, silver hooves on waves) mirror internal states through POV. Micro-setting (palette, camera) evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens via bridge failure narrowing options to release, with agency in exposures and strokes foreclosing possession path. Cost legible in dissolving work and permanent empty well under Accumulative lens. Escalation driven by librarian's adaptations, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of longing as true subject emerges organically from failed capture to "capture by letting them go," resonant CR in empty well without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material (runaway dream teaches release). Subtext in cipher pulses and palette's absence invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to dream-tending (dream as "translucent deer made of longing"). Rhythm modulates with intensity (short summit sentences), purposeful repetition ("hush of improbable beginnings") taught early. No head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but patterned repetition ("luminous absence," "hush of improbable beginnings") borders loop in final third without full payoff, dulling propulsion slightly (−0.9). Figurative density coherent in peak (shutter click "split darkness") but pervasive. Rhythmic variety strong, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-library archipelago with light-painting transforms tropes (runaway dream) via specific rules (memory pigments, camera vitalizing). Risky lyric structure heightens stakes in release cycle, inevitable hindsight from cipher setup. No derivatives, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
