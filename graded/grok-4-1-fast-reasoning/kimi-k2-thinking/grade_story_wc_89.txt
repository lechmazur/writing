<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Embodied reluctance shines in "hands trembled... reluctant metamorphosis" and transformation climax; steady trait enables ritual but lacks deeper flaws or blind spots driving micro-choices that compound pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from gathering to ritual inhalation; resonant reconfiguration closure lands cleanly in "bond reforged beyond death" with legible form-loss cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's glowing blossoms and spice plants constrain gathering/ritual choices and charge final "padded into the moonlit grove"; sensory filter (scents over sights) reflects whisperer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens via ritual cadence shift to metamorphosis; agency in spice circle forces trade-off of human form, cost visible in "bones shifting, heartbeat slowing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent love-through-change emerges organically from spice memories and final double heartbeat; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing despite fortune quote integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in scent/beast focus; rhythmic poetic diction modulates during transformation stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload (starlight/cinnamon spirals) in peak transformation beat dulls immediacy; minor moon motif loops and final-paragraph paraphrase (bond/laughter echoes) drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh fortune-cookie prophecy in fairy-tale ritual transforms tropes; cookie slip's fading ink reprise risks poignancy without gimmick.</comment>
