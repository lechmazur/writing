<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's loss drives soldering and activation, with embodied pull of censer foot showing struggle; however, interiority leans abstract ("geography of loss") without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal building beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as midnight calls and waxing moon layers build to "Now" activation; closure RR via sister's voice and dimming foot lands on-page with legible emotional cost in tears and fragile peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salvage-lined station and frozen dish constrain building choices, with starlit sky mirroring fractured mind; censer foot as micro-setting charges final anchor image, though sensory narrowed to tactile/ visual effectively filters urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bridge void signaled early, escalates via heavier foot and layered calls under accumulative lens to activation tightening; cost felt in tears as raw solace forecloses barren map path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of loss navigated emerges via bridge of signal, with final star-home image offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting moon-guided premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-3rd POV, with perceptual bias toward celestial/pull motifs and rhythmic modulation suiting accumulative build; no head-hopping, diction controlled despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High figurative density ("black tide lapping," "silent scream") risks overwriting in building beats without obscuring causality, but purposeful lunar/weight motifs propel; minor paraphrase loops in "weight" imagery deduct slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Censer foot as lunar compass ingeniously synthesizes salvage/resonator for reverse migration, transforming loss tropes via specific moon-phased pull; fresh premise inevitable in hindsight, risk in poetic compression pays off at closure.</comment>
