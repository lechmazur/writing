<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied emotion via vibrations and refractions feels particular to blind artisan; micro-choices like calling for platinum patch reveal hierarchy of calm expertise under deadline. Minor weakness: no shown contradictory impulses during repair climax, just steady competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from diagnosis to test chamber success; closure as Charged Poise in final water demo reconfigures "seeing" as interpretation with night's pressure as felt cost. Orientation anchored in opening lines; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mercury basin and water sphere constrain diagnosis, filtering light into fault lines that charge final bubble image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (vibration/temperature over sight); depot mist evolves to frame departure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair before dawn) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ship horn blasts forcing endurance; cost legible in rib-echoing deadline. No reversal, but agency in methodical patching narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of navigating brokenness via distortion emerges organically; final "bubble could bend a beam into a map" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in refraction/vibration diction; rhythmic modulation accelerates in repair beats. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("How did you know?" reveals Kael's arc); stable third-limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm; figurative language ("fingertips lingering... cool metal") purposeful but clusters in repair beat slightly blur propulsion. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness + optical diagnostics transforms repair trope; risk in water-feature methods heightens ingenuity, feels inevitable in final demo.</comment>
