<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in palm-on-trunk recall of wife's hand, earning final endurance; minor therapy-speak like "somatic marker activated" slightly abstracts emotion without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as somatic layers densify to Charged Poise closure in descent with photo's "heartbeat"; cost legible in holding "shadow and smile," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliff arboretum's bark grooves and salt wind constrain somatic choices, charging final eucalyptus freeze; sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's pattern bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of somatic preservation tightens accumulatively via sketches to freeze, foreclosing retreat with felt cost of realism; agency clear in micro-freeze endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pearl of stillness emerges organically from grit/tree interactions, final image reweights premise with non-literal resonance of "boat anchored in what had actually happened."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (patterns in chaos) stable in single POV; curator dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates to charged poise without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful "pearl" recurrence pattern-taught, no loops dulling freeze beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Somatic-tree synthesis transforms grief trope freshly; arboretum-as-lighthouse risk heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
