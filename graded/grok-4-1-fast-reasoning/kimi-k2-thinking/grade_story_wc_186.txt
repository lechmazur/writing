<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in proving coincidences' meaning, embodied via heartbeat matching pavilion hum and visions constraining choices; interiority concrete through retrocognitive fragments acting under pressure. Final positioning choice earned by prior causality with felt endurance cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly tempers from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions/patterns tightens to CR closure at "Light exploded upward, a silent column piercing the night," reweighting coincidence as pattern with conceptual cost of narrow perspective foreclosed. Orientation anchored early (custodian, tower post-collapse). One meaningful deepening via conjunction wait suffices; constraint of star alignment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's humming panes and star paths on ceiling constrain positioning choice and charge final image, with sensory selection (thrum matching heartbeat) filtered through POV urgency. Post-collapse wasteland evolves to travelers' convergence. Micro-setting (shard/prism) tactilely lived-in, mirroring internal realization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle/prove meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vision density to conjunction/deepening that narrows to shard rotation agency; cost legible in "stray breath, mote of dust" convergence forcing precise alignment. Climax tests commitment with visible trade-off (silence into light). Coherent pressure crystallizes stance without resolution by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences as deeper order emerges organically from visions/star paths/prism, with final CR image of beacon/travelers reweighting premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, but mild echo in "coincidence was merely pattern seen from too narrow a perspective" borders statement, docking from peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light shards as time lens, hush paradox); lyrical rhythm modulates from thrum buildup to explosive silence peak. Compression of visions purposeful and taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue; diction biased to glass/star idiom reflects custodian's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies to accelerate alignment ("With steady hands, she rotated..."); motifs like humming/thistle taught as pattern without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("coincidence... meaning" echoes across ending) dull closure slightly (-0.4), but read-aloud rhythm natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hush-shard silence-to-light, post-collapse geometry of repair transforms beacon trope organically. Final reconfiguration (beacons answering) inevitable from star paths/coincidences. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
