<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in sensory details like steam coiling fingers but undermined by unearned epiphanies such as "closure was not an ending but a reading"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with realizations told rather than shown through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from coffee rings to fern revelation to pebble discovery; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "scars... verses in a poem of survival" with conceptual cost of passages traveled only once; orientation anchored early, one tightening via fern suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (cool stone, moss breath, pool lapping) filtered through scar-reading bias; recurring pebble constrains choice by pulsing warmth and charges final image of internalized miracle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reading scars signaled early, deepens accumulatively via fern-enabled tunnel to pebble; agency in entering passage forecloses prior uncertainty with felt cost in shimmering scars, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of healing through reading scars emerges organically from coffee rings mapping to pebble pulse; final image of hourglass as "liquid silver" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting wounds as poetry, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with scar-centric perceptual signature (e.g., rings as "map of scars"); rhythmic modulation fits dawn hush but capped by Q7 artifacts; no head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "stories in scars" and repetitive stems ("Elara realized," "She understood") in final third dull closure image; overwriting with stacked metaphors like "sand... liquid silver" in peak beats reduces density without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anesthesia-induced plant telepathy and scar-reading transforms closure tropes into lyric CR; risk-taking in accumulative image density heightens stakes without gimmickry, though prose artifacts temper.</comment>
