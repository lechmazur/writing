<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's gift and isolation drive consistent motivation, with embodied interiority in "faint pulse of borrowed memories seeping into his skin." Minor tidiness in final realization softens contradictory impulses under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure in "the stranger's final gesture was not a question but a gift," with conceptual cost of witnessed isolation legible in final beam image. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain observation and charge closure as Cornelius paces planks, mirroring internal gaps; sensory hierarchy (amber glow, alpine scent) filters through POV. Recurring mist evolves to envelop secrets, heightening final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture signaled early, deepens via "observing gaps" reversal that reweights meaning under Accumulative lens. Agency in sifting memories forecloses misreading with felt cost of "quiet desperation"; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed isolation emerges organically from boutonniere memory and lighthouse pulse, with CR end-image "lighthouse beam seemed warmer" reweighting premise without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in whispering shadows and pulsing echoes; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically. No head-hopping; compression in memory sifting taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("softly persistent") patterns effectively early but risks paraphrase loop by end; minor template cadence in memory flashes ("first came... then the flash"). Dense propulsion holds, but density slips in high-pressure sifting dull closure slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry gift in lighthouse isolation transforms ghost-story tropes via gap-observing method; risk in lyric CR pays off in "memory is the true keeper of light" without gimmick.</comment>
