<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's embodied regret ("cerulean regret... colored every thought") and micro-choices (tracing spirals, wrapping wire) reveal contradictory impulses, earning her final recognition of growth around wounds. Hideo's traits pressure her patience without stereotypes. Voice distinct in dialogue and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual density deepens from compass pulse to needle settling under pot, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("severances heal... by growing around the wound") with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored by ferry/islet (~50 words). Two shards cohere with legible time jumps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai/juniper as micro-setting constrains ritual choices and charges final image ("needles... tint of blue-green"). Sensory details (mist like silk, lapis shimmer) filter through Mara's priorities, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal severance via remembrance) tightens accumulatively through ritual (wire wrapping narrows resistance), forcing endurance with cost (three seasons, longing absorbed). Agency in Mara's hands-on work; cost legible in compass cooling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of diffused regret emerges organically via color/tides motifs, answered non-literally in final image ("color... moving through the leaves like tide water"). No moralizing; complexity in ongoing presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tides, diffusion, colors) stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual ("tides of remembrance cannot be forced"). Rhythm modulates calmly, matching placid pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful repetition (tides, diffuse) taught early pays off without loops. Minor figurative density in ritual beat coherent, no muddle at closure ("dawn through fog").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai ritual, lace/compass, apology color transforms regret trope; risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
