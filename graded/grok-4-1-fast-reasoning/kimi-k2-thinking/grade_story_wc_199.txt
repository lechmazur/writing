<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in orderly traits drives prophecy fulfillment, with actions like building monuments aligning perfectly; lacks deeper interior contradiction or flawed impulses acting simultaneously to elevate beyond strong execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (dust→map→First Seed prod), yielding Charged Poise closure in arbor's bloom with legible conceptual cost of merging timelines; orientation anchors early in arbor hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor and bark hollow constrain climbs and seed placements, charging final glowing image; sensory details (pulsing dust, humming seeds) selectively mirror Lira's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding prophecy tightens accumulatively through dust transformation and leaf map to First Seed awakening, with agency in prodding and sprinkling; cost felt in honoring forgotten voices foreclosing stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory renewal emerges organically from monument-building and leaf messages, resonating in silver leaf rain without moralizing; final image reweights past/future merger non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward glowing seeds and mossy patterns; purposeful repetition teaches poetic texture, modulating rhythm without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density in image-propelled lines with varied rhythm, but patterned repetition ("mossy delight," "transformed always") creates minor template cadence in mid-beats, docking propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed memories and moonstone prophecy transforms folklore tropes into inevitable bloom; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
