<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied thaw peaks in "she wept as the names circled her," earning shift from shame to purpose; contradictory shame/purpose impulses act via reconfiguration choice. Minor label-speak in "technically gentle" repetitions feels unearned but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: card discovery accumulates to rope reconfiguration to sound illumination as RR closure with emotional cost legible in thawed heart and glowing rope constellation. No orientation debt; single scene causality tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora and ice constrain fingers ("chilled, never faltered") and charge final image (rope as "constellation of braids"); sensory hierarchy (vibrating air, pulsing light) mirrors caster's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, deepens via illumination reversal that forecloses shame path; agency in threading braids narrows options under accumulative lens, cost felt in "ice that had sealed her heart."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of absence defining form emerges via wax/bell to perforations/braids; final "names would live" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing, though ending callbacks risk slight redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (pattern-noticing: "grid matched... perfectly") with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Loops in "technically gentle" (x3) and "snowmelt ardor" (x3) plus paraphrase churn in final third ("thawed... river carving... perfectly, thawed") dull propulsion and obscure closure image density; artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Punched card-rope synthesis transforms preservation trope into sound-casting ingenuity; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via absence-to-form arc.</comment>
