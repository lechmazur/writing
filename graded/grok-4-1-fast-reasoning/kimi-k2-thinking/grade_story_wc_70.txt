<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodiment of involuntary truth as curse compels riddle answer, driving key choice to open box; interiority concrete via booth solitude and climbing resolve. Minor unearned epiphany slip in final reflection on wonder, but doesn't touch closure choice. Traits complicate routine without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of storm memory to honeycomb activation builds density to CR closure where light flows with felt cost of her climb and truth-spill. Orientation anchored early in tollgate post-blackout. Riddle-to-activation linkage tightens options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's copper receptors and gearwork constrain choices, charging final plate placement; bio-electric flowers and drone shafts filter through Mara's tollkeeper bias. Recurrent amber/honeyed dusk evolves causally with activation glow. Sensory hierarchy sharpens via professional gaze on static discharge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grid restoration via wonder tightens accumulatively when truth-answer yields honeycomb, narrowing to tower climb with rust-scraped cost. Agency in micro-choice to repeat riddle crystallizes stance. Coherent pressure without reversal overload fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wonder-as-current theme emerges organically from riddle/memory to final buzz resumption, reweighting drone failure premise via particulars. Resonant CR in "darkness tastes like honey" without moralizing. Note's phrasing borders statement but anchors in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (honey/lightning synesthesia) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from humming spires to golden cascade. Minimal dialogue natural, child's voice distinct. Diction controlled, eliding exposition purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful honey/lightning motifs; rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("dead stars," "nectar dusk") during activation but pattern-taught, not obscuring closure image. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truthful keeper, lightning-honeycomb, wonder-failing drones transforms tropes organically; risk in riddle mechanics heightens stakes to CR payoff. Premise follows implications to city hum without retreat.</comment>
