<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacifist history culminates in shadow integration, where allowing hate ("wish that others had suffered more") contradicts mercy trait, earning selfless release of Sera with personal forfeiture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through grief-threads to shimmering seam and portal; closure as RR (Mira's ascension seals door) lands with ship's groan as legible cost in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tear-shimmered photographs as recurring micro-setting constrain stitching action, evolve via release into light, and mirror internal integration to charge portal glimpse and grass image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to save Sera via non-violent opening tightens accumulatively as shadow work forecloses force path, with agency in integration yielding self-sacrifice cost amid hull strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-shadow emerges implicitly via hate allowance to forgiveness, answered non-literally in child's laugh reweighting violence-failure as origin without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (dimensional memory in tears) modulates rhythmically to compression at breach ("blazed hot... in recognition"), sustaining single POV coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in lines like "weave her consciousness through the photographs" propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies to peak propulsion in stitching beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tear-dimensional weaving and joy-gravity synthesize sci-fi mercy origin boldly, transforming portal trope via pacifist shadow work into inevitable, risk-heightened CR.</comment>
