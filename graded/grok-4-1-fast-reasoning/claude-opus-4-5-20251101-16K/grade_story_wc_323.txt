<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied tears and breath catching at stars reveal contradictory reverence for old/new navigation; anchor link micro-choices earn final integration with felt cost of cultural loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds to CR closure in anchor-toward-horizon image, reweighting old/new navigation with conceptual cost of continuity; orientation anchored in opening paragraph, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic spires and cold anchor constrain ascent choice and charge final image; starlight on corroded surface mirrors internal expansion purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation) deepens at sighting with agency in tracing patterns, foreclosing pure-traditional path under accumulative lens; cost legible in overwhelmed tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final anchor gesture resonates as non-literal answer to old/modern tension, emerging from particulars without moralizing; reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with navigation-biased noticing (Orion, Mars tracing); rhythmic modulation builds somber intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in starlit beats with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops, purposeful lyricism reads aloud seamlessly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken-city star epiphany transforms first-contact trope through lived anchor memory; fresh synthesis of folded/unfolded nav feels inevitable.</comment>
