<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in exile and past witnessing of Valdris's mortality compels patient messaging; interiority concrete via ink rationing and purposeful shuffling. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene, relying on summary of prior efforts. Final endurance (letting go) earned by seeded truth's fulfillment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: message density builds pattern across books/years to cadence shift in library's dissolution (CR). Orientation anchored poetically by ~50 words (Mira in temple library between heartbeats). Closure cost legible in "Mira... let go" as purpose ends her existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust like incense, pressure of shifting constellations) constrain choices (rationed ink) and charge final image (shelves sigh, library dissolves). Micro-setting (drifting books) guides tactics organically. POV bias filters cosmic scale through diminutive exile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via nearing completion ("work nearly complete") and constellation shift narrowing to collapse. Agency in final message and rune-tracing forecloses exile with existential cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked magnitude toppling false divinity emerges implicitly from ink-seeded truths and patient drift; final image ("toppled a false god with ink and patience") reweights small acts without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (cosmic grandeur in child-sized figure, e.g., "held cosmic foundations in her palms"). Rhythmic prose modulates elegantly to pressure (short sentences in collapse). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rune of drift... river learning to fly" advances action and world); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent and sparse in peak (tremble/release). Propulsion peaks in collapse sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diminutive titan seeding temporal drifts to sunder empire transforms exile trope organically. Risky cosmic scale in quiet library scene heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from ink-to-collapse arc. No derivative echoes.</comment>
