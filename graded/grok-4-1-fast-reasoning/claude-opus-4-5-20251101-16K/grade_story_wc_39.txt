<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with past flaws (drunk, bridge-burner) anchoring her patient ritual choices; visitor forces micro-choice affirming motivation. Minor epiphanic summary in "gleaned redemption" reflection tilts toward tidy arc without full embodied contradiction in peak girl moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to visitor tightening and CR closure in final writing image reweighting isolation as privilege with felt marginal cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards or transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (sand sifting, gull cries, dawn light through jars) selectively filter via Maren's ear/voice bias, constraining ritual in buried loft; music box/jars as micro-setting charge final harmonizing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve voices vs. mortality) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via visitor's grandmother jar narrowing to generational endurance; cost legible in Maren's wasted past and ongoing vagrancy felt at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid loss emerges organically from jar ritual and visitor to final image reconfiguration (loss into beauty), resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; music box reprise recharges wistful ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (sounds as voices, sand breathing) stable in third-limited POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (girl's offering, Maren's promise) advances stakes with distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences amid lyric flow); minor paraphrase loops in ritual descriptions (e.g., "sweeten" repeats purposeful under textural lens) but no closure dulling or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jar preservation transforms redemption trope via dune-bound ritual; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens wistful tone without gimmick, inevitable in final charged image.</comment>
