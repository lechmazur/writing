<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to learn building language intensifies through returns and seal confrontation, earning final nod; Mrs. Aldrich's pride in reveal reveals traits under pressure. Contradictory impulses (interrogate vs. sustain ritual) act in bringing seal. Minor tell in "mourn them before they fall" does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds ritual density to seal reveal tightening, culminating in CR where nod reconfigures reality as "borrowed time" pocket with conceptual cost of forgetting. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Shard transitions legible via weekly pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower constrain final lesson, charging closure image of falling light paralleling dying memories. Sensory details (lavender, ink, scars) filtered through architect's bias. Seal as micro-setting handled tactilely in reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve building language via belief) signaled early, deepens at seal confrontation narrowing to trade-off reality for sacred lie. Agency in bringing seal and nodding forecloses normalcy with felt cost in "stubbornness and longing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through lies emerges organically from sugar to historian to death denial, reweighted non-literally in final "sacred" agreement and Sumerian threshold. Final image answers without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature fixates on scars/stains, stable through ghostly reveal; dialogue subtextual ("agreed upon lie"). Rhythmic control modulates from ritual calm to charged acceptance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or muddle; metaphors coherent (sky "unraveled," pocket "stitched"). Rhythm varies, propelling to "meteors kept falling, ancient light" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghostly tutor of building languages transforms trope via "agreed lies" and memory scars; Sumerian word feels inevitable, risking supernatural logic paid in belief's cost.</comment>
