<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's blithe patience drives decoding choices, embodied in "cemetery-roughened fingers" tracing sightlines, earning shift to "new weight" without unearned epiphany; contradictory lightness amid graves shown in opening, compelling higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure: final mapping reconfigures dead as speakers with conceptual cost of endless game; orientation anchored early (October evening, Aldrich plot), one tightening at decoded message "Discover the shape of hidden intentions."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and tapestry constrain decoding, stars charge final image of mapping "thread by tender thread"; sensory selective (velveteen gloom, flaking paint), POV-biased via gardener's eye for patterns in soil/threads.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden truths) signaled via case, escalates accumulatively through decoding to mapping under lens; agency in patient untangling forecloses blithe isolation with cost of "game of excavation...against time itself."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient echoes emerges from thread-gazes-marigolds particulars, final starlit mapping offers resonant CR reweighting dead's silence without moralizing; subtext in gazes "turned toward something—a point outside the frame."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (joy in graves, patterns in frayed threads); rhythmic texture modulates from humming lightness to "vast blue quiet," purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figures like "velveteen gloom" integrate without muddle, propel via "letter by painstaking letter" in peak decoding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess/tapestry cipher transforms treasure trope into generational echoes; risk of accumulative decoding pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, tapestry gazes non-obvious pivot.</comment>
