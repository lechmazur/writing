<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Solid interiority via harmonic resonance and phantom limb ache grounds the skimmer's reverent endurance; realization of keeper role earns stasis with binding cost. Contradictory impulses subtle (wander vs. preserve), not sharply simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bird patterns accumulate to arrowhead resonance, culminating in CR via "peace in stillness" reconfiguration with eternal binding cost legible in final hum. Orientation anchored early; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust constrain disturbance, charging closure naming; canyon echoes mirror resonance payoff. Sensory hierarchy (harmonic touch over visual) selective via skimmer POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate without moving) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bird appraisal to purpose realization foreclosing mobility; cost of sacred desecration risk felt throughout. Minor abstractness in peak pressure before arrowhead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of purposeful stillness emerges organically from arrowhead's sacred kill reweighting wandering pulse; birds' question "Is there peace in stillness?" answered non-literally in resonant naming. Final image recharges particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (resonance/hum filters all notice) stable in single POV; rhythmic prose modulates from patient observation to resolute hum. No dialogue; elision of motion purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("towers of bone rose like forgotten prayers") risks overwrite in opener but integrates without muddling closure. No loops; read-aloud cadence strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bound spirit navigating via bird resonance and arrowhead appraisal transforms stillness trope; risk of lyric stasis pays off in charged poise, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
