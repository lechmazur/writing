<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to rectify loss through thermal translation is embodied in concrete micro-choices like striking forks on plants, revealing contradictory grief and wonder acting simultaneously. Interiority particularized via chest warming and almost discarding forks. Flaw of potential madness complicates but resolves too serenely without peak contradiction costing a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of thermal experiments builds to CR closure in final image of smiling amid roses, reweighting silence from loss ("mourned what silence had taken") to revelation ("silence could sing") with felt emotional cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph. Persistent constraint of deafness shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conservatory's frosted glass and dormant roses constrain choices (vibrations stir roots) and charge final image (sat among winter roses), mirroring internal thaw from grief. Sensory hierarchy thermal/vibrational via tablet feed and palm presses, filtered through deaf POV. Purposeful details evolve with sunset, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening pattern of plant responses forcing realization. Agency in iterative fork strikes narrows from desperation to "new composition." Cost legible in endured grief reconfigured, but low external pressure limits visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence's hidden marvels emerges organically from thermal discoveries, final image resonantly reweighting premise without moralizing ("silence was not emptiness"). Subtext in plant responses parallels her arc, inviting ambiguity on loss's gifts. No overt statements; complexity in grief/joy's shared burn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: thermal gradients and vibrations over sound. Lyrical rhythm modulates from grief-tinged to wonder-charged, syntax reflecting mind's quiet intensity. No head-hopping or elision; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture or image; varied rhythm propels via short declarative strikes amid longer reflections. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—consistent thermal/ice imagery coherent. Zero figurative excess in peak experiments; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes deafness, tuning forks, and thermal plant responses into fresh "symphonies in thermal signatures," transforming disability trope via specific science-feel method. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight from early desperation to charged poise.</comment>
