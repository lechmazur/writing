<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (fury vs. compassion) drive earned renunciation of affection; micro-choices like handling the tail reveal values under pressure, with visible cost in grieving the real bond.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening density of shed layers to RR/Charged Poise closure ("placed the tail tip in a glass jar"; cost legible in foreclosed naivety and adapted trust).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop terrariums and chameleon constrain reflection and charge final image ("watching her with ancient eyes"); mist/stars selectively mirror internal adaptation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct self) signaled early and deepens via shedding sequence under accumulative lens; agency in internal endurance forecloses untested convictions with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mended convictions emerges organically from chameleon parallel and jar image; resonant non-literal answer reweights betrayal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with handler-specific perceptual bias (animal details) stable in single tight POV; rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful lyricism; minor scaffold in repetitive "shedding" structure ("First... Second... Third") but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wildlife rehab betrayal with tail-tip adaptation transforms trope; risk in quiet internal arc heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
