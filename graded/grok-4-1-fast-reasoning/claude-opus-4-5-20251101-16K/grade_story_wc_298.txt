<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interior conflict between guilt and resolve culminates in the earned trade at "I'm trading for it," revealing contradictory impulses through action; Vesna applies sharp pressure. Minor diagnostic labels like "reckless idealist" slightly abstract embodiment in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from confrontation to tree-stirred trade; on-page DC closure via card's transformation carries legible cost of her future. Orientation anchored immediately in catacomb descent; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots and bones constrain the trade, charging the climax as Mira presses the card to bark; sensory details like "bone shadows into lace" filter through urgency. Environment evolves causally with stirring roots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via Vesna's revelation and Mira's counter-offer, narrowing options with agency-driven reversal; cost of consumed future viscerally felt in burning sensation. Escalation coheres under causal lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tarot card's shift from single feet to two figures walking together offers resonant answer to sacrifice theme, reweighting wreckage into shared purpose without statement. Emerges organically from trade's alchemy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in "patterns they leave behind"; dialogue carries subtext like Vesna's laugh echoing stakes. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in trade beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "bark rippling around carved angels"; no loops, varied rhythm propels to dawn image. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrites but serves accumulative tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard premise synthesizes death/persistence freshly, with tree-mediated trade as non-obvious turn growing from rules; risk in alchemized destiny heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
