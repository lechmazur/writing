<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to create beauty from ruins, rooted in tasting her mother's forgetting and grandmother's seed, compels her pruning micro-choices with embodied contradiction (not revenge). Interiority particular via chef senses; endurance earned as rebellion forecloses forgetting with personal cost. Final basket-tucking crystallizes hierarchy of values untarnished.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pruning density builds to alignment ripening as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring rebellion with unrepeatable cost ("alignment ending, unrepeatable in her lifetime"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality tightens via moons' convergence. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in final greenhouse creak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse, shears, and cracked glass constrain pruning and channel alignment light, charging final creak-as-friend image. Sensory hierarchy chef-POV (earth/decay/hope); details evolve causally (fruit swells). Micro-setting mirrors ruins-to-beauty without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest potent fruit for memory rebellion) signaled early, tightens via pruning under converging moons' pressure, narrowing to ripened twelve. Agency in cuts forecloses fragmentation; felt cost in singular alignment. Minor abstractness in world stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-beauty emerges via particulars (seed taste, synaptic fruit, kitchen plans); final "harvest would take root in minds" reweights ruins non-literally. Subtext in gentle cuts vs. bombs; no moralizing, ambiguity in world's readiness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with chef-perceptual signature (taste/scent biases); diction/rhythm modulate from deliberate snips to swelling gold. Compression purposeful, no elision; texture distinct without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "Snip. A wayward branch fell."); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, specific verbs/nouns. Elevated diction fits lyrical voice; peak alignment beat muddle-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-tasting chef pruning synaptic fruit under alignment transforms dystopian forgetfulness into kitchen rebellion. Non-obvious angle on resistance; risk in quiet poise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
