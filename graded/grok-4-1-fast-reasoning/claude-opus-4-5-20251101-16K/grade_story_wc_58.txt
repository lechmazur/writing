<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority rooted in particular traits like mapping grief through textures; contradictory impulses emerge in reclaiming Isaveth's absences via writing, earning the endurance to stay through winter with felt isolation cost. Winding the gold thread embodies motivation without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from afternoon visit to evening writing; CR closure reweights absences as deliberate choices via final image of pen scratching amid rising shadows, with undeniable conceptual cost of flourishing in ruins. Orientation anchors crisply in opening lines; one tightening via Isaveth's revelations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden constrains choices by suiting solitary work and mirrors internal states through ivy-choked ruins where wildflowers sprout; recurring shadows pool like dark water, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (decaying leaves, owl call) reflects Maren's priorities without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping healing tightens texturally via density of Isaveth's explained absences, narrowing to realization that forecloses restoration fantasy; cost legible in commitment to winter isolation. Agency in listening and writing drives deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (geography metaphors) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from reflective to charged poise at "pen scratching softly," heightening pressure without elision issues. Prose as character reflects Maren's cartographic mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; rhythm varies naturally, metaphors cohere in weaving/mapping pattern without muddle, propelling to closure. "Shadows pooling beneath the hedges like dark water rising" exemplifies propulsion and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-mapping via living obituaries transforms death tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes, with thread's reprise feeling inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
