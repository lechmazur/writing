<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—silence as death vs. vessel—act in discovery beat; final letter-writing renunciation earned by prior refusal to leave and nerve sensations, with cost in "remaining is enough."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens via staircase discovery to CR where silence reconfigures as filled vessel; cost legible in "snow accumulating on a roof until the structure groaned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusty spiral staircase discoloration constrains inciting discovery; recurring cobalt walls and snow charge final restorative hum, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Internal stake (cost of safety) deepens via notes' discovery under accumulative lens, forcing agency in letter addition that crystallizes endurance with emotional cost in foreclosed singing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bolt and letters yield emergent theme of silence-as-scream; final image of "silence slowly transforming...become song" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nerve-tingling perceptual signature biases sensory hierarchy; rhythmic prose (e.g., "seraphically mundane") modulates to charged closure poise, stable third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "Frostbitten hope—that was what she felt, examining that cold brass bolt" propels without figurative muddle, varying rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence transformed via hidden compartment chain into vessel of memory; bolt's irreplaceable specificity risks lyric reflection for fresh refugee ingenuity.</comment>
