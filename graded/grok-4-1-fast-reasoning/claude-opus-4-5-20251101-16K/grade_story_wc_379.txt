<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to listen and witness is concrete and intensifies through courtyard fragments to the key placement, earning her endurance; interiority particular but occasionally summarizes conflict rather than embodying it simultaneously, as in "she trusted the stories that surfaced."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build density to the bolt cutters' "metallic sigh," landing CR closure in the mailed letters and Oaxaca image with conceptual cost of demolition vs. witness; orientation anchored early in courtyard; one tightening via intrusion suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard's terra-cotta pots and jasmine constrain gatherings and charge final photo contrast; sensory hierarchy (dawn gold on jasmine) reflects Maren's priorities; spatial choreography clear across sessions to mailbox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing Vasquez's story tightens accumulatively via intrusion notice to collective opening, narrowing options with demolition clock; cost legible in foreclosed courtyard but earned witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing emerges organically from sediment-like stories to locket/photo reprise, offering resonant CR without moralizing; final key beside courtyard photo reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV on Maren with perceptual signature in "discernment... what you chose to hear"; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythmic control modulates from calm accumulation to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("stories accumulated like sediment" motif); no loops, scaffold, or muddled figures; minor lyrical elevation fits voice without obscuring mailbox climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift curation as metaphor for communal witness transforms locked-mailbox trope; locket reveal and Oaxaca payoff feel inevitable from courtyard pattern.</comment>
