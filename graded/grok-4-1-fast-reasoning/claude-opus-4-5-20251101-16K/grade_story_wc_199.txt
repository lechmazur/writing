<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preservation and release act in the revelation beat; final renunciation of hoarding self earned via prior monument-building causality, embodied in "tears tracking through the ash on her cheeks."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density yields CR in glowing veins and message; on-page cost legible in crystallized purpose shift at "She would build monuments to her old self."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor and falling leaves constrain decoding method and charge final planting image; "grey sky seemed less like an ending now and more like a held breath before rain" reconfigures via environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Speck discovery and message deepen stake from decoding to arbor's death-by-preservation; protagonist agency in prodding and monument forces trade-off renunciation with cost in emotional release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endings seeding beginnings emerges implicitly via leaf-monument arc; final "endless conversation between what was and what would be" reweights hoarding premise non-literally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propulsion in revelation ("veins illuminated like rivers of molten gold"); zero loops or scaffolds, varied rhythm sustains momentum to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating islands with leaf-folklore and moon-tear speck synthesize fresh lyric fantasy; risk-taking in textural revelation heightens renewal stakes organically.</comment>
