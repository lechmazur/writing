<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's uncertainty as borrowed "garment too large" creates contradictory impulses—trembling hands vs. plunging into basin—that compel key choices under rising acid pressure, earning her shift to "keeper of beautiful brokenness" with master's felt absence as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory fragments layer density across keys, tightening to CR closure in glowing gold veins; cost legible in "acid sea would eventually claim everything" reweighting survival premise without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass floor view of churning acid and brass pontoons constrain breath-held ritual, charging final image of gears vs. tide; sensory narrowing under crisis (lungs burn) reflects alchemist bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (narrate for meaning) signaled early, escalates via lung-burning tightening that forces key micro-choices narrowing options; agency in pockmark matching pays cost in master's presence, reweighting oblivion under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from sensation-quilting to gold veins, offering resonant non-literal answer—"nothing was truly forgotten"—that reweights brokenness without moralizing; master's whisper integrates arc inextricable from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalizes alchemist perceptual signature (pockmarks as "language," sensations over images); rhythmic modulation peaks in underwater compression, with purposeful kintsugi diction taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short gasps amid layered memories); no loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors like "quilted fragments" integrate without muddle in peak basin beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid-sea workshop and pockmark-memory synthesis transforms post-apocalyptic survival trope via kintsugi alchemy; bold ritual risk heightens stakes, with statue's gold reprise feeling inevitable hindsight.</comment>
