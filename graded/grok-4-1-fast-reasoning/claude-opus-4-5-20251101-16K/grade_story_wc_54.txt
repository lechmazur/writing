<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation roots deeply in curiosity, intensifying via the sextant discovery to compel her proposal shift; interiority concrete and embodied ("something shift in her chest"). Micro-choices like mapping reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: internal conflict more reflective than simultaneous impulses in pivotal proposal beat, but change earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries accumulate to reconfigure demolition stake into revival CR. Orientation anchored early ("Maya pressed her palm against the cold duraglass"). Closure on-page ("She submitted her alternative proposal") with conceptual cost in "realistic dreams" accounting for loss; persistent constraint (tangled systems) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective via engineering POV ("water reclamation systems crossed ventilation shafts at impossible angles"); constrains choices (surviving water system enables turbine). Charges closure ("emergency lights had steadied"); spatial choreography coherent through corridors to window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (demolition vs. waystation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sextant/mapping to proposal agency foreclosing full revival. Cost legible ("couldn't fix everything... just one"); pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of realistic hope emerges from maze/discoveries, resonant in final CR image ("navigation... choosing a direction anyway") reweighting prior chaos without statement. Particulars (Chen's flows, sextant) drive arc organically; ambiguity lingers in desert indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with engineering perceptual signature ("schematic looked like abstract art"); rhythmic control modulates from survey calm to dawn resolve. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("Dust motes drifted..."); no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor figurative density in descriptions purposeful, not overwriting; propulsion clear in discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh sci-fi synthesis: brass sextant talisman unlocks sustainable revival in ruined terminal, transforming abandonment trope via "mathematics of realistic dreams." Risk in quiet CR pays off; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
