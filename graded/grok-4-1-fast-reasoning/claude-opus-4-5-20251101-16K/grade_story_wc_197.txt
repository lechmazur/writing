<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority in embodied actions like kneeling to evade drone and gripping key, revealing resourcefulness under pressure; final distribution earns change from overlooked to recognized leader. Minor slip in labeled epiphany ("She understood then... underestimated herself") borders unearned insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from alley evasion to lagoon cache; puddle reflection tightens path as one meaningful deepening. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in distributing drives with ripple image making ongoing erasure cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and shattered booth constrain retrieval and meeting, charging final mirrored sky/memory image; puddle reflections as micro-setting guide choice selectively through Mira's bias. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency (drone hum narrows to water's gold).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving truth amid unraveling signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puddle directive narrowing options under patrol threat; survivors' emergence forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in shadowed departure foreclosing easy safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges organically from cache contents (erased protests, unmurdered atrocities) and final ripple handing truths into night; resonant non-literal answer reweights overlooked power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in ephemera codes (dusk water, starlit gold); voice modulates rhythmically from tense evasion to poised distribution. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("We thought you were dead") with subtext of respect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "amber light bled across the city's wet streets" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor paraphrase loop in "overlooked/underestimated" repetition purposeful but borders redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Puddle maps and Pacific Bell key transform dystopian tropes into fresh, grounded ingenuity; auric lagoon synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric codes that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
