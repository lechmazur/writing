<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vereth's motivation rooted in aesthetic conviction compels the central act of paraphrasing with embodied tremor of certainty upon touching the column; contradictory impulses (council fears vs. her thresholds view) act in scene; final liberation earned by prior causality with conceptual cost of dissolved boundaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hum to glow to thawing ice; closure as Charged Poise RR in warm quartz and thawing crack reconfigures boundaries with implied cost of unleashed forces; orientation anchored early in atrium return post-ban.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choices (palm on column triggers response, windows frame expectant shapes); final thaw charges image; sensory hierarchy (bone-hum, luminous ice) reflects poet's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of linguistic liberation signaled early tightens via accumulative deepening (paraphrase causes hum/glow/cracks); agency in speaking forecloses sacred purity path; cost legible in world's expectant response under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as invitations emerges organically from paraphrased verse "door...meant to be walked through" and thawing lake; resonant non-literal answer reweights sacred/common divide without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (transience shapes, fleeting shapes); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to pulse; diction controlled in poet's idiom, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (hum intensifies via action); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (membranes/thresholds); no loops, scaffold, or overwriting in peak paraphrase beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic fantasy where aesthetic act thaws literal world; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive transforms sacred-text trope; inevitable hindsight from poet's core conviction.</comment>
