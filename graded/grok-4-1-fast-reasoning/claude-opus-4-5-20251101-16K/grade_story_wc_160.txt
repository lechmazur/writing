<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via machinist-specific readings of schematics and adhesive; trembling hands embody dawning realization without labels. Internal conflict between guild logic and heritage earned through discoveries. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "encrypted compassion" feels slightly diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure or closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from envelope analysis to auxiliary channel discovery, yielding Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "Six months of work, maybe more," foreclosing quick fix. Orientation anchored early in caldera amphitheater; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breathing motif as recurring micro-setting constrains via compromising foundation and charges final pat/exhale image. Sensory hierarchy (rhythm over sight) filters through machinist POV. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates beyond postcard volcano.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. heritage) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hesitation marks to channel find. Agency in drafting narrows options; felt cost in rebuild effort charges poise. Coherent pressure without reversal overload fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of precision as love emerges from schematics/margins, reweighted in chain's "fifty-three links" reprise without statement. Final whisper/image answers via resonance, not moral. Complexity in silent legacies lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third with machinist perceptual signature (structures' "language," adhesive residue). Rhythmic diction modulates from observation to resolve; purposeful compression in discoveries legible. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; "breathing" motif varies purposefully without loop. Minor repetition in exhale images controlled. Propulsion clear, rhythm supports accumulative build to chiming chain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering as encrypted love transforms legacy trope. Risky reflective mode pays via adhesive insight and chain reprise. Non-obvious "water finds a way" harmonizes stakes organically.</comment>
