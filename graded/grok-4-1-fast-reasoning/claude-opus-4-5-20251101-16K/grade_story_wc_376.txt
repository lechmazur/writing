<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's wilting leaves embody contradictory fear and resolve, driving micro-choices like speaking truth at the door; final mapping renunciation of hiding earns closure with visible cost in carried plate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shredded papers build to Repository CR where mother's words reconfigure lost conversations with emotional cost; orientation anchors early in studio post-oasis; shards transition legibly without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Toxic sky and domes constrain survival and search, mirroring internal wilt/bloom; crystalline containers charge closure image of green-glow transcript, filtering through Mira's gold-veined perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering mother's truth tightens accumulatively via map-piecing to door-truth test, forcing endurance with wilt-cost; agency in honesty forecloses hiding path, legible in unfurling leaves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Candor preservation emerges implicitly from failed merchant lie to attendant observation, culminating in non-literal mother's transcript repricing curse as proof; resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (leaf-sensing bias) modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You wilt near dishonesty"); no head-hopping, diction poetic yet grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short wilt beats to expansive Repository); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (ferns from frost) integrate without muddle in peak transcript reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lie-detecting flora and sound-archives transforms preservation trope; risk in elliptical shards heightens purpose-shimmer closure without gimmick.</comment>
