<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climb despite phobias, earning the final escape with relational cost; Victor's mask crack reveals his desperation under pressure. Interiority embodied via trembling hands and hammering heart. Final choice renunciation of him as father feels causal from prior training betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: file discovery → library hideout → Victor arrival → proof reveal → escape DC with cost (foreclosed "home" with Victor). Orientation anchored early (rusted library, three days post-file). Single scene tightens via confrontation; closure Charged Poise in rooftop run reconfigures life options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted ladder groans constrain climb choice, flaking rust heightens phobia pressure; starlight enables note decryption on cast. Sensory narrowed to crunching footsteps, shallow breath under crisis. Setting mirrors collapse of false life via collapsed shelves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity vs. Victor's control) signaled early, tightens causally via proof reveal narrowing his manipulation options. Agency in showing cast and climbing forecloses trust path with emotional cost. Escalation driven by her dialogue forcing his desperation lunge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal reweights via "fears that walk and climb," emerging organically; final image "I'm coming home" resonates non-literally as vulnerability-to-power shift without moral state. Subtext in seashell whispers charges maternal pull. Complexity in near-belief of his warmth lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual phobia bias (heights scream); voice rhythmic, modulates short sentences in climb stress. Dialogue subtextual—Victor's "you needed me" pursues control, her repeat "I'm scared" evades then strikes. Distinct idioms: her embodied fear vs. his calm mentor warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "rust flaking beneath her grip" advances action/embodies fear). Varied rhythm accelerates in climb, no loops/artifacts; specific verbs/nouns propel. Minor syntactic similarity in fear reps but voice-motivated, not template.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt phobias enable outwitting sentimental kidnapper via library climb; vulnerability-power arc transforms trope betrayal organically. Risky emotional/physical convergence at ladder peak heightens stakes. No template echoes; seashell/cast particulars irreplaceable.</comment>
