<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—aloof observation vs. entering the cave—and final release/renunciation earned by lifelong promise with visible emotional cost in the shell placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from quay reflections to cave chamber; CR closure lands on-page in blue-glow realization and shell alcove, reweighting premise with felt cost of time running out; orientation anchored early, wrong turn micro-reversal pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave's rippling light and basin constrain placement choice and charge final image; sensory details (blue light, sea-lavender) selective through painter's perceptual bias, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise) signaled early, tightens via wrong turn deepening options into personal discovery; agency in shell placement forecloses distant painting with legible release cost charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from shell, cave tides, and realization; final image offers non-literal resonant answer—proof in spaces between forgetting—reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (painterly noticing of light, stone); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to charged poise at closure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops on "temporary eternity" (-0.4) purposeful for accumulative texture but slightly scaffold-like without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painter entering his painted world via wrong turn; risk-taking in lyric CR closure heightens thematic stakes, transforming nostalgia trope through cave's hidden logic.</comment>
