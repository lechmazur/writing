<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hide damage vs. share scars) act in reflection, culminating in earned decision to tell Lila about Solomons; interiority concrete and embodied, with daughter's notes forcing micro-choice to trace scars together.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of reflections and image accumulation to RR closure ("knot...begin to loosen"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; discovery of notes provides one decisive tightening with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight constrain waiting reflection and mirror internal softening (mist thickens as dusk deepens); brain coral as micro-setting charges final image, filtering through Maya's biased sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shared anxieties signaled early tightens accumulatively at notes discovery, narrowing protective isolation to bridge-building renunciation; agency in holding cast forces stance crystallization with emotional cost legible in chest ache loosening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting meaning from wounds emerges organically from particulars (coral, notes, weaving women); final embrace reconfigures anxieties as bridge without moralizing, reweighting premise with resonant counter-reading of inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "twilight seeped...like an old bruise") biases toward war-touched textures; stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels to charged closure image ("held each other as twilight gave way to dark"); metaphors coherent and purposeful, no overwriting in peak discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cast notes as discovery device transforms anxiety inheritance trope into fresh, grounded revelation; Solomons backstory synthesis with playground fall creates inevitable hindsight reconfiguration without hedging.</comment>
