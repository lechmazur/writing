<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between suppressed artistry and compulsion is embodied in stained fingers and bone-deep ache; contradictory impulses surface simultaneously in cave reflections on her accounting years versus childhood memories. Final renunciation of suppression earned via grandmother's note, with felt cost of prior hollowing. Micro-choices like using sketching knife reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: revelations (painting, lockbox, note) densify pattern to Charged Poise closure where Mira tucks journal and embraces legacy, reconfiguring suppression with conceptual cost of "hollowing" legible in "auroral sorrow washes through her." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. One tightening via broken lock improv forces deeper engagement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean cave's bioluminescent glow and crystals constrain navigation by memory alone and charge final image, refracting "prismatic whispers" as creativity uncorks. Sensory details (cold stone, mineral dust) filter through artist's eye, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (alcove, hollow) guides discovery purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace calling vs. bury it) signaled early via stained fingers/pull; accumulative deepening via note reweights with personal cost of grandmother's regret, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in prying lock alters tactics; visible price in deferred dreams settling "comfortably into her bones." Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable creativity emerges organically from hid works, rejection letters, and note's warning, answered resonantly in final climb where "sorrow transforming slowly into light" reweights prior suppression without moralizing. Subtext in shadows "alive" and fragile memories invites ambiguity on practicality's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (artist traces seams, sees shadows alive); diction/rhythm modulates from crystalline silence to prismatic whispers, heightening dawning hope. No dialogue; voice particular via mnemonic precision and embodied artist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm (short for surrender of lid, longer for note); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—auroral hues purposeful and consistent. Zero artifacts dull closure image of "charcoal still darkening her fingertips."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inheritance trope via cave-secreted art and mnemonic gift enabling improv; risk in lyric cave ascent transforms grief into light without gimmick. Transformation test passes: swap cave for attic and logic frays.</comment>
