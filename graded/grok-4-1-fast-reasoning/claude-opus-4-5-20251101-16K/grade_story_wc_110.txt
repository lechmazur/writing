<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maeve's motivation to surrender for peace then reveal truth shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning the hand-clasp choice with relational cost. Interiority concrete via lens-handling and economical speech from night shifts. Minor therapy-speak in "thaw mistrust" but embodied in doodle summons and confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (water, lens, doodles) tightening to Charged Poise closure in hand-clasp and sun-scattered lens with years-lost cost legible in "drop by drop." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene causality links eavesdrop → doodle → mutual drawings → reconciliation without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains via ripples from steps mirroring thaw; water/light recur to charge final lens image. Sensory selective (trickle percussion, grey light) through Maeve's bias. No white-room; lived-in via post-shift vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) signaled early via doodle, deepens accumulatively through mutual drawings narrowing to hand-clasp agency foreclosing war-path. Cost felt in "three years of ice" reweighted at end. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing emerges via doodles/lens/silence without statement; final image reconfigures "war" to promise. Subtext in unvoiced "stay." Complexity in surrender's cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (truth "ambiguously clear"); dialogue subtextual ("I let you be wrong") advances goal. Stable limited POV; rhythm modulates to resonant hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with metaphors woven (forecourt "breathes") supporting lyric accumulation; rhythm varies without loops. Minor figurative density in opening but purposeful for hush payoff. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doodle cipher/private language thawing rift; lens reprise transforms seeing/understanding trope. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
