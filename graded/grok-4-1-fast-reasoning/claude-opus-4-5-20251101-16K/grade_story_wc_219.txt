<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's luminous skeptic trait drives her initial chemical focus, contradicted by embodied warmth of fly amber in final descent, earning worldview shift. Contradictory impulses act in scene via dialogue admission that data "explained nothing." Astronaut and child apply relational pressure without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footprints and arrivals build density to CR closure in Vera's realization—"the need comes first"—with conceptual cost of Visitors' aloneness legible in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tower climb, Institute). Single scene with earned convergence; no shard excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown sculpture path and rainwashed tower constrain climb and view choices, charging convergence image. Sensory hierarchy (bronze quiet, weeds threading stone) filters via Vera's xenobiologist bias. Fly amber as micro-setting recharges Oligocene forests in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemistry of homecoming) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shared insights and child's "more are coming," narrowing to renunciation of data for ache. Cost felt in worldview trade-off, legible in "we produce oxytocin because returning matters."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming ache emerges organically from convergence and fly amber's yearning image, reweighting Visitors' gift in final lines without statement. Resonant CR contrasts human turning back vs. alien forward travel, with counter-reading (tragic beauty) lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (skeptical measurements yielding to beauty). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("studying homecoming," not asking); voice rhythm modulates from analytical to charged poise. No head-hopping despite four characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short child lines vs. reflective blocks). Minor figurative density ("bronze quiet" reprise purposeful); no loops, but "converging" echoes tighten texture without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: first-contact trope transformed via human attachment vs. Visitor detachment, fly amber as irreplaceable yearning symbol. Quiet CR ending risks bold inconclusiveness, heightening stakes through convergence pattern (+0.3).</comment>
