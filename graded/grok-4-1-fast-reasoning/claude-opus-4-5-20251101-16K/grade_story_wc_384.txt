<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of calibrated treason—saving some by sacrificing others—act in backstory anchored to present quest, earning the final unlinking with embodied chest-weight lift; flaws complicate without hedging. Keeper as secondary pressures via ritual guidance. Minor reflective summary of treason math slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/drips builds to CR closure where key/thorn dissolve, unlinking names with legible internal cost ("mechanism was internal"); orientation anchored by ~50 words at threshold. One tightening via altar press suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora beam on altar constrains ritual choice, charging final dissolution image; sensory hierarchy (light play, drip music) reflects Yara's patient enduring under timeless pressure. Details tactile via key press, pools of tears mirroring guilt. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgive unfinished) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to internal lock revelation, narrowing to heart's release with felt cost (decades' weight lifted); agency in placing objects forecloses guilt-path. Keeper dialogue forces stance crystallization. One deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-unlinking emerges organically from key/thorn dissolution reweighting treason's math; final image ("walks lighter... guilt and grace") answers without moralizing, resonant via particulars. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in half-success. Thorn reprise shifts family-memory meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (calligrapher's precision in "arc of each brushstroke," light as ink); voice texture lyrical, modulating rhythm with pressure to short, charged altar beats. Dialogue subtextual ("no lock" reveals internal). No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long descriptive swells to terse "she felt something give"); high density, no loops/paraphrase despite drip/light recurrence (purpose-taught pattern). Minor overwriting in opening figuratives ("small eternity," "centuries of pilgrims' tears") risks purple but integrates accumulatively without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms redemption trope via forger's internal-lock key/thorn in drip-time sanctuary; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens unlinking stakes organically. No template echoes; irreplaceable particulars (calibrated treason math) feel inevitable to CR.</comment>
