<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's retrocognitive visions reveal contradictory impulses (service vs. silence of collapse) acting in scene, compelling higher-stakes placement of shards; final endurance of fragile light earned by years of mapping with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions and alignments build density to Charged Poise closure; rekindling with "gentler flame, flickering but true, reaching maybe fifty miles" lands on-page RR with legible diminishment cost versus past glory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pavilion's "lattice of surviving panes that sing when wind threads through their gaps" and workbench shards constrain shard positioning and charge final pulsing image; sensory hierarchy (starlight hum, moth brightness) mirrors Mira's patient faith.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle to prove coincidences) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Orion alignment and shard visions, narrowing to desperate faith; agency in positioning forecloses failure with cost of "fragile and stubborn and alive" hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coincidences-as-language theme emerges organically from prism visions (plague port, vaccine child); final "figure pauses on a hillside and turns toward something that might be hope, might be accident" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in retrocognitive bleeds ("past bleeds through—moments preserved like amber"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "The beacon rekindles," heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The stars pour through the glass humming pavilion, and the pavilion sings its wind-threaded song, and the broken prism catches the light"); no loops, purposeful figurative layering (thistle, silk) pays off without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, post-collapse beacon, and coincidences transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative closure ("might be hope, might be accident, might be both") heightens stakes inevitably from prism visions.</comment>
