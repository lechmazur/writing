<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between protocol/data and intuition/micro-variations acts in scene via embodied listening and hand hesitating at switch; final bell choice earned by father's teaching and prior splice repair, with felt cost of potential lives risked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens (pressure forces stance crystallization) holds through coherent build from data doubt to bell toll DC; closure Charged Poise reconfigures warning options with legible cost in "if she was wrong, they'd be prepared," on-page storm split pays off prediction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary above clouds and bell rope constrain choice (rope proximity vs switch, elevation enables micro-observation); final image of storm splitting charges closure while mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warn without crying wolf) signaled early, tightens via microclimate insight narrowing options (panic vs caution); agency in bypassing switch for bell forecloses panic path with on-page risk cost to villages' trust/lives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from conflicting data/intuition and bell choice; final hush image offers resonant non-literal answer (subtle warnings trusted), reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of atmospheric whispers (e.g., "wind stopped asking questions"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful silence motif propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in "hush/silence" motifs purposeful for tone but slightly scaffold pressure build before zero hour.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of boy-who-cried-wolf via storm prediction and bell vs siren; risk in subtle warning transforms trope, with rope repair priming ingenious low-noise closure.</comment>
