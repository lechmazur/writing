<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and glazier-specific through light/edge metaphors; motivation to illuminate mundane compels micro-choices like repeated stone-throwing with endurance cost. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, leaning toward contemplative harmony over tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from first stone's rings to second's intersections, yielding Charged Poise closure in "keep throwing them...until forced to stop," with conceptual cost of developers' arrival legible in final dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl Bay dawn anchors early, with mist, mercury-water, and atrium constraining choices (stone selection, light refraction); noctilucent clouds and ripples charge final image, filtering through glazier bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protest loss via illumination) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in second stone's "new rings...no one would see again," forcing endurance with felt cost of impending demolition legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty between lines emerges from ripple intersections and atrium light, resonating in final "mundane held all the light...Maren stood witness" without moralizing, reweighting premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with glazier perceptual signature (transparency/structure); rhythmic prose modulates from mist-breath stillness to radiant cadence, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; minor overwrite in ripple metaphors ("expansion, interference, dissolution") risks density dip but coheres as pattern without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh glazier lens transforms ripple/prism motifs into "temporary cathedrals," risking lyric stasis that pays off in charged poise; non-obvious noctilucent synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
