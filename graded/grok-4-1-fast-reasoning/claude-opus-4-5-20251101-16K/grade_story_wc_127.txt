<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to fuse insight with empathy drives absorption of emotions, culminating in earned refusal to sell fakes; contradictory impulses between professional detachment and subsumption act in the transaction beat. Final choice forecloses her dealer identity with felt cost of becoming a vessel. Felix's hollowness pressures her without overwhelming clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional fragments layer to pattern break at "the final barrier dissolving," delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where Vera shares authentic feeling, reweighting half-truths with undeniable personal cost. Single scene anchors orientation early via grotto and client; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk constrains the dusk-timed transaction and charges final image of fading light mirroring emotional awakening. Sensory details (honey-shadow, static charge) filter through Vera's perceptual bias, evolving with static discharge. Micro-setting (blotter petal) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (final authentic transaction vs. half-truths) signaled early, tightens via transformation completion forcing refusal; agency in pressing blotter forecloses fake-dealing path under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in her vessel realization and shared silence. Minor slip: Felix's pressure underdeveloped but coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically from dealings to full truth in closure image of "static-charged silence," reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via real emotions' terror/beauty. Subtext in affectionate detachment modulates to earned awareness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable, perceptual signature via static-sensing bias; voice rhythmic and biased (e.g., "half-truths, always"). Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("I can't sell this"); diction modulates under peak transformation without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer emotion/static without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short punchy transformation lines vs. flowing descriptions). No figurative muddle or artifacts; closure image ("amber grotto faded to darkness") crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotion-dealing premise fresh, transformed via static-sensing and vessel arc; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in CR closure. Specifics (synthetic grief, crystallized joy) synthesize organically, inevitable in hindsight without tropes.</comment>
