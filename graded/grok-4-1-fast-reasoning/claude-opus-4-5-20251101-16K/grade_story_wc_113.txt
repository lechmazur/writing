<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation rooted in unnamed inspiration intensifies through cello note that elicits name; interiority embodied in water-pulling legs and ripple answers. Micro-choices like raising bow as divining rod reveal musical worldview under pressure. Final commitment to archives earns change with cost of barriers defied nightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stains, program, low C build to name etched in memory as RR/Charged Poise. Program slip and fading walls/receding water mark legible before/after with century-breath cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains wading/program-holding; lantern flame on translucent pages charges face reveal. Stains as faces/hands filter through Miriam's gaze, mirroring code stakes. Sensory narrowing to drips, ripples, trembles under musical urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code) signaled early, tightens via note-to-name deepening under Accumulative lens, foreclosing ghost's silence with exhale cost. Agency in sustained C alters knowledge/options for history disruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truths in margins/silences emerges via stains/program silences; final exhale image reconfigures "unstruck chords" waiting without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like ink-in-milk stains shifting to etched name.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with musical perceptual signature ("low C resonated like heartbeat"); rhythm modulates from description to sustained tone intensity. Compression in "wordless conversation" elision taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lantern on program does revelation/atmosphere/foreshadowing; metaphors cohere (ink in milk to etching stone) without muddle in peak note beat. No loops; rhythm varies for propulsion to water-recede cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water damage as ghostly code in musician's lens transforms haunted trope; risk in abstract "in-between" spaces paid off via receding fade. Inevitable hindsight from stains-to-name turn.</comment>
