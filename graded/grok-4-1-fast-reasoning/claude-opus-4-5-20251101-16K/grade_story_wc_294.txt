<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's contradictory impulses—retaining father's money while building honorably—act across shards, earning final donation renunciation with failure's cost. Embodied calm roots in father's watchfulness, shown via client readings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through time-shards building to CR closure: donation reconfigures crossroads from ambush to repair, cost legible in solitude's endurance. Mosaic pattern taught early via train/convergence; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train and flags constrain solitude/territory, charging final perimeter walk image. Sensory musk/sawdust, slanting light filter through Marcus's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crossroads create vs destroy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rise-fall to donation trade-off. Fall summary mutes on-page pressure; cost felt in scattering but lacks live option foreclosure moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of circling paths as second chances emerges from particulars (satchel, flags, train); final image offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Resonance in donation repair, countering father's violence organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: calm observation biases toward stillness/paths. Rhythmic prose modulates reflection to charged poise; no head-hopping, diction matches introspective lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates reflection/action; rhythm varies for dusky cadence. Minor "calm" repetition in mid-shards borders paraphrase loop but doesn't obscure closure; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Circus-train startup at crossroads transforms robber trope via lived rise/fall; donation synthesis feels inevitable from satchel motif. Risky mosaic heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
