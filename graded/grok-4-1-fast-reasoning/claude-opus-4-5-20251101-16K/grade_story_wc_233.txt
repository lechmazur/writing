<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment embodied in "hollow space where faith once lived" and "gently commanding" will over burning limbs; contradictory duty vs. mystery impulses act in ascent and crown removal, earning choice with kingdom cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure at "I choose" and crown clatter; cost legible in "kingdom slept, dreaming of a queen who would not return"; orientation anchored early in climb post-warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight constrain isolation and charge final transformation image; sensory shift to "differently cold" mirrors other-realm stakes; POV filters via queen's authoritative perception of heights.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams/face shadow-self) tightens accumulatively through ascent pressure to choice narrowing return vs. transformation; agency in climb and renunciation forecloses throne with felt kingdom cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of disenchantment as re-enchantment path emerges via shifting images (dream cavern to real grotto, crown ordinary); final fireflies and bleeding stars offer non-literal answer reweighting hollow rule as buried self.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature in authoritative noticing ("will softly commanding her body"); dialogue subtextual in shadow-woman's blade-silk menace; rhythmic prose modulates to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "light that dripped like wound-water") accelerating to ember paths; varied rhythm, no loops; propulsion peaks in crown clatter without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-mirror shadow-self and bleeding stars transforms queen trope; risk in lyric ascent/encounter heightens transformation stakes, inevitable in hindsight via recurring blue-to-ember shift.</comment>
