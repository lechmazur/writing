<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meris's motivation as underachieving mage rooted in grandmother's wisdom compels climb and placement; interiority embodied in numb fingers working carefully. Contradictory embrace of inefficiency shines in realization she remains small but unstoppable. Minor epiphanic summary in "sacred is in the simple" dilutes pure dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mist walk to spire interior, culminating in CR as keystone unfolds memory into permanent light with cost of empty pack and persistent underachievement. Orientation anchored early in who/where/when. One tightening at altar suffices; closure cost legible in "light settled into the ice, permanent now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cloud sea, mist underfoot, brilliant dimness constrain climb and charge activation; recurring keystone absorbs joy, mirrors internal states via unfolding scent/humming. Sensory hierarchy mage-specific: vapor prayer over engines. Spire's ice cathedral evolves with luminance, tactile in placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (simple magic vs. automation) signaled early, deepens at "Nothing happened. Then everything did," narrowing to irreplaceable meaning with felt cost of Guild inefficiency. Accumulative pressure via journey cadence forces stance crystallization in descent. Agency in unstrapping/placement alters options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small sacred vs. scalable spectacle emerges via particulars: stone's memory vs. engines' hum; final image of spire holding garden light reweights premise without moral. Resonance from grandmother's hands/scent, inextricable from arc. No tidy binaries, ambiguity in her unstoppable smallness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: mage notices lingering light, engines' limits. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from ascent tension to poised closure. No dialogue; compression in reflections taught early, legible at spire payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "walk on nothing, sustained by intention" advances stakes/voice). Rhythmic variety, no loops; purposeful lyricism without muddle in peak activation. Minor scaffold in ending refrains ("small," "simple") pattern-taught but borders redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: automated creativity world transformed via garden stone collecting joy engines can't replicate; risk in quiet CR heightens theme. Premise organic, no template echoes; garden folly as collector ingenious inflection on magic.</comment>
