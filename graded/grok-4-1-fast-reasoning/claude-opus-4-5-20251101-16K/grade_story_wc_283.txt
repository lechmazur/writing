<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's secrets and refusal of fixed fate, with concrete micro-choices like sorting buttons revealing persistent agency; embodied inspiration emerges in pattern discovery. Minor flaw: lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance earns closure without safety-hedging. Final return to warehouse shows credible renunciation of stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button patterns and echo build density to CR where prophecy reconfigures as bendable, with cost in village vigilance legible in solstice passage and hourglass turning. Orientation anchors early (descent into warehouse). Single scene adheres to defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (lantern's honey light, button clicks) filters through Mira's priorities, constraining choices via ledger/tools; canyon echo jar as micro-setting charges discovery beat. Warehouse evolution (night to dawn) mirrors internal unraveling without static repetition. Final hourglass turning recharges setting with tactile closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel fire prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via button patterns narrowing to baker's oven specificity; agency in cataloging forces trade-off (stay vs. exodus). Cost unmistakable in "tended their fires carefully," charging Charged Poise at solstice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as "masked possibility" emerges organically from buttons/echo/hourglasses, with final image (turning hourglasses, time breathing) offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like bone buttons from survivors reweight belief's hardening. Ambiguity lingers in village belief split.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in time-frozen motifs; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed cataloging to inspired dawn. Village speech brief but goal-driven, advancing closure. No head-hopping; diction suits quietly inspired keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "click of buttons against sorting trays" advances sound/atmosphere/action); varied rhythm propels from silence to release. No loops/artifacts; figurative language (honey light, fate's fabric) coherent, pattern-taught without muddle in peak unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Buttons as fate-grammar, canyon echo predating words synthesize fresh premise on prophecy rebellion; risk in abstract warehouse logic pays off in concrete village save. Transformation of tropes (prophecy, frozen time) via tactile cataloging feels inevitable.</comment>
