<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's centuries-earned patience compels the vortex reopening, with contradictory sorrow ("I'm sorry") acting alongside duty in the cap-placement beat, revealing values hierarchy with felt cost of release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Charged Poise closure; creature's nature realization tightens stakes, with cost legible in "watching something beautiful leave" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atrium's frost and starlight constrain preservation choices and charge final warming image; "ice began to sing" integrates setting into climax action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of balancing creature's order against unraveling time escalates texturally via entropy insight, forcing agency in cap placement with visible cost of imperfect thaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed time as fragile hope emerges implicitly through seeds-frost-creature progression; final "smile at the stars through the clearing ice" reweights preservation without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in Mira's POV, with perceptual signature (preservation bias) modulating rhythm; "furiously tranquil" phrasing sustains texture under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; high density propels via varied syntax, peaking crisply in "Not crack: sing," heightening sensory propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Entropy-reverser creature synthesizes seed-saving premise into fresh inheritance logic; risk-taking lyric closure heightens stakes via conceptual repricing of time.</comment>
