<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between family comfort and truth act in scene via hesitation before desk decision; earned by recording's revelation with dynasty-ending cost. Interiority concrete via warm crank handle and embodied certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations from cylinder tightens to CR closure where Elara reconfigures legacy with conceptual cost in final writing image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia room and golden shadows constrain choices (desk/telephone proximity) and charge final image; sensory details (dust motes, resonances) filter through Elara's priorities, evolving causally into darkening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (family truth exposure) signaled early, deepens via recording's confession narrowing bury/expose options; agency in desk rise forecloses comfort path with legible dynasty cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of prosperity-on-bones emerges organically from cylinder confession and final writing; resonant non-literal answer in "lays it down" reweights inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (intuition bridge, shadow motifs); rhythmic control modulates reflective density to charged poise at ending, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (shadows motif); minor figurative density in reflective beats (-0.3) but no loops, muddle, or scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gramophone cylinder confession transforms legacy trope into fresh CR via standing waves; bold dynasty-ending risk heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
