<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in control vs. uncertainty intensifies compellingly to improv choice; contradictory impulses (skeptical yet compelled) act in following compass and building device. Interiority concrete via hands/gears; change earned with old precision foreclosed. Minor slip: reflection block ("She understood now") borders unearned epiphany phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coincidences to pattern to CR closure where Vera reconfigures life premise embracing uncertainty, cost legible in "no longer afraid of ashes" and following uncharted path. Orientation anchored early (Vera post-fire ashes). One tightening via underground discovery/improv suffices; no micro turns disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall and bioluminescent moss constrain improv (rhythm as metronome) and charge final image of transformation. Sensory details (crunching boots, mineral air) selective via tinkerer POV, mirroring internal chaos-to-invitation. Vivid, purposeful integration throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control uncertainty vs. befriend it) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pattern/improv forcing stance crystallization. Agency in following/improvising forecloses old path with felt cost (ashes as lost life). Escalation coherent under lens, one tightening narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from particulars (compass leads, mismatched gears improv); final image ("compass trembled... She followed") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in coincidences as "universe's rough drafts" earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tinkerer perceptual signature (mechanisms breathing, time as obedient); diction/rhythm modulates tension (short urgent sentences underground). Prose texture distinct in clock metaphors; no elision or hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud propulsive); metaphors coherent (wound-touching ashes, waterfall metronome) without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak improv beat; every line advances.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer + ancestral compass + uncertainty-navigation device transforms lost-artifact trope via grounded improv under waterfall. Risky quiet CR ending heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
