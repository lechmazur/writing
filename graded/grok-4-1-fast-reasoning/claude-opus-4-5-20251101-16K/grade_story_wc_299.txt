<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between facts and feeling peaks embodied in trembling hands on the cloth, earning the closure call; backstory anchors tilt present choices without flattening pressure. Minor summary of roadie past slightly abstracts early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cataloging to cloth discovery to phone call CR, reweighting purpose with emotional cost legible in "voice steady for the first time in months." Orientation anchors in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and wind-as-applause constrain choices (working boxes leads to chest) and charge final image (limestone echo mirrors memory/joy). Sensory details (dust motes, creaking) filter through Marcus's priorities, evolving with emotional deepening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose via facts post-loss) signaled early, deepens via cloth recognition narrowing fact-vs-feel options under accum lens; agency in call forecloses isolation with vulnerability cost felt on-page. One tightening suffices cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragments bridging loss emerges implicitly from cloth/calls, final image/phone offering non-literal resonant answer ("the bridge between moments") reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars avoid platitudes; quiet complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (facts/numbers under stress) stable, rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise at close; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("I found something of yours") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure without loops or scaffolds; minor long-sentence runs in reflection don't obscure cause/effect. Strategic telling compresses backstory effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie relic in appraiser's hands transforms trope via specific provenance chain; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
