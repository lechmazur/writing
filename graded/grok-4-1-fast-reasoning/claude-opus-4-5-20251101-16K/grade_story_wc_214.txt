<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied in weathered hands on sill and breath syncing with machines; contradictory impulses of fleeing fragility yet embracing crack of solitude earn final renunciation of worldly return with felt isolation cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "motivation to find strength in vulnerability" avoided full 9+ but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in final sweeping image reconfiguring isolation as illuminated choice; cost legible in "no longer waited for the era to remember her" with undeniable emotional price of perpetual unseen endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Broom bristles and viewport constrain her tactile devotion, charging final image where station holds her as she holds purpose; selective sensory hierarchy (hums, creaks, silver streaks) mirrors POV's patient noticing without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vulnerability-embrace signaled early tightens via accumulative deepening at bright meteor blaze forcing whispered prayer trade-off; cost felt in foreclosed worldly armor path but lacks one agency-driven reversal narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of destructive beauty/quiet strength emerges organically from star paths mirroring her arc, resonant in non-literal final image of intersecting patterns without moralizing; yellow glass recharges prior particulars as "small sun against the void."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in star-mourner empathy and syntax modulating from slow arcs to fire-calligraphy rhythm; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-packed lines like "tail stretching across the viewport like calligraphy written in fire"; minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., roots seeking water) risks overwrite but integrates without muddling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor's meteor empathy via lantern glass transforms isolation trope into fresh synthesis of maintenance as rebellion; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, though era backstory echoes familiar abandonment narratives.</comment>
