<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—peripheral avoidance vs. direct smudging—act in scene, earning the descent with 17-year cost; interiority particular via weather-inflected embodiment like "pressure against the ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fever cue to margin-smudging to CR closure ("fractured certainties... descended"); cost legible in "seventeen years of static" reweighting life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring painting and instruments constrain choice (smudging under frost-laced window) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (hum, scratch, auroral light) reflects Mira's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens via smudging reversal narrowing isolation option; agency in micro-choice forecloses 17-year stasis with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of marginal truths emerges organically via painting reveal; final village image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting love/certainties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (probabilities, errors, margins) and rhythmic modulation under revelation pressure; stable close-third POV with clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied openings, no loops); figurative consistency (weather metaphors) coherent in peak smudging beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-oracle frame with encoded sister-love secret transformed via margins mechanic; risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
