<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid interiority via visions of younger/future selves revealing contradictory facets (run from fear, succumb to gravity); motivation to conquer via retracing earns acceptance shift at leap. Minor diagnostic abstraction in "labyrinth of self" summaries dilutes embodiment without harming closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rune shifts building shard density to CR closure ("leaped... falling upward"); pattern taught early ("runes shifted... procedural generation"), transitions legible, cost legible in "surrender between fall and impact." Orientation anchored in first para.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Viaduct glow/puddles recur to constrain (defies gravity, watches drop) and charge final image (empty viaduct waits); selective sensory (phosphorescent sheen, elastic drop) mirrors internal states without overt symbol. Body/setting as micro-setting shapes leap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquer self via retracing) signaled early, escalates via shard density/cadence tightening to acceptance under Accum lens; agency in final leap forecloses force path with conceptual cost felt in convergence. Minor: abstract stakes viscerally thin until visions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acceptance emerges organically from timeline mirrors/paths, final image ("pieces converged") non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral; complexity in periodic eternity's cost lingers. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (elastic time, rune glows); rhythmic texture modulates intensity, diction purposeful for accumulative shards. No elision issues; voice distinct without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel shards; minor overwrites ("darkening brightness") and "fractured timelines" repeats don't obscure closure. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs in peak leap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh procedural gen/time shards synth with gravity defy/leap upward feels inevitable; bold mosaic risks heighten self-conquest stakes, transforms loop trope via acceptance CR without gimmick.</comment>
