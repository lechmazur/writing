<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embodied grief and motivation peak in rag knot's use to light fuse, earning renunciation of hopelessness with contradictory impulses (grief vs. defiance) acting simultaneously; closure choice forecloses passivity with felt emotional cost. Interiority particular via sensory chants and formulas. No diagnostic labels or tidy arcs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from chanting to mosaic discovery ("Make light anyway") to rocket launch as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting grief with conceptual cost in starless sky; one tightening via awareness technique suffices. Orientation anchored early in fortress arrival; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming fortress (wisteria from arrow slits) and fountain mosaic constrain choices (drip leads to note) and charge final image (flowers glow under sparks); sensory hierarchy via Mira's priorities (kerosene scent, papery roses). Details evolve tactilely, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor Sava's note against hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mosaic revelation tightening to endurance agency in rocket launch; cost legible in rag knot's final use and ongoing building ("until dawn if necessary"), foreclosing inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme ("Make light anyway") emerges organically from mosaic/particulars, resonant non-literal answer in gold burst against starless sky reweighting grief/premise without moralizing; subtext in fortress's bloom (war to life) charges closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (nonsense syllables, chemical formulas) biases noticing, stable single-POV with rhythmic modulation under grief; prose texture distinct in incantatory chants returning at climax. No head-hopping or withheld facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes (e.g., "wind moved through the roses with a papery whisper"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (purple waterfalls) without overwriting in peak launch. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks grief in blooming fortress transforms tropes (abandoned site as defiant beauty); risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in mosaic-to-rocket arc, inevitable in hindsight via Sava's hidden note.</comment>
