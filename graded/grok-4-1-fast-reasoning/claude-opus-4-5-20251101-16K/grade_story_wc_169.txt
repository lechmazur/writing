<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's logical dreamer traits shine in concrete actions like recalibrating the gauge and arranging shells into equations, rooting motivation deeply. Interiority feels particular without stock phrasing. Limited on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevent 9+; endurance earned but serene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of trials building to CR closure: final "kept watching" reconfigures hope with endurance cost, legible in ongoing pressure. Single scene coherent; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of grotto membrane shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto and decorated walls (shells, glass) constrain observation and supply data tools, charging final shell mark. Sensory selection (shimmering membrane, whispering tide) reflects POV's mathematical lens. Micro-setting integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early; accumulative escalation deepens via Timeline 23 collapse vs. 31 pivot, narrowing to pressure insight. Agency in patient trials; cost of endurance unmistakable in ceaseless watching. Minor abstractness in stakes tugs from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope as mathematical pressure emerges organically from trials and patterns, resonant in final image reweighting "rising" premise without moralizing. Particulars like sinking balloons in despair timelines build complexity. Counter-reading (patience vs. action) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of chaos-as-equations modulates serenely under pressure; syntax reflects logical mind. Stable close third-person POV; purposeful compression taught early. Distinct texture in rhythmic, image-rich lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, propelling accumulative beats. Metaphors coherent (pages in closing book, balloon piercing membrane). No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak observation moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesizes parallel timelines, probability gauge, and hope equations into organic whole; risk of serene lyricism heightens conceptual stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established patterns. No derivative echoes.</comment>
