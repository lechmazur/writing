<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireth's motivation roots deeply in her calling, with embodied contradiction in her unweaveable self-burden shown through patient weaving despite eternal trap; final endurance forecloses escape with conceptual cost crystallized in "her purpose, her trap, her solace."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering fractal repetitions and burden-weaving patterns toward Charged Poise closure; orientation anchors early in grotto post-snowmelt; cost legible in infinite imprisonment reconfiguring freedom in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto's fractal geometry constrains orientation for weaving and charges final waiting image; starlight, lamp, shingled hush integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal entrapment without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of burden-collection vs. self-entrapment deepens accumulatively as supplicant's weaving mirrors Mireth's fate, narrowing to endurance with on-page cost of perpetual isolation felt in closing reverie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of distributed burdens trading freedom for purpose emerges from weaving particulars, reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to entrapment's solace lingers via fractal infinity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractal iterations and shingled hush biases noticing; stable third-limited POV modulates rhythm with pressure, dialogue sparse but subtextual in supplicant's query and reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "whalebone cathedral" purposeful and coherent, varying rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure's "shingled hush embraced her."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaving premise synthesizes burdens as infinite stone with bold risk in boundary-less trap; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from geometric logic, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
