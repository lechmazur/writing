<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in trembling hands playing despite lifelong denial; final acceptance earned via accumulated voices foreclosing her debunker path with grief/joy laugh. Interiority particular through cello-heard memories revealing flaws. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: voice density overlaps to pattern break in riddle answer, landing CR closure ("you had always been exactly where you needed to be") with conceptual cost of myth surrender. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Persistent cello constraint shapes tactics to final snap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's telescope socket constrains gaze to pulsing star, charging final image; salt-thick air and cello's taut strings tactilely mirror internal hums. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hears voices others miss). No white-room; cliff descent evolves setting coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to decode belief signaled early, deepens texturally as voices overlap narrowing denial options; agency in playing faster forces realization with string-snap cost. One decisive cadence shift suffices. Pressure coheres without static loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lived riddles emerges organically from voice particulars to CR resonance ("marks where you already stood"); final descent image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in glow fade invites ambiguity. No platitudes or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibration-heard voices; rhythmic modulation peaks in overlapping hums. Prose texture distinct, diction POV-apt (debunker phrasing yields to wonder). No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: no loops, varied syntax accelerates to "plays faster" peak. Metaphors purposeful ("hope refusing to be extinguished") without muddle. Final line rhythm recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cello-memory physics/magic debunks to belief; risk in lyric voice-accumulation pays off inevitably at CR. No templates; particular observatory/cello transform myth trope organically.</comment>
