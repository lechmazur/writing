<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's empirically intuitive nature shines in following ants despite logic, revealing contradictory impulses that earn his final renunciation of loneliness. Interiority embodied in panic as water rises and visions appear. Epiphany at "back into himself" borders on summary but ties to prior promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: promise → chip → map → ants → doorway → CR closure with flood cost legible as water seeps in, foreclosing escape. Orientation anchored early in shop. Single tightening via ants amid rising creek suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and wild roses constrain path and charge contrast to flood urgency; cavern blooming at midsummer mirrors "small to vast" and final dawn emergence. Sensory hierarchy via Marcus's map-like perception. Recurrent chip warms tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find doorway) signaled via promise; causal tightening as ants narrow lost paths amid rising creek, forcing crawl with panic cost. Agency in pressing chip crystallizes stance; flood visible price alters options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of decisions as eternal doorways emerges via ant path and visions, reweighted in "every moment was a doorway" without overt moral. Father's whisper callbacks charge closure image organically. Resists tidy morals via ongoing loneliness cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in path-seeing (compass spins, tunnels branch); voice lyrical yet precise, modulating rhythm under flood stress. No dialogue. Compression of journey taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "column of ants, marching with singular purpose" advances plot, echoes theme). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; read-aloud propulsion peaks at "water began seeping." Zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms quest trope via typography-map-ant linkage, inevitable in hindsight; fresh synthesis of printing chip to decision arch feels non-obvious. Risk in illogical ant-follow pays off at closure without gimmick.</comment>
