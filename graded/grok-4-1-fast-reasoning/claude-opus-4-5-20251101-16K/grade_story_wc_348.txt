<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority ("molecular chains as cello phrases") deeply particularizes Elena; micro-choice of simplified message over explanatory pleas earns relational shift with embodied grief cost, but epiphany edges toward diagnostic tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds cleanly through anchored single scene to Charged Poise closure ("phone buzzed... ready to begin the slow work"); foam insight and message-send reconfigure separation with legible relational cost in final breathing pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam constrain insight choice, charging final image; sensory details (copper light, foam clusters) filter through chemist bias without catalog, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant atonement stake tightens accumulatively via chrysalis/foam observations narrowing to message-send agency; conceptual cost of honoring tension ("stretch across the space without expecting it to snap") viscerally felt, though internal alone limits external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of separation-as-connection emerges implicitly from foam/polymer particulars, reweighted non-literally in chrysalis membrane and final weaving image without moralizing; invites ambiguity on response while charging hope with prior grief cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (symphonic polymers, foam mathematics) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic prose modulates from hypnotic observation to charged poise without slippage, prose-as-character intact under insight pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration ("white clusters formed, dispersed, reformed"); minor synonym echo ("thought of" twice in insight para) nudges below peak, but no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer synesthesia with ravine braiding transforms sister-rift trope; risk of solo reflective arc heightens emotional specificity without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via foam insight turn.</comment>
