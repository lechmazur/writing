<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's admission—"I don't know what I am anymore"—reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, earning the final hand-take with visible emotional cost. Interiority embodied via trembling legs and chest-crack precursor. Maya and Chen apply crucible pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: mounting pressure from Maya's declaration forces Kira's stance crystallization in admission, landing Charged Poise closure as hands join with numbness receding as cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene coherent, one tightening via pretense collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating dojo and flickering clouds constrain choices (wind howls during revelations) and charge final image with temporal flux mirroring identity shift. Brain jar reprise integrates tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to Kira's numbness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody to defeat numbness) signaled early, tightens via Kira's agency in discarding arguments, forcing trade-off of "winning" for wholeness; cost legible in "numbness receded, just slightly." Situational pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness via opposites emerges from particulars (shared memories vs. weight/joy split), final hand-take reweights premise without moralizing. Chen's "complementary opposites" integrates as payoff, not thesis. Lingering ambiguity in mutable history enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Kira POV with perceptual signature (echo-self, numbness as flatline). Dialogue subtextual—Maya's "vivify" wounds, Kira's reply pivots. Rhythm modulates from trembling ascent to steadying voice under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayered (e.g., "scattered like light through a prism" advances backstory+interiority). Varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Final line recharges ascent motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sci-fi premise (mutable history, clone dojo arbitration) synthesizes boldly into identity-as-practice, with risk-taking in quiet hand-take closure heightening emotional stakes. Dojo+temporal flux feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming custody trope.</comment>
