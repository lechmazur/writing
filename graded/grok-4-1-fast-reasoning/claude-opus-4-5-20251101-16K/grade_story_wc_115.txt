<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with skepticism driving pattern-seeking despite doubt; contradictory impulses in chasing "buried" stories peak at touching beads, earning final renunciation of silence with felt cost of carrying the truth out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as call patterns and discoveries densify to CR closure ("carrying her mother's story out... the silence--that she would break"), with undeniable conceptual cost in swallowing vs. speaking; orientation anchored early in tunnel entry, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's rust air, dripping "slow heartbeat," and pipes as "industrial ribs" constrain exploration and mirror internal weight; beaded wheel as micro-setting charges final image, filtering through Mira's archaeological gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh mother's swallowed truth) signaled early via calls; accumulative deepening at valve tightens via realization, foreclosing silence with legible emotional cost, though no sharp reversal narrows further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truths' weight emerges from beads/memorial, calls' patterns, mother's confession; final image non-literally answers by breaking silence, reweighting prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (appraising ruins, skeptical patterns); rhythmic control modulates drowsy alertness under isolation pressure, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("concrete crumbles. Everything does"); varied syntax/figuratives purposeful and coherent, no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost tropes via radio-pattern archaeology and inherited guilt; risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes through skeptical voice, transforming abandoned-site cliché organically.</comment>
