<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in grief pressing ribs yet patient tablet handling; final transformation from obsession to purpose earned via planting, with felt cost of releasing haunted hold. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in trembling hands and warm seed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tablet to sprout to fruit-tasting CR, reweighting presence with conceptual cost of infinite gap to truth. Orientation anchors immediately in arbor climb; one tightening via seed-planting suffices, constraint of magnetic field shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arbor's humming branches and swirling aurora clouds constrain planting at center and charge final ripening image; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through translator's priorities. Micro-setting (crystallized bark) tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via analogical resonance to Charged Poise in fruit-tasting; agency in planting forecloses obsessive resistance with legible emotional cost. One reversal (tablet revelation narrows to action) under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of conserved transition emerges organically from lightning analogies and fruit sensations, final tasting reweights ambitions non-literally as "purpose instead of obsession." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, with ambiguity in "pure becoming."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in analogical bridges (e.g., "consciousness moved like electrical current"); rhythmic control modulates from methodical calm to resonant flood. No head-hopping or elision issues; prose as character reflects patient mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands trembled" advances emotion/causality); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts even in peak sprout growth. Propulsion aligns with scene urgency, zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Sumerian physics via magnetic arbor transforms haunting trope into conducted spirits; "touching distance" line risks bold proximity image that heightens stakes inevitably. Organic premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
