<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and contradictory impulses in false starts (knife hand retreats due to truce), earning the closure renunciation with embodied cost; motivation particular and intensifies via reconnaissance; "curiously steadfast" reveals hierarchy of family values over revenge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with false starts building pattern to charged CR closure ("the crack of trust breaking"); cost legible in "It wouldn't fix the breakage"; single scene anchors orientation early (first paragraph barnacled stairs); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pirate market constrains choices (truce halts knife, forces reconnaissance) and charges final image (sunrise paints pier's rot); sensory details selective/POV-biased (brine, copper light via moonshine runner's lens); spatial choreography clear across stalls/exits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust's sound) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via false starts narrowing to watch fob confrontation; agency in standing silently forces confession; cost unmistakable in foreclosed exposure ("could have ruined him") charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of trust as blood-choice emerges organically from confession beat ("They had my boy") and final CR image reweighting betrayal; resonant non-literal answer in "some broken things, known fully, hurt less"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in father's potential speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (silence as needlework); voice rhythmic/modulates (lyric metaphors tighten under dawn pressure); Carver's dialogue natural/subtextual ("I didn't—"); no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stalls sprawled like barnacles" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in confession without figurative muddle; closure image clean ("betrayal's frequency still ringing").</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonshine betrayal in pirate market with "sound of trust breaking" as sonic conceit driving ingenuity; false starts transform recon into inevitability; risk in quiet non-exposure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
