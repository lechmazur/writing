<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of gentle radical through steel arm sacrifice and refusal to hate, with contradictory mercy driving the naming choice; internal conflict in aberrant mercy vs. post-fire logic peaks in tears after Safiya vision, earning closure renunciation of hatred with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from plaza walk to tessera touch/vision/release, culminating in CR closure ("Safiya... I see you") reweighting memory as infrastructure with lifetime cost legible in final lines; orientation anchored immediately, single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shattered sky and ash-stained mosaic constrain Vera's barefoot navigation and retrocognitive risk, charging final image of steel arm glinting under fractured light; sensory selectivity (warm tessera, ash on tongue) mirrors POV urgency without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve names vs. madness critique) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Safiya vision narrowing options (drown in past or rename); cost felt in gasp/tears and lifetime commitment, though internal opposition lacks one micro-reversal for peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as infrastructure emerges organically from tessera vision to "names worth speaking aloud," with final warmth/cold distinction offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting fire's destruction; no moralizing, ambiguity in mercy's "pointlessness" lingers potently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (history under heels, light through water) modulating rhythmically under vision stress; prose texture distinct in lyrical compression ("rent by cataclysm"), fully legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "The plaza dissolved" sequence integrates action/image); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (heat vs. warmth) without muddle; minor elevated diction fits librarian radical without peak drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc retrocognition via touch for "renaming" rebuild transforms trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in aberrant mercy premise, with steel arm/tessera charging inevitable hindsight closure.</comment>
