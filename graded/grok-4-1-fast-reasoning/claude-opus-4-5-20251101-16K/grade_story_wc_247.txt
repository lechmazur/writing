<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to map silence into music roots deeply in her deafness and past fame, compelling her approach to the mother-child duo; contradictory joyful sorrow embodies in her rusty signing and kneeling gesture. Final micro-choice to dance hands with the girl earns a bridge from isolation, foreclosing solitude with relational cost. Backstory anchors to present camera use without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in the girl's mimicry and final shutter click, reweighting silence as symphony with emotional cost of lost sound world legible in "heart's silent archive." Single scene orients instantly (harbor under moon); no causality breaks, one tightening via interaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor's silver gleam and swaying boats filter through Mira's silent perceptual bias, constraining her viewfinder framing and approach to the pier. Recurring moonlight charges final image of dancing hands. Selective sensory detail (gestural "rhythm of waves") integrates with action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence to music) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through signing encounter and hand-dance, narrowing isolation with agency in approach and mimicry invitation. Cost of past losses viscerally felt in "lost so much," charging final reconfiguration. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as full symphony emerges organically from gestures and motifs (hands, camera frame), culminating in non-literal CR: "silence could sing" reweights premise without moralizing. Joyful sorrow subtext layers ambiguity in mother's laugh visibility. Final image resonates with prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (gestural "language of hands"); lyrical rhythm modulates from observation to intensity in hand-dance. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("I come here to watch... to see the music"), advances bond. No head-hopping, diction fits ex-musical ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and rhythmic phrasing ("tide pulling away from shore"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Read-aloud ear sings in peak: "danced her fingers to match the sway." Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, empty camera as silence-framer, and gestural music transforms trope of loss into bridge-building CR. Risky lyric compression of observation-to-connection feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, bold in "symphony... only the deaf could hear."</comment>
