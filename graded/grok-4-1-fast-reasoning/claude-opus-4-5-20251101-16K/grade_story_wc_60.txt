<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous skeptic's contradictory doubt and persistence drive micro-choices like following literal breadcrumbs despite expecting metaphors, earning the final tender unsticking; interiority embodied in counting steps/breaths/doubts and soft weeping. Final renunciation of safe disbelief shows hierarchy of values with time/exhaustion cost. No label-speak undermines peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs accumulate to box discovery, patient unsticking deepens density over days to RR closure in lid separation and memories spiraling free with patience cost legible in "millimeters" of progress. Orientation anchored early in geese pause and fountain city. No shards exceed scope; elisions motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via sealed box requiring "tenderness and stubbornness," charges final image as dry fountains weep; hush "resistant quiet" mirrors skeptic's defiance, filtering through her priorities (e.g., vines/colonades as path). Sensory hierarchy narrows under descent stress. Recurrent fountains evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via breadcrumb path to 23-day unsticking ordeal narrowing options; agency in persistent micro-tools (nails/water/blade) forecloses rushed shattering with exhaustion cost felt in sleeping beside box. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of realistic imagination vs. doubt emerges organically from skeptic doubting "impossible things" yet persisting, answered non-literally in mother's laugh "unstuck from time" reweighting prior breadcrumbs/patience without moralizing. Particulars like fused glass shift motif meaning. Counter-reading (post-hoc doubt) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable with perceptual signature in "realistic imagination" biasing literal crumbs over symbols; diction/rhythm modulate from defiant hush to softening hush, compressing under 23-day stress consistently. No elision or head-hopping; voice as character in luminous phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "tenderness to respect what was fragile, the stubbornness to persist" advancing character/atmosphere; varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative coherence in light "carrying voices and images." Propulsion peaks cleanly at lid lift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic quest via paused geese/breadcrumbs in memory-trapping fountains, transforming trope through sidereal patience payoff; risk in lyric time-elision heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight as doubt yields to "quiet defiance against forgetting."</comment>
