<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessaly's motivation to gather and weave intensifies credibly to self-dissolution, with embodied interiority peaking in "felt herself dissolving, her consciousness spreading thinner." Minor slip in lacking overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the collective sing, but final change earned under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via song-gathering to collective weave, closure as RR/Charged Poise in mica blaze with cost ("Thessaly felt herself dissolving"). Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse/mirror world; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica window and alchemical trees constrain choices (gathering paths, dimming tree forces collective) and charge final blaze image. Sensory hierarchy vivid via POV (translucent fingers vibrate, breath misting); details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via woven dawns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "realm dying faster" tightens to last-tree dimming and collective agency. Visible cost in Thessaly's dissolution forecloses her prior scattered state, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory against isolation emerges organically from song-sharing to final "communities that had forgotten...remembered now." Resonant non-literal answer in spreading fissures reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV lyrical texture with perceptual signature (vibrating fragments, threads materializing); rhythm modulates to crescendo in singing/climax. Minimal dialogue ("Sing") natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "threads of amber light materialized" advances plot/character/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; coherent metaphors peak cleanly in "swaddle...like a mother protecting an infant."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeper weaving light from songs transforms loss tropes; "bound release" in dissolution feels inevitable. Mica window's reprise and communal dawn-weaving heighten stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
