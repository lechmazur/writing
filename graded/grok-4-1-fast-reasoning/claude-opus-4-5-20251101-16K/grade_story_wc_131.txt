<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—invisibility versus purposeful revelation—act simultaneously when she descends the shaft, earning her final choice with the visible emotional cost of "a lock finally turning" in her chest. Interiority is concrete and tactile-specific, like "catalogued her findings by touch alone." Flawless single-POV execution with micro-choices under pressure; girl's understanding dialogue reveals status shift without convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Maren's hidden discoveries to girl's arrival as pattern break, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure where mutual visibility reconfigures her isolation with legible emotional cost ("something shifted in Maren's chest"). Orientation anchored early via pipe chases and dawn outage. Single scene with seamless transition from hidden to revealed; one tightening via footsteps suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: hidden passages enable Maren's emergence and caches, pipe chases shape her worldview, charging final image of "two figures finally visible... carrying fragments of the past." Sensory details selective and POV-biased (tactile primacy in darkness). Dawn progression from "sapphire hush" to "golden morning" mirrors reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (invisibility vs. needed visibility) signaled early, tightens via girl's anguished search forcing Maren's descent under Accumulative lens; agency in emergence forecloses hidden life with relational cost. One deepening via overheard whisper narrows options. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden preservation emerging through caches and tape reweights via final image of shared walk "carrying fragments... toward uncertain light," offering non-literal resonance on memory's visibility without moralizing. Subtext in sense memory and "gifts for those who might someday need them" builds organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with Maren-specific perceptual signature (tactile/methodical noticing). Dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I think this belongs to you"), distinct voices (Maren's rough disuse vs. girl's soft understanding). Rhythmic control modulates from hushed prose to charged emergence; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "dust gathered like gray snow" integrate image/action. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; simile density purposeful in atmospheric build, zero muddle at closure. Varied rhythm accelerates in descent/emergence beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-hidden-anatomy premise transforms tropes via Maren's dweller role and tape caches; risk in invisible-to-visible arc heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern of kindnesses.</comment>
