<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quietly driven trait yields embodied interiority and micro-choices like collecting shells over weeping; final whistle and mapping earn closure via prior pattern obsession, with contradictory drive toward self-inclusion in destruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to CR closure in watcher's step and Mirin's mapping; cost legible in "city began its slow descent into revelation" and final image reconfiguring readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turtle shells as micro-setting constrain mapping and crack outward from watchers, charging final groan underfoot; sun "bleached everything white and terrible" mirrors dread without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering expedition's warning escalates via whistle agency to watcher awakening under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in cascading cracks and walking horizon foreclosing escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of communicative breaking emerges organically from spirals/cracks to reweight "ready" in final image; resonant non-literal answer in Mirin's persistent mapping amid endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with pattern-biased perceptual signature ("nautilus grooves," "language of spirals"); rhythmic diction modulates from quiet buildup to thin reedy note without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor figurative density ("gold and horror") in climax slightly thickens peak without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell cartography and waking watchers transforms tropes; risk in pattern-as-language inevitability heightens conceptual stakes to rare poise.</comment>
