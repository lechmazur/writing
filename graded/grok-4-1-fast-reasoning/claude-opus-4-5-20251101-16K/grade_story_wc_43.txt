<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Characters deeply motivated by grief and redemption; Eduardo's contradictory blame/need shown in shard gift and dialogue; Maya's micro-choices (calling Daniel, hymning) earn closure change with relational cost. Minor label-speak in "decisively kind" doesn't flatten pressure. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from blood work cue to shard reunion to final dawn image as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via results accelerating reunion. Closure cost legible in Eduardo's death and wholeness: "Perfect" breath seals reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clouds and room micro-setting constrain and charge final image (clouds meet windows, surround in radiance). Sensory hierarchy (visual blush, scent, guitar sound) filtered via Maya's noticing; dust motes, air sway integrated into action. Recurring clouds mirror internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via blood work → shard fit → death; agency in Maya's call and playing forecloses isolation path. Cost felt in Eduardo's shallow breaths and surrender. Escalation coheres under lens without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mundane-made-sacred emerges via hymning and shards; final scent image reweights grief-to-wholeness without moralizing. Subtext in silences and fitting edges invites ambiguity on love's failures. Resonance from particulars, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Maya with perceptual signature (melodies in ordinary); rhythmic prose modulates to quiet intensity. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Eduardo's crack, Daniel's whisper); no head-hopping, diction fits serene therapist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors ("pulsing stillness," cathedral of simple things) purposeful and pattern-taught early without muddle. Minor figurative density in peak reconciliation doesn't obscure closure image; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy, literal shard reunion, scent-as-hope transforms deathbed trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens emotional stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via prior grief cues.</comment>
