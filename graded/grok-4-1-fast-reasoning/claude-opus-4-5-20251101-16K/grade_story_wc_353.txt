<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between stubborn forcing and learned humility acts in scene via rebuilt approach; final strumming endurance earned with tears and ache as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ritual to fragile note (Charged Poise RR); cost legible in "fingers ached" and half-present music reconfiguring silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alder branches and porcelain constrain creation (strings strung between); insulator cracks charge final vibration image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Density deepens from failed instruments to absorber-strum under Accumulative lens; agency forecloses forcing path with fragile sound's cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final fragile notes non-literally answer "world too tired to speak," reweighting silence via particulars without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical symphonic signature ("percussion of imagined footfalls") biases perception consistently; no elision, stable close third.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and coherent metaphors ("frozen lightning"); zero loops, no artifacts in peak strum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Insulator-as-sound-map synthesizes industrial relic with symphonic grief inevitably; risk of lyric quiet pays off in charged return.</comment>
