<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to compress eternity is rooted in concrete grief (bottled whisper) and drives micro-choices like transcribing frost; embodied in stained fingers and final warm bottle. Contradictory impulses (personal hope vs. library harmony) act in her defiant printing. Final acceptance earned via rupture's vision, foreclosing chaos path with library's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns build density to rupture's reconfiguration. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (glass orchard, Miriam's press). Closure as Charged Poise in "empty bottle still warm," with cost in shuddering books and no more frost—before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard's crystalline trees and cloud sea constrain ritual (frost on bark, heart tree base). Sensory hierarchy: inks' nameless colors, chimes, rustling pages reflect cryptic POV. Evolves causally in climax scatter; charges final image among fallen books.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eternity compression) signaled early, tightens via final page and release to rupture. Agency in opening bottle forecloses perfection with visible cost (books fall, awakenings spread). Accumulative escalation reweights via pattern break at "rupture came... with recognition."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of negotiable reality/grief transmutation emerges from frost chaos destabilizing precision. Final image reconfigures: acceptance "rendered in perfect type" answers compression quest non-literally. Resonance from particulars like stirring texts, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: "grammar of cold," "inks that contained no color names." Rhythmic modulation peaks in rupture's compression ("eternity squeeze... width of a breath"). Purposeful elision of visions pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "frost wrote equations that destabilized perfect systems" advances method/stakes). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (wax, accordion). Propulsion peaks unmarred in "daughter at seven, at seventeen, at seventy."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost equations + bottled breath rupture time in glass orchard. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes (library cost), inevitable in hindsight via early patterns. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
