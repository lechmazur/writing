<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete embodiment of skepticism yielding to "courageously kind" care; contradictory impulses act in picking/dropping tile then recommitting, earning final endurance with exhaustion cost. Final transcription renunciation of dismissal forecloses skeptical isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tile pickup initiates memory density buildup to transcription closure as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting belief with attention; cost legible in "worked through exhaustion." Orientation anchored early in tower/whales; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower, obsidian tile, whales vividly constrain choices—tile as tool for resonance, migration as live clock pressuring transcription; final whale farewell charges image, mirroring "unsung notes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (engage/transcribe memories) signaled early, escalates via density of entangled impressions and exhaustion; agency in studying patterns narrows options to full commitment, with felt cost in weeks-long care charging poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of attention sculpting space emerges from particulars like whale songs/memory web, without statement; final image ("picked up her pen") non-literally answers skepticism, reweighting premise with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (skeptic cataloging patterns amid mystery); rhythmic modulation builds from stark tile shift to lyrical closure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyricism ("unheard symphony") woven into action; zero loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in transcription beats without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as neural resonance device entangled across time transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tile/journal pivot.</comment>
