<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—reticence vs. need to testify—act in scene through her strange smile and pocketed crystal; final readiness earned by 17-year vigil with visible cost of worn innocence. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in weathered hands and crystal warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound fragments builds to CR closure ("wilderness, ungovernable and eternal") with conceptual cost of innocence eroded, legible in final image of pocketed crystal; orientation anchored early, one tightening via own-voice echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring crystal and shadowed library constrain vigil/choices and charge final image ("shadows retreat," library "breathes"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (dust footsteps, dawn rainbows), integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth vs. static language) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through sound fragments to testimony readiness; agency in endurance forecloses silence with felt irony/cost in "expression strange on her face."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (language as living wilderness) emerges organically from crystal sounds and final image repricing dictionary "butterfly pinned under glass"; resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sonic fragments, light fractures); rhythmic control modulates reflective hush to charged dawn climb, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion weaves reflection into action (crystal "hummed against her palm"), zero figurative muddle in peak (own-voice) beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic crystal and language evolution transforms library trope; risky quiet CR ("library breathed") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
