<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verai's motivation to preserve language through texture translation roots deeply in lineage and loss, culminating in earned self-sacrifice when she presses the diamond to her arm. Contradictory impulses surface subtly in her futile explanation to grandson, revealing isolation. Final renunciation forecloses human transmission with felt cost of linguistic death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from diamond's discovery to birds' patterns guiding self-translation, holding to CR closure where echo joins canyon's song. Orientation anchors immediately in canyon and bone tower. Cost legible in diamond's disappearance and eternal transmission sans human voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes constrain choices as translation instrument, charging final image of mist-fractured light. Sensory details (porous bone's breathy tones, wind's ancient scent) filter through Verai's priorities. Recurring copper veins mirror internal state via gold spectra.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to immortalize dying language tightens via birds' intervention, forcing self-translation that narrows options to personal erasure. Agency in endurance culminates in arm-pressing act with conceptual cost of language's human extinction. Escalation reweights stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of defiant preservation emerges organically from texture-to-echo translation, reweighted in travelers hearing "words that felt like colors." Final image answers refusal of silence without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like unpronounceable dawn hue avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with textural diction (e.g., "swallowed molten metal") sustains perceptual signature biased toward sounds and grains. Stable third-limited POV; purposeful compression teaches pattern early. Rhythm modulates from contemplative to resonant closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (diamond's crack as "tunnel of echoes"). Rhythmic variety propels from setup to "echo carried into the canyon and didn't return." No artifacts dull peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of copper-veined storytellers, texture-language, bird-mediated echoes transforms preservation trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable diamond-canyon logic. Final travelers' report feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
