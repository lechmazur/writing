<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and contradictory impulses peak in "She should have run. Legacy's burden kept her rooted," earning the entrapment choice with visible cost; minor over-articulation of realization ("She understood now") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries tightening to CR closure in final image of ivy tightening and walls drawing her in, cost legible in entrapment; orientation anchored early, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy as recurring micro-setting constrains final choice (tightens ankle) and charges closure image; vivid, selective sensory integration (cold stone, vibrations, ash) reflects POV bias without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover walls' dreams via legacy) escalates accumulatively through diaries/negative to vision, forcing agency in whisper/press; cost unmistakable in physical/emotional trap, one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of burdensome legacies emerges organically via grandmother's warning and walls' mourning need; resonant CR in final lines non-literally answers "what walls dream about" with conceptual cost of eternal company.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of acoustic sensitivity (vibrations no one else senses); rhythmic prose modulates tension, whisper carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful "legacy's burden" repetition anchors motif without loops, minor paraphrase in reflective blocks contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic memory and sentient architecture risks bold CR payoff in walls' inhabitation dream; no derivative echoes, transformations feel inevitable from early premise.</comment>
