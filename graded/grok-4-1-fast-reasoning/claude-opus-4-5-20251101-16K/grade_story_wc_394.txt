<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vex's contradictory impulses toward failure and reaching act in kaleidoscope visions and note-scratching, earning final arrow-tip grasp with embodied harmony; steadily curious trait reveals hierarchy of values under deadline pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of visions building to charged poise closure in "She began to build," with felt cost legible in drum pop and looming sea claim.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea's lurch and drum hiss constrain build choice, charging final image; kaleidoscope as micro-setting filters possible selves through Vex's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drum seal failure tightens deadline stake, forcing endurance agency in tip grasp; cost unmistakably viscerally narrows options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "make some noise nobody's ready for" reweights yearning premise non-literally via arrow harmony, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "gears within gears... that hurt to follow" biases toward impossible edges; rhythmic modulation heightens to resolute close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds propel via dense images; varied rhythm peaks cleanly in "metal sang against her palm" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yearning algorithm synthesizes Architect codes into mathematical ache with irreverent risk; canyon-glider reprise transforms trope into inevitable poise.</comment>
