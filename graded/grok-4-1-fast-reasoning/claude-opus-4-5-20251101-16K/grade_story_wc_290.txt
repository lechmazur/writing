<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia and prudent adventure act simultaneously during organ play, with embodied panic ("chest tightened") compelling the altar insertion despite rising dread, earning the key's grasp with grief-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: memorized notes → "transfix itself" → timed altar access → shuddering escape; final Charged Poise image of key/compass reconfigures options with undeniable grief-price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial anomalies ("too deep, too angular") constrain organ tactic and descent; starlight anchors opening/closing, charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Claustrophobia/mutiny stake tightens via one-hour window ("precious hour"), forcing agency in descent/escape with visible cost as church "shudders."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emergent theme of inherited rebellion resonates in final key/compass image, reweighting grief/defiance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable claustrophobic POV filters geometry as "predatory breath," with rhythmic modulation building to escape propulsion; no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion via varied syntax ("Click. The floor opened."); purposeful figures like "geometry sings" integrate without muddle or loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny premise ingeniously synthesized with organ geometry and compass, transforming haunted church trope via personal inheritance logic.</comment>
