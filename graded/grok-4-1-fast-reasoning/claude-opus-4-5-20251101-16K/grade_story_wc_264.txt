<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between dreamlessness and purpose, embodied in "dreams could be carried without being possessed," earning her endurance with visible cost; micro-choices like whispering coordinates reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final vigil—possibilities multiplying like stars reconfigures her stance; orientation anchored early, one tightening via archive visions suffices with felt dreamless cost legible in "chess clock stayed frozen."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flowers and dune constrain choices (door opens to salt/pollen air) and charge final image (flowers close as mountains loom with moss); selective sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities, mirroring internal uncertainty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to cultivate sparks tightens via "everywhere at once" visions narrowing to collectible coordinates; agency in charming archive drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with dreamless endurance as on-page cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of potential in uncertainty emerges organically from sparks and wave functions, resonating non-literally in final "stars that might, someday, be born" reweighting midnight as garden; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in quantum-tinged lyricism ("reality had grown soft") stable in single POV; purposeful "everywhere" slippage taught early fits archive concept, modulating rhythm with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-stacked sentences; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "time was not a line but a garden" integrate without muddle in peak archive interaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-post-apoc synthesis transforms tropes via dreamless guard charming crystalline futures; risk-taking in "occasionally everywhere" heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at moss-returning mountains.</comment>
