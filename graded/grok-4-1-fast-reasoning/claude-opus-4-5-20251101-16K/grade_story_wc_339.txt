<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with analytic trait clashing embodied tremble at the log discovery ("hands trembled"), earning the closure renunciation of not sharing; contradictory impulses act in the methodical survey amid personal shock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via deepening discoveries to CR closure in the ascent with snow globe and "never share" cost; orientation anchored in opening pressure para; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains via preservation and decay (books pulp, cabinets hold), charging final globe glow; sensory narrowed to headlamp beam and gloved touch under crisis urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evidence recovery deepens via log transmission reversal, narrowing to personal reconfiguration with felt cost of oblique grief acceptance; one tightening sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear persistence emerges from mother's message particulars and globe reprise, offering resonant CR without statement; final lighthouse glow reweights loss as displacement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with analytic perceptual signature ("quietly analytic by nature"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "folded like paper cranes," eliding without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; minor "impossible" recurrence purposeful for pattern payoff at glowing globe, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving temporal fold with heirloom constraint heightens stakes organically; risk of sci-fi intrusion via log transforms archaeology trope inevitability.</comment>
