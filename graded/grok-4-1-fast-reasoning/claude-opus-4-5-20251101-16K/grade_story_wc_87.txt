<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in regrets clashing with the text-sending micro-choice, embodied via compass tremble mirroring emotional interference; earned renunciation of hiding forecloses isolation with relational cost. Diagnostic phrasing like "bill had come due" borders therapy-speak but stays anchored in concrete cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in "She hit send before the doubt could swallow her," reconfiguring direction with vulnerability cost legible in the final dock image; single scene, orientation instant, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coastal details (salt wind, bobbing kayaks, utility poles) selectively mirror internal drift and constrain reflection on dock edge; compass as micro-setting charges final image, POV-filtered through navigator's eye without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Daughter's text deepens dominant stake of alignment under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in send with exposure cost; single tightening forecloses safe distance, charging poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Navigation motif emerges organically from poles/stars/compass, final image ("follow stars... home") resonantly reweights regrets without moral; ambiguity in "maybe too late" invites complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (celestial bias in "stars don't lie"); rhythmic prose modulates melancholia to hope, diction controlled and particular without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration; no loops/artifacts, minor abstract phrases like "perpetual loss" advance without drag, ear-test clean throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Navigator metaphor transforms midlife regret trope via specific compass/poles synthesis; fresh in hindsight via "utility poles" as safe-fallback image, bold without gimmick.</comment>
