<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stoic composure amid deep grief) act in scene via note-sealing amid rising water; final endurance earned by inherited cartographic devotion with visible cost of time/obsession. Interiority concrete and embodied in tidal metaphors. Father's "stoically sensitive" label anchors trait without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifact discoveries and note ritual build density to Charged Poise closure in final vigil image, reconfiguring erasure threat with conceptual cost of pavilion's imminent claim ("water had risen another centimeter"). Orientation anchored immediately in drawbridge/pavilion. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion and rising waterline constrain choices (wading, epoxy-sealing notes) and charge final amber-lit vigil. Sensory hierarchy surveyor-specific: measurements mix with poetic bias ("bones of something that refused to disappear"). Micro-setting (columns/cracks) guides actions purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document abandoned dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via marble/button finds and water rise, narrowing options to endurance with legible cost in structure's doom. Agency in ritual micro-choices forecloses erasure path. No reversals needed; density reweights pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically from woven losses (music, families), resonating in final vigil image that reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in note-hiding implies future witness amid dissolution. Complexity lingers in infinite branching stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: cartographic/archaeological noticing ("coordinates," "waterline"). Rhythmic control modulates from precise surveys to hushed lyricism under closing pressure. Prose texture distinct, syntax reflects stoic sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies with scene (short urgent notes amid flowing descriptions). Figuratives purposeful ("hushed blaze") without muddle, propelling to closure. Read-aloud ear perfect, no overwriting in peak artifact beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor hiding poetic notes in doomed pavilion transforms climate-loss trope via specific ritual/devotion. Quiet Charged Poise ending risks bold lyricism, heightening stakes organically. No derivatives; voice/ premise cohere singularly.</comment>
