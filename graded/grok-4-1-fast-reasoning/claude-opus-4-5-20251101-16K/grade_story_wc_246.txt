<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (certainty as arrogance vs. action despite uncertainty) act in scene through writing the signal; final reframing choice earned by prior mistake's causality with cost of accepting error. Interiority concrete via pen-handling and anomaly-gazing. Flaws drive inevitable reframing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mistake reflection to signal-sending realization; CR closure ("nothing was final. Everything was contingent") lands on-page with conceptual cost of perpetual contingency felt in final anomaly image. Orientation anchored early at station/anomaly. Single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Anomaly and pen constrain choices (signal via contingent networks; pen as reminder against creation) and charge final image (anomaly shimmer, pen touch mirroring bent reality). Sensory selection POV-biased (prismatic nib, pooling time). Micro-setting integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframe colony ship error) signaled early; accumulative deepening via "unbend to new curves" realization narrows options, forces agency in signal transmission with felt cost of uncertainty. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (interpretation edits history via contingency) emerges from particulars like signal-planting and pen; final image ("stars bending toward each other") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time-eddy signals, prismatic light); rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity. Prose texture purposeful, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy realizations amid flowing reflection), propulsion aligns with accumulative build. "Wrong turns could become right ones" line exemplifies clear, image-driven closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi anomaly with philosophy of contingent history/interpretation; fresh angle transforms tropes via specific reframing calculus. Risky lyric reflection heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
