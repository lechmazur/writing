<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in borrowed heartbeat, compelling calm choices amid enormity; contradictory impulses subtle in "borrowed time better than anyone" enabling work. Final endurance of teacher's wish earned with felt cost of ticking pulse. 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice forecloses single-truth paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from humming to mirror showing possibilities, cadence tightens with "worked faster." On-page CR closure in final mirror/hope image with cost of "borrowed heartbeat ticking." Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains painting and charges final rainbow/mirror image; sensory hierarchy (echoes amplify song, lilac/wet stone) filters through Vesper's priorities. Vivid, purposeful integration into action. 9+ test: object constrains choice and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirrors before bells) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via verse progression and "worked faster"; agency in humming/painting forecloses inevitability with time pressure cost. Escalation coheres under lens, visible trade-off in borrowed pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reflection-as-window emerges organically from painted paths; final image reweights premise non-literally ("hope, painted in impossible colors"). Resonance from particulars avoids morals. 9+ test: resonant answer reweights without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (magic in rainbows/lullabies); rhythmic control modulates intensity, stable single POV. No elision issues; compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens. 9+ test met fully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; metaphors coherent (e.g., "bruised violet," "silk" boundary). Zero loops/artifacts; peak beats clear. 9+ test: zero issues, propulsion heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic realism (lullabies bending mirrors) transformed via borrowed heart/possibilities; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early cues; no derivatives.</comment>
