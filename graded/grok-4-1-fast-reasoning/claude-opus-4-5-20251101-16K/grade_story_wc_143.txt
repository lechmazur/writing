<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under endurance pressure, as in holding the sand grain while imagining the crater's impact; mild contradictory impulses (reverence vs. impending loss) act in scene, earning final renunciation with felt cost, though slightly poised without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; sun cresting and "melancholy... soft, almost golden" delivers legible conceptual cost of preservation amid erasure; orientation anchored early, one tightening at first light suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Summit and crater rim constrain choices via altitude hush and overlook; silver nitrate papers and sand grain as micro-settings charge final image, with sensory hierarchy (fogging breath, silver shadows) filtered through inspector's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve crater's wholeness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via horizon light and darkening papers narrowing to witnessing trade-off; agency in waiting/outlasting forces stance crystallization with melancholy cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of measured witnessing vs. forgetting emerges organically from grain, photos, and epochs; final image ("shadows retreat... dawnlit melancholy") offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration reweighting space age progress without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (rocks' stories, dawning hush); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to golden resolve, diction biased toward geological reverence without withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful "six" cadence accumulating texture; no loops, but minor overwriting in reflective similes ("violence that had created something beautiful") slightly blurs peak dawn beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crater preservation via timed chemistry and inherited grain reweights space age trope through inspector's endurance; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without derivative hedging.</comment>
