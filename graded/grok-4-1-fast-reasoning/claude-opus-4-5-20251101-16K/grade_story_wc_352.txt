<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism-minded perception drives concrete micro-choices like angling through the doodle's trajectory at thresholds; earned shift to guardianship in chamber realization forecloses pure extraction with moral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as threshold passages build density toward CR closure; "She had entered once before, unprepared, and barely escaped" anchors orientation early, with final emergence reconfiguring purpose under time constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravity inversion and luminous mist constrain choices ("pushed herself downward—upward now"); quartz wall passage charges pivotal chamber entry, mirroring internal prism parsing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve combinations) tightens via timed inversion and seed defenses, forcing selective transcription; "forty minutes remaining" makes cost legible without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guardianship theme emerges organically from seed philosophy realization in chamber; final "fire banked and ready" reweights extraction premise with non-literal guardianship answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with prism-signature ("overlapping spectrums," "parsed into overlapping truths"); rhythmic modulation intensifies in dense mist without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action with perception ("stone part around her like water"); minor mist repetition builds texture purposefully, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prism-sight, inversion physics, and vigilance seeds transforms quest trope; risk in permeable reality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doodle spiral.</comment>
