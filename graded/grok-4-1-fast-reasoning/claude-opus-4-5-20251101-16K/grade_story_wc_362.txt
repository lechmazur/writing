<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: Vera's embodied laugh "until tears froze on her cheeks" reveals contradictory grief/joy, compelling her final renunciation of publication with felt cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via ritual persistence despite revoked funding. Final choice earned by layered realizations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns build density to CR closure where "truthful lies" reweights premise with conceptual cost (no vindication, just tending). On-page closure via kneeling/sensing emotions, prism finale. Orientation anchored early in arbor at dawn; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz arbor/mist/frost constrain ritual choice and charge final prism-rainbow image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (hush to pulse/colors) reflects Vera's attuned perception. Micro-setting (car window frost) evolves causally, lived-in via pressing palms to earth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotion absorption) signaled early, tightens via prism visions shattering assumptions, narrowing to endurance (tend garden). Cost legible in "never publish"; agency in retrieving prism forces stance crystallization. Accumulative deepening reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "truthful lies" emerges organically from grandmother's fabrication becoming real, resonant in final "prism caught the sun and scattered rainbows." Non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing; earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: "language of stillness," frost fractals as divination. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in pulsing colors beat. Prose texture biased to Vera's mystic attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion: metaphors like "frozen prayers" purposeful, no loops/muddle. Varied rhythm accelerates to "pillars that hummed," breathes in realizations. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost/prism divination transforms "objects absorb emotions" via engineered belief-into-truth. Risky paradox ("lies had become true") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
