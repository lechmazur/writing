<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Diligent copyist trait roots motivation in past skills, compelling broadcast despite risks; embodied glow in hands reveals character under alcove isolation. Final singing choice earns renunciation of safety with felt cost of funerals. Contradictory resolve amid known peril acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in singing onset; "She knew what she risked" and funerals anchor cost legibly. Orientation anchors Maren/alcove/famine early. Single scene holds without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mist constrains broadcast timing (thickest nights), embers ward cold for ink; glowing hands as micro-setting enable hidden texts, charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (orange glow vs grey) mirrors internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle stories vs regime) signaled in cloaking, deepens via purges/funerals; agency in tuning/singing forecloses safety with isolation cost. Escalation accumulates to broadcast under Accumulative lens, pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories reviving silence emerges via dust motif shifting to "dust...learning to speak"; final propagation image non-literally answers famine with change possible. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mist as "curious beast"); lyrical diction/rhythm ("thistled calm") modulates to charged poise without elision. Voice texture distinct, prose reflects resolve under risk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images (phosphorescent ink); purposeful metaphors (dust speaking) pattern-taught without muddle. Minor figurative density in peak broadcast build doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Music-as-story-smuggling premise transforms copyist trope freshly; lyric Accumulative risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glowing notation/broadcasts.</comment>
