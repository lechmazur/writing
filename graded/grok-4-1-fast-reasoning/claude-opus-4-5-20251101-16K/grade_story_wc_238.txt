<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's guilt-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied tremor and confession, earning her final renunciation of past lies with visible emotional scar. Contradictory impulses act in the ritual setup and "I lied about you" peak. Ghost's brevity applies pressure without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ritual setup because generator crank therefore summoning, confession therefore metaphorical advice, dispersal therefore decision to write truth as Charged Poise RR with cost in "imperfect miracle... leaves its scar." Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perfume bottle and copper wire constrain ritual choices; jasmine recurs to charge Eleanor's form and final pocketing. Archive sheet music supplies closure image of Vera reading forgotten notes. Orchard hush outside tightens timeframe without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology) signaled early tightens via causal summoning success that forces confession trade-off, narrowing denial path with imperfect forgiveness cost legible in "wound that heals but leaves its scar." Agency in crank and outreach; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles theme emerges from ritual fragments, metaphors, and final "imperfect was enough" image reweighting gossip-to-truth arc without moralizing. Subtext in ghost's sync delay and orchard demise mirrors redemption's cost. Resonance inextricable from Vera's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (jasmine accuses nightly); voice rhythmic and biased toward supernatural grit. Dialogue subtextual ("gossip-column exorcist") distinguishes idiom; no head-hopping. Diction modulates with pressure at dispersal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glow with a light like dawn through dirty windows" advances sensory/prose/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Coherent metaphors ("river... stone") purposeful without muddle in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise synthesizes fresh angle on ghost story via copper ritual science; metaphors transform redemption trope organically. Risk in "induced currents" method heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from guilt anchor.</comment>
