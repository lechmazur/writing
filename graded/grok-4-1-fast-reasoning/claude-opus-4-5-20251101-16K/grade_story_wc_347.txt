<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's interior conflict shines in reluctance costing "warmth she couldn't spare," with micro-choices like precise placements revealing values; final endurance of curse earns stasis via prior causality, balancing competence with inevitable struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via curse patterns and descent to Charged Poise closure: travelers saved, Maren returns to burden, cost legible in "more of her warmth fed to something ancient and hungry."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth and birds constrain choices (pass only for her scent), nut/tool charge final image; sensory details (copper regret, brass ringing) filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal rot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide without binding curse) tightens at junction assembly, narrowing options before frost; agency in method endures with visible cost to self, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inherited burden emerges via nut's hope amid blight; final image of hands "smelling of the small nut's peculiar hope" reweights endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("mathematics of its madness"); rhythmic prose modulates gracefully, diction biased toward precise, cold beauty under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., short punches in descent); no loops, metaphors cohere (blade's loveliness), rhythm breathes with scene without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blueprint logic, nut memory, and bird patrols transforms curse trope; risk in anonymous precision heightens stakes organically.</comment>
