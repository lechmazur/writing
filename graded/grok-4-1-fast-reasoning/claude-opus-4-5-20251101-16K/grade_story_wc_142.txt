<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "Dual allegiance was a splinter in her heart, but she'd learned to work around pain," earning the endurance of painting despite Council role; micro-choices like orderly strokes under sway reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from heavier role to accelerated timeline tightening, landing Charged Poise closure in dawn mural/stone image reconfiguring options with allegiance cost felt in "splinter" callback.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Raft sway constrains orderly painting choice; foundation stone and neon veins charge final image, sensory hierarchy (motion, lights, calliope) filtered through Mira's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undermine privatization) signaled early, one accumulative tightening via "worse than usual" acceleration narrows options to urgent graffiti; agency in painting forecloses compliance path with dual-role cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory vs. corporate erasure emerges from stone/mural particulars, final "colors no developer could privatize" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in carnival-filtered noticing; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("Rocks don't remember"), rhythmic control modulates from sway-tension to poised dawn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm passes ear test; minor fig-lang density ("hope spreading through lungs") in peak painting beat subtracts slightly but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti resistance in floating carnival transforms gentrification trope; risk in dual-role allegiance heightens stakes organically, mural symbols inevitable from particulars.</comment>
