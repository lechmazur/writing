<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied in her instinct to "tie them back" clashing with the leaf-prompted pause; final call's directness ("I need help") earns closure via prior causal buildup of resisted admissions. Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds from leaf to vines to call, landing Charged Poise RR in phone dialogue with felt emotional cost ("I'm still afraid"). Orientation anchors immediately; single scene coherence perfect, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and clematis vines constrain observation/choice and charge final image ("vines already weaving new paths"); sensory details (dripping wood, glowing moss, misting rain) selectively POV-filtered through nursery expertise. Micro-setting evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist vs. embrace change) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via leaf/vines deepening knowledge; agency peaks in call's renunciation, foreclosing isolation with legible fear-cost. One meaningful pattern break suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from plant particulars (vines "exploring," linden survival) to resonant non-literal close ("leaf... carried forward"); no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "still afraid" without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (plant behaviors as language "underneath") biases noticing; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("I've been thinking... I need help"), advances plot with distinct voices. Rhythmic modulation heightens realization without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance image + character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor figurative density ("root system," "turning") purposeful under accumulative lens, not overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nursery expertise into reluctant epiphany via improbable linden leaf (husband tie subtle); transforms aging trope through plant particulars without template feel. Risky lyric close ("beautifully, necessarily undone") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
