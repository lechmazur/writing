<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely in "chest constriction" and "counting rungs," driving contradictory endurance versus panic in descent; final resolve earned by prior micro-choices like reading names aloud amid narrowing walls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from hatch to download, holding to Charged Poise closure in emergence "gasping, clutching the codex"; cost legible in "tide turning" tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal phases constrain download ("water reached her ankles") and charge final image ("ocean exhaled behind her"); sensory hierarchy (frost, hum, stains) filters through spelunker's bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tide as coherent pressure escalates via "detector screamed" and "crashing hush," forcing endurance agency; cost unmistakable in flooding return altering tactics to "worked faster."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of invisible traces emerges via cable hums and names, resonating in final "forgotten still spoke" without statement; reweights premise through endured descent particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tracks invisible things," "walls seemed to breathe") biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens pressure in short, propulsive tide sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "water stains marked the walls at chest height, and below them, frost clung"); minor wall-pressure echoes purposeful, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh codex-illuminations-to-cable-ghosts synthesis transforms explorer trope; claustrophobic dive risks heighten stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
