<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in Mira's fogged disbelief and hand closing on ampoule; final acceptance of nuance earned by revelation cascade with embodied grief cost. Caelum's compassion shown through patient telepathy, not labels. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density tightens from secret to ampoule threading to CR closure ("understanding without resolution") with conceptual cost of shattered certainties legible in final necklacing. Orientation anchored in opening statue extension. Single scene coherent, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Underwater garden constrains (pressure develops ampoule crack, filtered light tints violet) and charges final image (ocean preserves drowned, mirroring nuance). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Mira's regulator bubbles cascade revelations). Recurring corals/anemones evolve from dead to thriving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grandmother's truth) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening of contradictions narrowing certainty options; agency in Mira's taking ampoule forecloses innocence/guilt binaries with felt emotional cost. One tightening sufficient, charges Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuance emerges organically from particulars (poison/antidote duality, drowned/survived garden); final image reweights certainty premise non-literally without moralizing—"legacy threaded through... certainty until... truth." No Thematic Echo; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with clean telepathic intrusion (italics); distinct perceptual signature in Mira's embodied fog/diving bias. Rhythmic control modulates revelation intensity; no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short revelation bursts amid swaying descriptions), metaphors coherent (fissures for nuance). Propulsion peaks in "thread a thin chain... impossible, yet Mira watched," no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic statue threading cracked ampoule transforms drowned-city trope into nuance engine; risk-taking in animating stone heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via garden contradictions.</comment>
