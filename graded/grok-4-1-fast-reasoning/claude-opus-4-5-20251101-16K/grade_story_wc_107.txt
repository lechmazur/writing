<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in narration habit versus grief-fueled precision, earning the thaw realization; embodied in breath visible, flame roar, molten turn. Father's bookmark anchors traits without summary. Final micro-choice to tuck it reveals values hierarchy with cost of softening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to glass-shaping tightening, landing Charged Poise RR in "understood abandon differently now" with conceptual cost of grip release. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one meaningful cadence shift suffices. Closure image reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Control room's high ceilings and drips constrain glasswork space and mirror thaw; final "dripped and echoed... warming" charges image. Sensory hierarchy (groans, roar, bird) reflects Vera's priorities. Micro-setting (torch, silica) guides choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe zone amid thaw) deepens accumulatively via narration process, narrowing to abandon trade-off; agency in shaping forecloses frozen stasis. Cost felt in "dangerous and necessary" softening, charging final vessel. No reversal needed; textural escalation coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thaw/abandon theme emerges from glass vessel motif shifting to emotional release, resonant CR in "ice was melting. So, finally, was she" reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (bookmark, notebook) ground complexity; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narration's dramatic idiom ("glassblower prepares") creates distinct perceptual signature, modulating rhythm with intensity. Stable close third limited; elision of future wanderers primes charged poise payoff. Voice reflects thawing mind precisely.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action/image (e.g., "flame roaring blue"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative thread (silica bends) consistent, non-muddled. Final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-glacial glassblower synthesizing resilience/bookmark into safe-zone premise feels inevitable; transforms survival trope via inquiry vessels. Risky solo interiority heightens thaw stakes organically.</comment>
