<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in climax ("instinct was to guard... Instead, she made herself unbend"), earning change through embodied micro-choices with visible cost (unclenching seed).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: circles accumulate toward pulse and confession thaw (RR closure), with cost in vulnerability surge and seed planting; orientation anchored early ("cursed lake after the magic trick failed").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vortex branches lash and water tendrils constrain climax choice to unbend; final mirror image charges with purpose seen "not her face, but... wholeness," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inner truth) signaled early tightens texturally via confession vulnerability and surge attack; agency in unbend forecloses guarded path with legible cost (plants defense seed).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guard-as-fear vs. healing emerges implicitly from confession ("not as weapon. As healer") and final mirror repricing prior walls without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature ("warlike serenity... like armor forged from stillness"); rhythmic modulation peaks crisply in unbend sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "spine straightened... shoulders dropped... fist unclenched" varies rhythm without loops); no artifacts dull closure image of seed planted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes (vortex confession, unbend reversal) via guarded healer's arc; risk in soft surrender heightens stakes organically.</comment>
