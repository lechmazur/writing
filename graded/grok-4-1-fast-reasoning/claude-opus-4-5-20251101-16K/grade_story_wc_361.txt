<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between haste and pausing act vividly in the encounter; final planting choice earned by pendant's hum and mentor's memory, with cost in stilled hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying hum/aurora to CR closure; cost legible in "tiny green shoots, impossibly quick" reconfiguring time and presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora and ridgeway constrain stopping and charge final image of shoots; sensory details (violet light, silver light) filter through Mira's nervous perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of haste vs. presence tightens via pendant's sympathetic vibration forcing encounter; agency in planting forecloses rushing with felt time-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing wonder emerges organically from pausing and seeds; final image of shoots offers resonant reweighting of memory-to-myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature in trembling/noticing hum; dialogue subtextual ("nightroot" cues mentor), rhythmic prose modulates intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figures like "time seemed to stretch like honey" propel without muddle in peak planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrating pendant extending moments transforms mentor trope; risk in mythic fade-to-myth inevitable via germinating seeds.</comment>
