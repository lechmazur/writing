<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's eccentricity manifests concretely through her gap-observing method and psychometry gift, driving micro-choices like drawer-search; final endurance in secret-keeping forecloses disclosure with emotional cost of borrowed grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via impressionistic revelations to CR closure: pinning boutonniere reweights mystery premise with conceptual cost of outlasted love, legible in "hold it for them both"; orientation anchored early, lens holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal dock's pearlescent shimmer and mist constrain ritual investigation and mirror internal absences; nautical twilight narrows perception, charging final beam-swept mist image as resonant reconfigurations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding mystery deepens accumulatively through borrowed memories, narrowing to stance of silent witness; cost felt in isolation's persistence, though agency leans reflective over decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of truths in absences emerges organically from gaps, flower, photo; final drawer closure offers non-literal resonance on persistent love's cost without moralizing, reweighting prior observations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with Maren's perceptual signature (salt-thick air, gradients) modulates rhythmically under reflective pressure; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression pays off in memory shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid, integrated sensory propulsion; rhythmic variety peaks in memory whispers, no loops or artifacts, though minor fever-dream metaphor strains slightly without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry synthesis via Edelweiss transforms lighthouse trope into memory-crucible; risk in quiet CR heightens isolation stakes, inevitable in hindsight from gap method.</comment>
