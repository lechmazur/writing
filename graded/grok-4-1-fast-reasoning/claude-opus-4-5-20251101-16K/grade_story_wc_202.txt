<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories roots consistently in grandmother's gift and intensifies through lens use, compelling the pivotal unfastening. Interiority concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like pressing lens revealing values under pressure. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene limits 9+; reflective summaries slightly abstract emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market entry to lens revelation, culminating in CR closure where "past and present collapsed into an eternal instant" reconfigures time with conceptual cost of deliberate forgetting. Orientation anchored early in market and Mira's role. One tightening via painting unveiling suffices; lens ambiguity absent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (turpentine smell, swaying cables) filter through Mira's translator bias, constraining focus on hidden details. Lighthouse lens as micro-setting charges final image, pulsing warmly. Environment mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent in stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revealing obscured histories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lens peering into "figures in the waves," narrowing to unfastening with felt cost of historical erasure. Agency in delicate peeling forces stance crystallization. Enters 8+ via trade-off but minor abstractness in stakes legibility prevents higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of histories in margins emerges implicitly from lens unfastening and journal copying, with final "ropes creaked like the rigging of ships long gone" offering resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in contrasts (city forgetting vs market remembering) invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (realms "overlapped like transparencies"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to charged in "eternal instant." Prose texture lyrical and biased to hidden details. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "The piece was elusively tangible, solid when she focused... slips toward transparency"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful motifs avoid overwriting. Zero figurative muddle in peak unfastening beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (translator via paintings) transforms tropes organically, with "unfasten what had been hidden" as bold inflection growing from particulars. Risk-taking in nonlinear time collapse heightens stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
