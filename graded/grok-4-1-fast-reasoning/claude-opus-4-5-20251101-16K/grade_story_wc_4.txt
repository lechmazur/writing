<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's traits shine in concrete actions like tracing arcs and placing the new photo, rooted in consistent motivation; lacks embodied contradictory impulses or pressure-tested micro-choices acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered photo connections culminating in CR ('placed both photographs side by side...smiled at the symmetry'), reweighting grief to shared art with conceptual cost of enduring ruins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted factory, vines, and lavender field constrain patient archive work and charge final image ('vines continued their patient climb...lavender swayed'), filtered through Mira's arc-seeing perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transmuting pain signaled early tightens accumulatively through gesture rhymes to new photo symmetry, Mira's agency in placement foreclosing isolation with felt cost of persistent grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shared arcs emerge organically from photo particulars; final hand-raise match ('arc...matched perfectly') resonates as non-literal answer to collective connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ('grammar of joy and sorrow') stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control heightens closure poise without elision slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively ('arcs...rhymed across time'); purposeful arc/vine motifs integrate without loops, muddle, or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arcs as emotional 'grammar' ingeniously synthesizes decay/renewal, transforming tropes via specific photo method; risk of lyric vignette heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
