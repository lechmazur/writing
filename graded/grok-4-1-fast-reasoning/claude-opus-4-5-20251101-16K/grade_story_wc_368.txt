<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yuki's dye-master observation ties to heart's magnetism, with embodied chest-tightening showing contradictory recognition-love without memory; final resolve to tell her story feels earned via prior causality, foreclosing silence with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to wing's light-projection CR, reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost in "dreams pressed into... light itself"; orientation anchored early in ladder-climb, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating tea house's chains, mist, window-crystal constrain illumination choice and charge final fade; wing as micro-setting mirrors internal states through tactile handling, filtering via dye-master bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnetism source) signaled early, tightens via old woman's explanation then light-deepening that narrows Yuki's options from confusion to reconfiguration; protagonist agency in lifting wing forces felt cost of borrowed stories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Iridescent caution emerges organically via wing's structural color paralleling heart's unspoken dreams; final image of shifting blue offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting "some beauty... in motion" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (light/color shifts) stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual ("magnetism") advances stakes naturally, modulating rhythm under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm in light-rivers imagery; no loops or artifacts, purposeful figurative layering taught early fits accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Donor-heart magnetism plus structural-color projection transforms trope into fresh synthesis; wing's payoff feels inevitable from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes cleanly.</comment>
