<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's fluidly logical precision and method reveal character through actions like monitoring the glass and guiding dialogue, earning the man's shift; man's grief embodied in jaw tightness and noise spikes shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final unclenching and glass clearing stem from prior causality with emotional cost. Minor slip: man's wife mention verges on summary but anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds via glass shifts and dialogue to Charged Poise closure where glass clears ("crystalline and clear") and man carries "first quiet," reconfiguring silence with felt emotional cost. Single scene oriented early (Mira's role by para 2). No orientation debt; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains choices (navigating rotating platforms, spires) and charges closure via light painting emotional shifts; storm glass as micro-setting mirrors internal states tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (Mira notes noise frequencies, prismatic hums). Final image of drifting terrace recharges light/silence motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (man's corrosive rumination vs. silence comfort) signaled early via glass clouding; accumulative deepening through glass filaments upward and dialogue narrows to stance crystallization with cost in shoulders releasing. Agency in Mira's catalyzing, man's availability to quiet. One tightening sufficient, charges final nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "presence—space that holds" emerges organically from echo, glass, transit; final line ("noise stops arguing with silence") offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in unclenched hands, feathered crystals. No sermonizing; ambiguity in ongoing "education" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Mira with perceptual signature (noise frequencies, glass patterns); voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive hush to precise dialogue. Dialogue subtextual ("You don't need to explain"), goal-driven, distinct (man's terse vs. Mira's measured). No head-hopping; diction fits gondola operator's attuned lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/action/emotion (e.g., "crystals inside would feather and dissolve"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (light "ribbons," "pooled like water") without muddle in peaks. Closure image crisp, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism terrace/storm glass synthesize emotional barometer in transit frame organically; transforms grief trope via specific logic (noise vs. silence frequencies). Risk in lyric hush heightens stakes without gimmick; fresh angle on catharsis feels inevitable in glass clearing.</comment>
