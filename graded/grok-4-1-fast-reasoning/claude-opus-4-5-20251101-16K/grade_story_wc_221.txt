<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied from outset (palm on viewport), with contradictory paralysis shifting via micro-choices in sketching; final renunciation of stasis earned by pattern accumulation, no unearned epiphanies. Blind spots in fixed expectations drive the glimpse beat productively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sketch density builds to pattern break ("north star moved like a heartbeat"), yielding Charged Poise closure where Mira flows through time; cost legible in "refusal to drift entirely into the stretching void."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via dilation-smeared stars forcing memory sketches, constraining all choices; recurring viewport/journal charge final image ("light continued its slow dance"), mirroring internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome temporal paralysis) signaled early, deepens via glimpse reversal narrowing to navigation choice; agency in hopeful sketching forecloses passivity with felt cost of eternal paradox.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of motion-as-home emerges organically from sketch evolution and compass touch, reweighting Polaris drift; final image ("drawing... constellations of hope") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (time as "spilled mercury," "smeared suggestions"); rhythmic modulation builds from stretched silence to potential hum, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images (stars "blur into threads"); varied syntax/rhythm peaks at realization without loops or muddled metaphors, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dilation isolation with generational sketches revealing mobile north; risk in lyric accumulative drive transforms sci-fi trope into inevitable conceptual shift.</comment>
