<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional: Elena's calcified bitterness embodied when arrowhead points at her chest, forcing contradictory impulses (prove colleagues wrong vs. thaw into wonder); earned renunciation forecloses Institute career with explicit cost on final page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density of garden phenomena building to closure CR (bitterness thaws via arrowhead return); anchors who/where/when by para 2; cost legible in "Institute would call her a failure... career would end in disgrace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (ceiling-soil roots, hovering oceans) constrains choices (roots reach as fingers) and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (frozen mint, crystallizing breath) reflects scientific POV bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document/weaponize vs. join harmony) signaled early, tightens via phone confessions and arrowhead vibration narrowing options; agency in returning arrowhead crystallizes stance with career cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness as cosmic joke emerges organically from Margit's confession and Elena's parallel thaw; resonant CR ending ("smiling at the cosmic joke") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (scientific ache at physics defiance); rhythmic modulation peaks in "roots unwound... harmony untamed"; phone voices carry subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied syntax (short punchy realizations amid descriptive cadence); no loops/artifacts; opening "frostbitten stalks" motif recharges via thawing bitterness in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-garden defying physics into untamed harmony; risk-taking in backward-growing bitterness transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via arrowhead seal moment.</comment>
