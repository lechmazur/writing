<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's resilient positivity creates contradictory impulses—fear expected but wonder dominates—embodied in "heart should have been racing... felt something else: wonder," compelling the merger choice with earned cost via prior job love.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: vanishing incites, radio to selves tightens via patterns, closure DC in "chose arrival" with cost legible in dissolving grotto and filled hourglass; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's crystalline walls constrain choice by revealing patterns for merger; sensory glow/starlight selective via Marcus's ferry lens, charges final image as it dissolves into harbor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end loop) signaled early, causal tightening via radio shift narrows options with agency; cost unmistakable in foreclosing transient state for arrival, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of routine love transcending fracture emerges via ferry knowledge merging timelines; final "permanent transient... chose arrival" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ferry routes as patterns); woman's dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via exposition that prompts action; rhythm modulates pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels from "slipped between frequencies" to "hourglass sat... warm and waiting"; metaphors coherent, no overwriting in peak merger beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry routine into timeline patterns feels inevitable; risky "time sideways"/grotto surrealism heightens stakes via Marcus's occupational lens without gimmick.</comment>
