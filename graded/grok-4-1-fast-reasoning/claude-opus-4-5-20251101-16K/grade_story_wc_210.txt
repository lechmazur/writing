<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied strain of "pushed past nine, past twenty, past a hundred" reveals contradictory resolve against nostalgia, earning final conception with solitude cost; interiority particular to alchemist training.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density culminates in bottle's glow and revival (CR/RR), reweighting wishes vs. will with legible cost of empty streets; orientation anchored in opening harbor image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bottle as micro-setting constrains via failed openings then warms to catalyze revival, charging final image; lanterns recur from faded to glowing, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of non-wish revival tightens accumulatively through memory overload, forcing trade-off in "strained under the weight"; agency in refusal forecloses easy path with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-blueprint emerges implicitly via bottle activation, final image of letters reweighting heritage without moral; resonance from particulars like grandmother's lanterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual bias toward alchemical patterns ("architecture," "blueprint"); rhythmic modulation peaks in memory strain, prose texture distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "Stone by stone... Person by person" propelling escalation; varied rhythm, no loops dull closure's honey-poured light image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of working memory limits reviving ghost town transforms trope of magic depletion; risk in conceptual climax ("memory becoming matter") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
