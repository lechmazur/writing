<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied rituals like turning the key and counting backwards; final realization earned by prior meditation practice without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses (forward calibration vs. backward counting) act in scene, compelling higher-stakes vigil. Minor reflection reliance anchored tightly to present cues like the key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from calibration to counting to CR closure ("At zero, she understood") with conceptual cost legible in final vigil image. Orientation anchored early (station, Edris, evening post-whistle). Single scene coherent, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Horizon "razor edges" and hydraulic gurgles constrain observation and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (visual geometries, fjord quiet) reflects POV priorities. Micro-setting (clocks, key) mirrors internal severance. No generic placeholders; all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding clocks) signaled early, escalates via density increase in backward counting that reweights knowledge under Accumulative lens. Agency in meditative endurance forecloses forward-rush path with felt cost of time's "violence." Quiet but coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time as severance) emerges organically from particulars like water trickling and horizon line; final image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Returning "razor" motif shifts meaning, reweighting premise. No tidy binaries or statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature in clock/hydraulic metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from contemplative to charged vigil. Prose texture reflects shepherd's mind, selective noticing (violet thread, gurgles). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "water trickling through channels carved when her great-grandfather was young"). Varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; purposeful "razor" recurrence taught early. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic clocks as time-shepherding monastery transforms time trope into "amputation" insight; bold lyric risk (backward counting) heightens stakes inevitably. No templates; premise commits fully to peculiar edge-world.</comment>
