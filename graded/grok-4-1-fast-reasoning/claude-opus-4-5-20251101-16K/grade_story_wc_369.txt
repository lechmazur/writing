<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in scarred hands regenerating under moonlight, embodying her endurance; final realization earned by decades of sweeping, with ongoing cost of rescarring. Contradictory competence-struggle balance compels transformation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sweeping grief to sextant roots-vision CR, with legible cost in eternal cycle ("hands would scar again"). Pin-drop moment tightens to closure without causal break; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlight as micro-setting constrains healing and enables precision work, charging final descent image; storm/tower details selectively mirror internal shift from maintenance to gardening. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access tree-witness via transformed sextant) signaled early, deepens via dream-mapping to roots-revelation under accumulative lens; agency in deconstruction forecloses ignorance with cycle-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-nutrient emerges implicitly from dust-seed image shift, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; final "mundane miracle" line offers non-literal answer to sorrow's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (measuring grief by dust/shimmer) modulates rhythmically; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to pin-ring closure; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (e.g., "loss like pollen") without muddle in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow/trees-as-gardeners transforms tropes organically; risk in inward sextant pivot feels inevitable, heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
