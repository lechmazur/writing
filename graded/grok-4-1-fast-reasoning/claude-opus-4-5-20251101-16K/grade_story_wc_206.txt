<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation rooted in daughter's hollow laugh and decades of repairs compels the tethering sacrifice; contradictory impulses peak when "his own light beginning to flow." Earned change via prior causality; midnight's pressure reveals character limits without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: stone wilts → detects lie → confronts midnight → tethers light for DC closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "exhausted, diminished in some small way."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's "walls singing with frequencies beyond hearing" constrains tethering and charges climax; brass gears and crystalline cylinders filter through tinker's bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis; details evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim stolen wonder) tightens via causal reversal: wilting stone forces confrontation, narrowing to sacrificial agency. Cost unmistakable in light flow from "every music box he'd ever touched"; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of free-giving defying theft emerges via covenant renewal; final "melody like sunrise, like his daughter's laugh" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in shadow-smile and tether charges resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tinker's perceptual signature (magic in "tiny turning gears"); voice modulates rhythm under stress. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("The covenant holds"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (wilting petal, shadow-smile). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "light poured through the chip, through the box."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher's stone as mender of absences and "covenant of rust"; transforms entropy tropes via tinkersong defiance. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
