<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to embrace estrangement as connection's vessel is embodied in her nameless listening and disc-playing, with endurance of isolation earning closure. Contradictory impulses surface in choosing underground life deliberately yet syncing disc to heartbeat. Interiority concrete via "loops... her specialty," avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: call density builds chorus of grief, tightening to Vera's purpose with Charged Poise closure—"she had chosen estrangement... purest vessel"—reconfiguring loops as doors with estrangement's cost felt. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's "cables hung like sleeping serpents" and copper air constrain isolation, mirroring internal loops; glass disc as micro-setting charges final heartbeat sync. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (harmonica frequencies of longing). No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching endings to begin—tightens accumulatively via girl then man calls, narrowing to renunciation of surface life with cost in "faceless, existing only in the spaces between." Agency in disc use forecloses escape path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loops as doors emerges implicitly from calls and disc tone shifting "endings... [to] begin"; final image reweights estrangement without moralizing—"prayer for all the endings waiting to become something new."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in haunted frequencies and booth hums; voice rhythmic, modulating from descriptive to charged ("tone spiraling upward"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("She's not here... I can listen").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax accelerates from setup to peak calls; purposeful "loop" recurrence taught early without churn. No artifacts; final line image propels with propulsion—"its vibration sync with her heartbeat."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wrong-number grief operator and glass harmonica transforms isolation trope; risk in melodically haunted tunnel pays off at closure heartbeat sync, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
