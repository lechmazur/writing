<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied breath shifts and palm on jade releasing chest knot; skeptical curiosity drives micro-choices like camera setup under fading light. Contradictory impulses (spiritual pull vs. doubt) act simultaneously, earning release without therapy-speak. Final realization confronts withheld love's cost through prior memory anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from memory cue to inverted vision shift (wisteria pulsing), delivering CR closure in "the wisteria had inherited everything" with emotional cost felt in knot release. Orientation anchors early (viaduct, three days post-memory). Single scene tightens once meaningfully via breath-to-vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (wisteria/jasmine knots, dying light through blooms) filter via artist's inverted gaze, constraining camera placement and charging final shimmer in petals. Body as micro-setting: breath/chest tie to jade evolution. No white-room; spatial coherence on viaduct edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signals early, tightens via breath change narrowing perception to luminous residue, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in sustained attention forecloses grief path with palpable chest release cost. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of deferred tenderness emerges organically via camera inversion and bloom-vessels image, reweighting premise in final "garden" realization without moralizing. Subtext in jade warmth echoes grandmother's lore through struggle. Resonant non-literal close: shimmer as accumulated devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (worlds "invert" for clarity); rhythmic modulation peaks in vision shift ("wisteria fell upward"). Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or filter excess. Voice particular to artist's foggy lucidity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory propulsion (e.g., "blossoms seemed to pulse") without loops or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies for breath cadence. Minor figurative density in peak vision beat purposeful, not overwriting. Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pinhole artist's inverted sight reveals love in blooms, transforming past-life trope via Kwan Yin jade and sparks pilgrimage. Risky lyric Accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes; irreplaceable camera/jade logic feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
