<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied reactions like gripping the ladder against wind shove; motivation rooted in competence drives micro-choices to climb despite known risks. Final renunciation of negligence for physics earns closure with irony of Webb's expertise via patch. Contradictory impulses—caution vs. precision—act simultaneously at the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via measurements building density to CR closure: final image reprices system as killer with conceptual cost of unseen currents persisting. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening at convergence discovery holds without ambiguity. Cost legible in "wind still moved... waiting for the next singular convergence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Containers as labyrinth constrain climb and charge final dawn image; wind's moan and pulses tactilely mirror internal realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects investigator bias: anemometer readings over visuals. Micro-setting (ladders, seams) guides choices without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove wind/physics via survey) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at funnel convergence narrowing negligence option. Agency in climbing/measuring forecloses path with felt cost of Webb's irony. Pressure coheres to charged poise: her report vs. port's metabolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of foresight vs. optimization emerges organically from funnel/patch particulars, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Final image answers "universe demands foresight" with resonant ambiguity: wind waits, but "someone would be watching." Subtext in irony of competent dead avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: wind as "invisible rivers," precise lexicon matching investigator. Rhythmic modulation accelerates in climb, breathes in reflection. No elision; diction biases toward physics over emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "corrugated steel walls rising forty feet"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Specifics like "seven knots from the northwest" replace generics; no figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms port accident into wind-physics inquiry; containers-as-funnel ingenuity inevitable from setup. Risk in unconventional survey method heightens stakes organically, synthesizing occupational detail with thematic irony.</comment>
