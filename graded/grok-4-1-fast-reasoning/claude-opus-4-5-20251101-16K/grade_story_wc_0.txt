<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when dust halts her "process" intent, earning final call with embodied cost ("voice cracked"); astrophysicist's preprocessing flaw drives inevitable emotional confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to CR closure via dust realization and phone call; cost legible in "preprocessing finally failing," reconfiguring emotional avoidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse wreckage (warped benches, silted dust) constrains navigation and charges epiphany image; POV-filtered through stellar decay lens anchors specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional preprocessing tightens at butterfly dust discovery, forcing renunciation via call; agency crystallizes humility under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gradual decay theme emerges organically from star/butterfly/mother parallels, resonant CR in final "universe compress" image reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with astrophysicist perceptual signature (equations filtering reality); rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure to call.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density fuses image/action (dust "shimmered faintly"); propulsion peaks seamlessly in closure call.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star physics and butterfly dust transforms epiphany on personal decay; risk in metaphorical depth inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
