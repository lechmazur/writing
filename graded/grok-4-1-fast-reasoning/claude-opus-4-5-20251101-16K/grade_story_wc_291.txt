<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in prosopagnosia, with contradictory impulses (face-blindness vs. essence-seeing) acting simultaneously in painting choices; micro-decisions like starting with negative shapes earn the final portrait's empathetic charge. "Where others saw features, Elena perceived something beneath" reveals character-particular perception without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as painting density builds from absence to Maya’s emergent portrait, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("the portrait, at least, would speak") with legible emotional cost ("It would hurt. Empathy always did."). Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via mist evolution suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry's mist and shadows constrain painting method and mirror internal process, evolving causally (thickens then lifts) to charge final image; POV-filtered sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency. "The mist clung to the water's surface forty feet below" grounds spatial choreography and charges closure contrast with portrait.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening as portrait unifies opposites, narrowing to Charged Poise with unmistakable cost in anticipated grief reopening; agency in methodical endurance forecloses forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy piercing numbness emerges organically from painting particulars and motif shifts (ribbon/mask from absence to presence); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("portrait... would speak" vs. "water kept its secrets") reweighting cold case premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing postures/loss angles over faces); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed concentration to poised resolution, prose-as-character reflecting methodical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm, and purposeful figurative integration (e.g., "granite walls rose like cathedral buttresses"); zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion accelerates with painting beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious premise transforms cold case trope via face-blind artist's essence-painting, with fresh synthesis of prosopagnosia and empathy stakes feeling inevitable; risk in abstract process heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
