<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via grief-embodied micro-choices like holding the bronze foot during calls; contradictory impulses (staying as "another kind of dying") earn the final reconfiguration of purpose. Elena's call forces a personal navigation that reveals Mira's blind spots and values hierarchy without safety-hedging. Voice particular to widowed navigator.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of calls and maps builds to Charged Poise closure where air shifts and bronze warms, reconfiguring loss with felt emotional cost ("almost like peace in the wreckage"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Signal Station Twelve, post-hydraulics); no disorientation debt. Single-shard fits Track A with legible closure cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's dishes and gantries constrain navigation (drink frequencies on dark moons), charging final image ("starlit towers" as Elena's landmark). Bronze foot as micro-setting anchors choices and mirrors fragmentation. Sensory hierarchy (starlight, static crackles) reflects Mira's grief bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide reverse migrations) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via escalating calls to Elena's voice, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in charting via memory landmarks forecloses wandering with relational cost (warmth/breath beside her). One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of building from fragments emerges organically via patchwork maps and censer foot, resonant in final image ("fragments can still be precious") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in reverse migration lingers via ambiguity (wind or Elena?). Protagonist arc inextricable from geography of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with grief-modulated diction ("grief-sharpened instincts"); perceptual signature in frequency/loss metaphors. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell me what you see"), advances plot via goal pursuit. Rhythmic control peaks in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy calls amid lyrical builds); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull propulsion. Figurative language purposeful in accumulative mode (e.g., "light too loud"). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio ghost story via "patchwork navigator" charting grief-geography transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure without gimmickry; irreplaceable premise heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
