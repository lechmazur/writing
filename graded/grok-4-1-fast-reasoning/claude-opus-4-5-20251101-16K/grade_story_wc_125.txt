<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior conflict peaks authentically when she touches the rope during the choice, embodying prior escape as contradictory impulse toward severance with visible human cost. Traits like ethical playfulness act in-scene via her laugh and exchange observation. Final acceptance earned by layered causality without epiphanic shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations layer to CR closure where "Show me" reconfigures time experience with cost ("bridges belong fully to neither shore"). Orientation anchored early in grotto descent; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto constrains descent (rope heavy) and charges final image ("warm as terra-cotta"), mirroring internal texture. Sensory selectivity (warm clay, starlight, bent light) filters through Mira's poetic bias, evolving with revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, escalates via layered peelings that force trade-off choice under Accumulative lens. Agency in "Show me" forecloses human time with on-page cost; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of exchange/surrender emerges organically via rope-choice parallel, reweighted in final image of holding pre-choice moment without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: poetry becomes "language of duration."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with poetic perceptual signature (time as taffy/strata); dialogue sparse but subtext-rich ("reading me" echoes). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at "quietest surrenders."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (onion/geological layers) without muddle, propelling to closure. Varied syntax accelerates revelations, breathes in choice pause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: poet navigates energy beings' time-layers via escape-rope ethic, risking bold conceptual drift. Rope's transformation from severance reminder to texture anchor feels inevitable.</comment>
