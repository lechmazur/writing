<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in resentment-to-understanding arc of father's words, embodied via seashell handling; final writing choice earned by prior visitations with visible cost of endless search. Contradictory impulses act in resisting current amid dissolving hopes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cameo density builds to younger self's touch, cadence shifts to notebook writing as CR with conceptual cost of no center (shell's new fracture). Orientation anchored early at crossroads; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Seashell as micro-setting constrains choice (grows warm, fractures) and charges final image; mist's "swirling hush" sensory hierarchy reflects watchful urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect hopes against current) signaled early, deepens via cameos to stance crystallization in writing; cost unmistakable in "keep going deeper" realization, reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of searching-as-story emerges implicitly from cameos and shell's spiral; final image ("new fracture line...keep going deeper") offers resonant CR without moral, reweighting premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cataloguing hope shapes); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to silence, heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short cameo sentences propel, longer reflections breathe); figurative language purposeful (mist as "breath held between worlds") without muddle in peak visitations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal nexus as hopes' crossroads transforms writer-block trope; risk of abstract cameos grounded in tactile shell and irreplaceable final fracture heightens stakes organically.</comment>
