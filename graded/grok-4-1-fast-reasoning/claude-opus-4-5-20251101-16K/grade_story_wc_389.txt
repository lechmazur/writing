<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to shape a new dawn roots consistently in traits like solitude and prophecy-listening, compelling her broadcast shift and descent with felt cost. Interiority feels embodied in laughs and storm-washed moments, revealing flaws like control illusions without tidy epiphanies. Minor slip: faction argument summarizes external pressure without her micro-choice reaction on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to faction confusion via prophecy whispers, tightening to raw static broadcast that reconfigures allegiance. Closure as CR lands on-page in descent and blue fire image, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of lost control ("it will remember your frequency"). Orientation anchors early; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and cobalt glass constrain choices (altar rituals, final walk) and charge closure image, scattering "blue fire across the clouds." Sensory hierarchy filters via Mira's prophetic bias; vivid, purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (radio, glass) evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn vs. faction calcification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pilgrim arrival and argument, deepening through raw static that unites confusion and forecloses control. Agency in broadcast pivot narrows options with cost (isolation erodes). Climax faction dispute tests but resolves off-page slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "being heard across the noise" emerges organically from static voices, factions, and final descent without statement. Resonant CR reweights prophecy as relinquishment, inviting ambiguity on control via blue light image. Particulars like fragmented frequencies charge emotional aftereffect; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature: prophetic lyricism biases noticing (static as "lyrically prophetic"). Voice texture modulates gritty whimsy rhythmically, distinct in prophecy phrasings; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; diction fits solitary visionary lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines; purposeful metaphors (e.g., "rusted needle through gray silk") cohere without muddle in peak broadcast shift. Minor paraphrase loops in storm motifs, but pattern-taught and closure-charging. Clean grammar; opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio static as ancient shadows/prophecy transforms prophet trope via gritty whimsy and faction "variant allegiance." Risky accumulative compression of 17 years heightens stakes organically; cobalt glass reprise inevitable in hindsight, committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
