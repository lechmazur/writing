<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory impulses (mechanical duties vs. internal burn) act simultaneously, embodied in voice cracking on forbidden poem; final writing choice earned by envelope discovery with cost of potential Ministry reprisal. No label-only flaws; flaws (compliance mask) complicate and propel closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from storm vigil to envelope find, pattern break in reading aloud, cadence shift to writing as RR/Charged Poise; cost legible in "small defiance against the black marks" and endless timer resets foreclosing silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rarefied air and observatory glass constrain mask-slip reflection and sharpen thoughts, charging closure stars/storm quiet; selective sensory (violet sheets, thunder bass) mirrors internal scars without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim voice vs. erasure) signaled early, deepens via envelope to on-page endurance of poetry; one tightening (reading aloud amid storm response) narrows to writing with felt defiance cost, though stakes slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars' atlas emerges from poem architecture and vigil shift; final "scars will have their atlas" image resonantly reconfigures censorship premise without moral, inviting ambiguity of hand-to-hand dissemination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (topographical soul, lightning searching); rhythmic modulation peaks in "multiple Elenas overlapping," diction controlled and lyrical without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from pause to purpose; no loops/artifacts, figurative coherent (lightning walks like searching), read-aloud rhythm breathes with storm cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars cartography, timetable envelope, furiously tranquil vigil transforms exile trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Mira's hidden gift.</comment>
