<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera's steadily curious trait compels patient mapping and final notation endurance with visible cost of incomplete unlocking; Marcus's belief-loss motivation drives coherent pressure. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses; traits shown through micro-choices like tracing tape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in Vera's notation addition, reconfiguring possibilities with conceptual cost of unfinished decoding; orientation anchored early, lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skylight and measuring tape as micro-settings constrain solitary work and charge final image; details like onyx ink's angle-shifts selectively filter Vera's pattern-focused perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pattern-mapping tightens accumulatively via Marcus's reverse-engineering question, narrowing to admission and conceptual cost in ongoing unraveling; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-built traps emerges organically from cards, tape, and spreads; final city-breathing image resonantly reweights collective paths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature in noticing ink depths and pattern densities; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices via Marcus's directness vs. Vera's explanatory poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful metaphors like "drink the luminescence" enhance without muddle or loops, even in peak explanatory beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crash divination and cultural metrics transforms tropes via tape's date-densities; risk in abstract-pattern cartomancy heightens stakes organically.</comment>
