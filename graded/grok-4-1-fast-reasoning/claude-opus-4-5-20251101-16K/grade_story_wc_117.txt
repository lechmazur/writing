<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's adaptive traits drive micro-choices like kalimba timing and curl reveal, earning Marcus's breakthrough; interiority embodied in "throat tightened" amid tempered hope. Marcus revealed particular through curiosity and crescents, not stereotypes. Minor therapy-speak in reflection slightly abstracts peak emotion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to totality's Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring silence with legible cost in "not healed... but opened." Orientation anchored early (therapist, boy, ridge, eclipse timer). Single scene, one tightening at eclipse suffices; curl pays off prior carry motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sage, eclipse corona, crescent shadows, kalimba constrain choices (glasses handed, crouched touch) and charge closure image (curl silhouetted). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (scent sharpens as temp drops). No white-room; evolved details (birds quiet, crickets early) mirror internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break silence via wonder) signaled early, textural escalation via eclipse progression narrows to totality's agency (kalimba stops, curl given). Cost felt in 91-day silence foreclosed path, tempered by "far they still had to walk." One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges via eclipse particulars, curl linking loss/wonder; final image ("curl... against chest") reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in silence, shared hush avoids moralizing. Complexity in cautious hope resists tidy cure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd Elena perceptual signature (rhythmic attunement: "sound meeting moment"); diction modulates to terse totality silence. Sparse dialogue natural/childlike ("My mom..."), goal-driven. No head-hopping; rhythm heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short totality breaths amid flowing ascent); no loops/artifacts, precise verbs ("crouched," "unwrapped"). Propulsion syncs scene: soft kalimba notes decelerate to charged hush. Zero scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse therapy + heirloom curl transforms grief trope via textural magic. Quiet risk in non-dramatic closure heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; ridge eclipse feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
