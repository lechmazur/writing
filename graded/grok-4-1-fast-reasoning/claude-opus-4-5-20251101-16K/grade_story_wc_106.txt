<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as thief-for-profit vs. guardian crystallize in final planning beat, earned by causal chain of discoveries; embodied reactions like trembling hands ground interiority without clichés. Final renunciation of profit motive forecloses prior path with felt cost. Single-POV voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: portrait discovery -> moonbeam reveal -> prophecy realization tightens to CR closure where Mira reweights premise (portraits as warnings), with undeniable conceptual cost in shifted purpose; on-page in "She had to reinterpret everything" and final seal/planning. Orientation anchored early at station; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jar constrains reinterpretation choice and charges final image ("sealed the jar"); station/fields/moonlight selectively mirror internal shift from gold to silver light, integrated via action. Sensory hierarchy (light tasted, hummed) POV-biased to savvy thief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding destinies) signaled early via whispers/codes, escalates via agency-driven moonbeam use narrowing options (profit vs. guardianship); cost legible in foreclosed thief path and "visible cost on the page" via politician's assassination warning. One tightening sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (portraits capture prophecies, destiny caught like light) emerges via shifting images (amber face -> text), resonant CR in mother's message reweighting priors without moral; final line non-literal answer to "pressing your ear against destiny’s door."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalized through light-obsessed perceptual signature ("light became something you could almost taste"); rhythmic modulation builds pressure, elision of backstory cued concretely (grandmother's codes) and paid in reinterpret beat. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonbeams hummed against her hip" advances prop/atmosphere); varied rhythm, purposeful light metaphors consistent without muddle or loops in peak reveals. Zero scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of portrait-theft and light-prophecy transforms tropes organically; risk in elliptical CR closure heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early whispers to "scream warnings."</comment>
