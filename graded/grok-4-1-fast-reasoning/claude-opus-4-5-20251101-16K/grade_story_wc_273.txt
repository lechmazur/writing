<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory serene anger embodied in "calcified into something permanent and patient," compels micro-choices like pouring ink; realization of brother's fate earns final resolve with self-sacrifice cost, satisfying 9+ test without slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ink patterns densify to CR closure—"Vera understood then"—repricing time's folds with legible cost of endless climb; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sandstone pillars' "frozen screams" mirror internal kinship, constrain isolation for unhindered pursuit; wind and stars charge final image, satisfying 9+ test via environmental constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time in crisis) signaled early, deepens via Marcus vision narrowing to rescue tactic; accumulative pressure culminates in self-disappearance trade-off, legible cost in "climbing alongside him forever."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's hidden layers emerges organically from ink glimpses and brother's fall; final stars' "ancient light" offers resonant CR repricing without moral, reweighting premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern observations like "ephemeral blueprints"; rhythmic control heightens via short commands amid lyric swells, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives like "molten glass" integrated sans muddle; varied rhythm propels to closure image, zero loops or scaffolds obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ink-as-portal transforms time-dilation trope into brother-trapped specificity; risk of perceptual CR feels inevitable from patterns, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
