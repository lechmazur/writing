<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism shines in embodied actions like forehead kisses recalled and her deliberate somatic choices under pressure; contradictory faith in neuroscience vs. love's "telepathy" acts simultaneously to earn Eli's response. Eli's minimal but pivotal hand-to-chest and whisper reveal character through reaction. Final reconnection costs ongoing work, foreclosing disconnection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from geode setup through layered light-painting beats to Charged Poise closure at "I felt it" and forehead press, reconfiguring isolation with cost of persistent effort ("We'll do it again"). Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt. Motivated ellipsis via somatic history pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Studio's darkness, LED wand, and geode constrain choices, narrowing to prismatic light trails that enable climax; artist's POV filters details fractally (e.g., "arc of her arm when she'd first waved"). Final rainbows charge image, mirroring internal reconnection. Sensory focus on light/motion integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of somatic reconnection signaled early tightens accumulatively via Eli's hand-to-chest amid painting, forcing endurance; agency in Maya's motions forecloses verbal paths with cost of iteration. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise where recognition reweights disconnection. No coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of embodied love as telepathy emerges from particulars like geode fractals and somatic arcs, culminating in non-literal resonance of scattered rainbows as "promises" without statement. Subtext in skepticism fueling action invites ambiguity on miracles vs. neuroscience. Final image reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Maya POV with perceptual signature (light fractals, structured patterns) modulates rhythmically under intensity; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("I'm going to try something"). Lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure image. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from setup to peak painting; figurative fractals purposeful without muddle in climax ("each ray splitting and splitting again"). Minor density risks in reflective opener offset by payoff; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy recall, somatic light-painting, and geode optics transforms tropes into inevitable reconnection; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes. Premise implications (neural plasticity via body/memory) followed boldly without retreat.</comment>
