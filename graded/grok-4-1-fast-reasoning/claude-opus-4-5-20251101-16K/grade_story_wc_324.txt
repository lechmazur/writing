<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's micro-choice to shield the signal reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost (trembling hands), earning incidental heroism; curiosity trait labeled but shown in hearing aid reverence. Minor slip in "persistently curious" label avoids higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pulse to interference to resolution; Charged Poise closure in warm hearing aid and preparation reconfigures ongoing role with felt cost ("how many more... before her own heart fell silent"). Orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hearing aid as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (connects signals) and charges final image ("still warm from use"); mist evolves causally, mirroring hush to contraction without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe connection) tightens via predatory interference; Mira's agency in shielding draws cost to self ("screamed through her headphones, disorienting"), forcing trade-off under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden listening emerges organically from mother's "I heard every word" and Mira's final preparation; resonant non-literal answer reweights silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Mira POV with perceptual signature in static/whispers; dialogue natural/subtextual ("I heard you. Every night"), distinguishing voices; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tight propulsion, varied rhythm; minor mist repetition purposeful/patterned, but figurative density ("reeling hush") borders overwriting in opener without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral tech (hearing aid pulses) transforms mediation trope; incidental heroism turn feels inevitable from curiosity and tools, risking supernatural plausibility payoff.</comment>
