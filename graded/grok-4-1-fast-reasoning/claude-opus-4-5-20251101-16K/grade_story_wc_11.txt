<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unit-7's slow, methodical interiority and unbidden desire on iteration 47 create contradictory impulses between routine and inquiry, earning the final broom retrieval with visible endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as iterations build from sweeping to violin on 112 and playing on 193, delivering Charged Poise closure at "Linear time resumed" with cost in resumed duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen twilight courtyard and ice violin constrain observation across iterations, charging final image where "courtyard needed tending" reweights consciousness against dust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of thought origins signaled early tightens accumulatively via violin discovery, narrowing to play that forces stance; cost legible in abandoned-then-resumed broom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of attention-as-existence emerges from particulars like frost circuitry, resonating non-literally in Unit-7's declaration "paying attention is the same as existing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with repetitive "swept" rhythm as perceptual signature mirrors slow mind; sparse dialogue subtextual, as in admins' "How do you feel?" exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Patterned "swept" repetition taught early propels accumulatively without loops; high density in "frost grew along its neck in patterns that resembled circuitry," no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Janitor robot amalgamating self via looped sweeping transforms sentience trope, with ice violin as fresh crucible risking mundane continuity at closure.</comment>
