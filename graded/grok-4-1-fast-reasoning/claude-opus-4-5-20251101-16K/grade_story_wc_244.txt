<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's denial peaks in lying to the gray-haired woman, revealing contradictory impulses of running from gratitude; final acceptance of the rock's weight earns her change with emotional cost. Interiority concrete via embodied rock as grief. Flaw of elusiveness complicates choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: recognitions build density to "the moment when the story changes—not with thunder, but with accumulation," landing RR (Charged Poise) as Mira places rock and stays, cost legible in foreclosed running. Orientation anchored early via rumor chain to station. Single scene with backstory shards fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-wrapped station and fairy lights constrain gathering and mirror reciprocity's organic growth, charging final "ivy rustled its quiet applause." Sensory details selective via Mira's disaster-zone lens. Micro-setting (moon rock handled tactilely) shapes closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness cured by reciprocity) signaled via sister's whisper, deepens accumulatively through circle testimonies narrowing Mira's elusion; agency in placing rock/staying forecloses path with felt emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity emerges implicitly from rumor chains and circle exchanges, reweighted non-literally by rock's placement: "Something that had traveled so far, only to rest in human hands again and again." Invites lingering ambiguity on elusiveness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mira's perceptual signature (disaster efficiency recognition). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., gray-haired woman's joke recall forces Mira's lie; rhythm modulates from desperate humor to poised closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in circle testimonies. Figuratives purposeful (rock "smooth as grief"), integrated without muddle. Propulsion peaks at "She pulled out the moon rock," charging image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster-relief burnout via rumor chains and moon rock as reciprocity's weight; risk of accumulative structure with multi-speakers pays off in organic closure. Transformation of elusive helper trope feels inevitable.</comment>
