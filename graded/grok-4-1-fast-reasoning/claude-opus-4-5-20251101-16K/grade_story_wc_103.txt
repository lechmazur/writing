<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (safety via halo vs. pursuit of time's texture) acting in the central scene, culminating in her earned choice to walk the paths. Micro-choices reveal values under pressure, like pressing the halo fragment yet advancing. Final renunciation of escape forecloses paths with visible cost in fading photos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sketches to temporal slips to apex realization, with cadence shift in "She would solve her own unsolvable maze." Closure as Charged Poise/CR reconfigures options with conceptual cost (trapped eternity for understanding), legible in final walking image. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (saddle-shapes hurting the eye, time's burlap texture) filter through Elara's geometric bias, constraining choices like halo anchoring amid hyperbolic distortion. Recurring garden bridges charge final image, mirroring internal divergence. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart time's topology vs. temporal trap) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (photos to simultaneity to secret), narrowing to endurance choice. Agency in renunciation visible; cost felt in "futures she was choosing not to live." Protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's woven texture emerges organically from hyperbolic paths, photos, and final image, offering non-literal answer (understanding as preferable eternity) that reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like halo's warmth amid quaking bridges; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometric recursion, temporal textures); voice modulates rhythmically under stress, compressing in seizures. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to profession (hyperbolic planes). Prose as character: syntax folds like the maze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds—e.g., photo descriptions advance without paraphrase. Minor overwriting in metaphors (dying butterflies) purposeful for texture, coherent in peak realization. Clean grammar; opening anchors stakes, final recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, living architecture, and retrocognitive time yields inevitable topology of time; risky conceit (maze as spacetime fold) heightens stakes organically. No templates; final "worse eternities" transforms ambition trope boldly.</comment>
