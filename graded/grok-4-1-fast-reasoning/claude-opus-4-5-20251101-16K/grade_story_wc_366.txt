<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in reticence versus warm observation culminate in earned choice to build the stack and continue the chain, with visible cost of ongoing commitment despite decommissioning; interiority particularized through hands "that always knew."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build to stone-language revelation and closure via Charged Poise in sea glass stack and monthly vow, with legible cost in dawn endurance and foreclosed abandonment; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lantern room's cold, ghost-crowding, and Fresnel lens constrain choices and charge final rainbow image; sensory selection (ghost-light, trembling shades) mirrors POV urgency, micro-setting via stones/sea glass indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve legacy against sea's indifference) signaled early via observations, deepens via stone deciphering to agency in stack-building; cost unmistakable in storm-rowing and ongoing returns, escalating under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous connection emerges via stone chain and light-as-safety, resonant non-literal answer in final lens scattering "luminous ache" reweighting isolation; no moralizing, ambiguity in decommissioning lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in maritime idiom ("filed...like sea charts," "hungry sea") modulates with intensity; stable close-3rd POV, rhythmic control heightens pressure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "ghost-lamp burning bright" propels closure); varied rhythm, purposeful figurative integration (sea glass shades) with no overwriting in peak lantern room beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-language chain transforms isolation trope, risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes; final image inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
