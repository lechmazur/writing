<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to transform grief is embodied via tracing the daughter's stencil and honest exchange with Marcus, earning her endurance; Marcus applies pressure revealing her blind spots. Internal conflict in balancing hope/hurt shown simultaneously in "It will hurt. But it will illuminate." Minor reflection exceeds BRR slightly but anchors present choices without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of grief images builds to Charged Poise closure in stars shifting to new futures, reconfiguring Marcus's longing with felt cost of acceptance. Orientation anchored early via observatory bench; one tightening in telescope reveal narrows options. No lens ambiguity; backstory shards taught early, legible transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's stars constrain telescope choice and charge closure image ("constellations that mirror each visitor's particular darkness"); sensory hierarchy via Vera's craft priorities vivid. Micro-setting (workbench, glass spheres) guides actions tactilely. Environment evolves with stars' shift, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief transformation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "curtains of intention" density and telescope deepening that forces Marcus's breaking sound. Agency in Vera's refusal to lie forecloses denial path with hurt cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one reversal sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges via particulars (jewelry from ashes, flower from skull); final stars' shift reweights "withering to bloom" without statement. Subtext in silences like Marcus's sound; stencil reprise enriches without moralizing. Resonance from conflicting love/acceptance avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in craft-biased noticing (e.g., "hair curled like a sleeping question mark"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Will it help?" pursues hope against Vera's honesty); rhythm modulates from subdued to charged at telescope. Voice distinct, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "curtains of intention" advances atmosphere/stakes); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("flower blooming from a skull's eye socket") purposeful, not muddled. Propulsion clear, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry/Victorian grief in timeless observatory transforms loss tropes via origami coordinates; risk in quiet Accumulative closure heightens stakes. Stencil's evolution feels inevitable from backstory to thematic charge; no derivative echoes.</comment>
