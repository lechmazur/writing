<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's borrowed-time existence creates internal conflict between dutiful cataloguing and personal philosophy, compelling the pivot to embedding messages; this hierarchy of values earns her endurance with the felt cost of unearned days in the urn-handling beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as capsule discovery accumulates density toward network formation; closure Charged Poise lands in "time growing thicker... suggested significance," reconfiguring her role with finitude cost legible in silo's depletion image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo's green-glass gleam and chronometers constrain daily actions, filtering perceptions; urn fragment catching light on shelf charges final image, mirroring preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of textural understanding deepens via urn's "centuries compressed" forcing message-embedding, crystallizing into network; conceptual cost of her fading ties to silo measurements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-witnessing emerges organically from capsule to messages; final "mysteries... threads between moments" non-literally reweights damaged artifacts as successful delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("density and texture of time") modulates rhythmically across reflective density; stable single POV biases toward time's feel without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration like "time pooled like honey" purposefully; varied syntax propels to closure without loops, recharging motifs in final lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garage-sale philosophy amid temporal silos synthesizes fresh preservation angle; risk in accumulative messages heightens stakes, transforming capsule trope organically.</comment>
