<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between questioning puppets and Marcus's demand for clarity acts in reflection; serenity embodied as she sits "cross-legged on the concrete floor" post-argument; final renunciation of performer role earned with cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflective beats build density to conceptual repricing; dome and argument anchor orientation in first paragraph; closure reconfigures stance via "sit among them, passing the stick" with felt loss of authority.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's "curved above her like the inside of a skull" and listening purpose constrain rehearsal choice and charge final image of returning it to "original purpose"; story stick as micro-setting handled tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical method signaled by recalled argument; deepening realization tightens to renunciation under accumulative lens, foreclosing preaching path; cost legible in "trade ambiguity for clarity" rejected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communal listening emerges from stick-passing motif shifting to "stories... that taught you to see in the dark"; final image reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of "half-lit epiphany"; lyrical rhythm ("meteor hush") modulates serene reflection without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops; rhythm varies from short declarative beats to flowing images like "debris continued its eternal fall"; metaphors cohere without muddle in epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Puppetry translated from calligraphy into audience questions transforms artist-argument trope; dome irony and stick synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
