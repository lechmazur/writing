<comment>Mira's motivation to prove her father's theory roots consistently in inherited tools and notes, compelling endurance in the vigil; interiority embodied via telescope's warmth and cable creak. Minor diagnostic labels like "emotional topography" slightly abstract peak reflection without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds from cirrus "yearning" to final note "loved," yielding Conceptual Repricing closure where sky's memory reconfigures grief with isolation cost legible in "continued her vigil." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Gondola's sway and cold seep constrain isolation; brass telescope as micro-setting charges final starlit image, mirroring internal states via "warm despite the cold." Sensory hierarchy (starlight dusty, cable creak) selective through Mira's priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (prove sky remembers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via layered observations narrowing to endurance choice; cost felt in whispered "I'm building you a monument" amid swaying solitude under Accum lens. No reversal needed; agency in recording forecloses doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of sky's emotional memory emerges via cloud classifications and final CR image, reweighting premise without statement; "memory has mass" resonates from particulars like dissipating cirrus holding "passage."</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (clouds as "vessels," sky moods); rhythmic prose modulates from observational to charged whisper. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful figurative layering ("frozen vapor," "grief has weather") coherent for textural lens, no muddle in peak vigil. Minor paraphrase echo of "empty" motif purposeful, not looped.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as cloud emotion categorization transforms memorial trope; risk in lyric vigil heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via father's notes to Mira's data monument.</comment>
