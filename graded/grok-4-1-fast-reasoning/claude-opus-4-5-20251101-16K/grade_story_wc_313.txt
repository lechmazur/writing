<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Maren's shift from expunging memories to reclamation is earned through embodied weeping and micro-choice to tuck the label, revealing contradictory impulses (vigilance vs. grief). Weakness: epiphany "she understood what she was meant to do" post-tears borders on tidy without deeper internal alternation in the peak tavern beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifact density (chime to photos to cordial/photo) builds to RR closure in hanging the chime and writing, with cost legible in "hollowed herself of joy along with grief." Orientation anchored early (Maren on ridgeway, reservoir retreat); single scene with ascent shard fits defaults, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mud-pooled streets, silted door, oak bar) constrains descent choices and charges final ridgeway climb; recurring water/mirror motifs evolve (two skies to stars) mirroring internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy (ghostly chime heard remotely, elderflower smell) reflects warden's precision without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (suppress vs. reclaim memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via photo trail tightening to personal tavern image, forcing stance crystallization with agency in following/deciding to collect. Cost felt in hollowed joy realization; one deepening suffices, coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory reclamation emerges organically from artifact trail and weeping, resonant in final chime-writing image reweighting expunging as loss without moralizing. Particulars (wind chime reprise, sapphire label) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in inevitable rains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (precise measurements, humane fragility-handling) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds from measured ledger to lyrical hush under grief pressure. Lyrical compression taught early (mirrored basin) pays off legibly at starry ridgeway.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies (short weep sentence amid lyric flow); motifs like "mirrored hush" purposeful without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "precisely" (measurements, humane) dings slightly but doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drought-resurfaced town as memory gift transforms flood trope via warden's precise reclamation work; trail of photos to forgotten self-photo feels inevitable from setup. Bold lyric risk in artifact accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
