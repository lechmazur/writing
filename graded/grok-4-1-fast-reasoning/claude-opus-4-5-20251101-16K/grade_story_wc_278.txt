<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via tattoo glows linking grief to action; final tether earned by prior guilt causal chain, with embodied tears at translations showing contradictory release impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds/translations builds to RR closure via amber's "NOT YOUR FAULT," with legible emotional cost in dimming tattoos; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lab hum/voices constrain console choice and charge insect message; amber as micro-setting evolves tactilely, mirroring suspension theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (hush guilt) signaled early, deepens via cry translations (PAIN. HELP.) narrowing to tether renunciation; agency-driven under Accumulative lens, cost felt in suspended guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (untranslated cries as limits, not failures) emerges via particulars like insect vibration reweighting premise; final note image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with tattooist perceptual bias (constellations to circuits); rhythmic prose modulates from hum to hush, distinct texture intact under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels via "time folded... pages pressed," charging closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archived sounds/amber fossil transforms grief trope; insect's vibration turn inevitable from firmware logic, bold without gimmickry.</comment>
