<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via scars as "rivers of silver" and gentle tracing of fracture; contradictory impulses in holding "devastating knowledge with gentle hands" compel ritual endurance with cost of ongoing triage arithmetic. Final reaffirmation earned by Mia's letter integration. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from box carry to ritual tracing to letter realization, culminating in CR closure where placing box "close to her heart, where the heat from old burns still lingered" reconfigures pain-translation stance with undeniable ongoing cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; lens holds seamlessly through single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Granite outcropping and ridge path constrain ritual sitting/tracing; scars and box as micro-settings charge final image. Sensory hierarchy firefighter-specific: celestial alignments noticed amid flames' echo. Details purposeful, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enlightening pain translation) signaled early, deepens via Mia's letter into cadence shift reweighting innocence bargain; agency in reflective ritual forecloses naive saving belief. Cost legible in "bargain with fate using her own body as currency." Tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of broken persistence emerges organically from box/scars/forget-me-nots shifting to proof "split but whole enough"; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting bargained innocence without moralizing. Complexity in hard-softness avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: firefighter's patient celestial "waltz" amid scars/fire. Rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual ("fingers traced... with gently skilled precision"); diction controlled, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances reflection/atmosphere sans redundancy; rhythm varies (short ritual sentences amid longer contemplations). Figuratives purposeful ("scars whispered their stories"), no muddle or loops in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter trauma via porcelain ritual under celestial patience transforms innocence-loss trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in box's final placement.</comment>
