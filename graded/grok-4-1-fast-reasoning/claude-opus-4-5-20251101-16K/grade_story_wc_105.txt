<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's synesthetic trait roots motivation in consistent particularity, with embodied tension in "trembling fingers" driving micro-choices; final realization of her own voice emerges without unearned epiphany, earning stasis via relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as collected absences densify to faint discovery "in the acoustic sediment," yielding Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "hears it all: the trust, the breaking," reconfiguring options without causal rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain perception ("through the glass, into the water") and charge closure image of groaning endurance; selective synesthetic details mirror internal absence without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture trust's absence signaled early, deepens via elusive subtlety to discovery under Accum lens; agency in weaving forces trade-off, with relational cost felt in self-heard plea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's weight emerges via particulars like imprinted voids, resonating non-literally in "absence could be heavier than sound"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("aurora's green... guide her attention") biases noticing consistently; lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, stable close third-person POV enhances intimacy without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "forge hissed as she quenched" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm and zero loops/scaffolds sustain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Synesthesia fused with acoustic absences transforms grief trope into fresh premise; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable conceptual repricing, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
