<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied zen potter interiority shines in clay/wheel metaphors; micro-choices like kneeling to earth and gentle pot-touching reveal values hierarchy under pressure, earning final endurance without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from descent to pot-healed cracks RR; closure cost legible in "cracks sealed—not disappearing, but becoming part of the design," reconfiguring resistance to absorption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oasis constrains via timeline-clay and "phototropic to kindness" leaves that respond to tenderness, charging dawn offerings and departure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding fractures deepens from lantern visions to thrum intensification to pot-healing, forcing gentle stance crystallization; felt cost in layered realities acceptance tightens under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pots with integrated cracks non-literally answer "Why do some things break and stay broken? Why do others break and become more?" reweighting premise via emergent absorption theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with potter-specific noticing (sun patterns, thrum as heartbeat) and rhythmic prose modulate realization intensity seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "Phototropic to kindness" line propels without loops; varied rhythm accelerates from ridge descent to starlit potting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fractured timelines absorbed like centered clay transforms zen/wasteland tropes into fresh synthesis; lantern reprise risks conceptual boldness payoff at closure.</comment>
