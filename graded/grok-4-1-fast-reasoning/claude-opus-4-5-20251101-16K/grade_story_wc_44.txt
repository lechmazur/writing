<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find her father roots consistently in rune scholarship and memory loss, compelling progressive choices like winding the key and closing loops. Interiority embodied via tactile rune-tracing and breath-catching reveal character under pressure. Final reunion earns her transformation from budding to fully awakened scholar without unearned epiphany, though lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: winding key therefore awakens automaton, which reveals loops therefore Mira closes them sequentially, culminating in DC closure of noon shadow releasing father with felt cost of reconstructed knowledge. Orientation anchored early via isle observatory and post-Bending sky. Single scene with purposeful elision ("Night after night") tightens to on-page payoff; no lens ambiguity or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating isle's nocturnal observatory constrains choices via celestial alignments and rune workbench, charging final inward light explosion. Sensory details like groaning dome and grinding gears filter through Mira's scholarly bias, evolving with plot (stars wheeling chaotically then snapping back). Recurrent automaton as micro-setting enables key awakening and charts discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—closing loops to reach father—tightens causally via progressive seals narrowing to seventeenth, with agency in deliberate winding and rune-speaking. Escalation deepens knowledge/options per automaton fragments; visible cost in obsessive nights alters tactics. Climax tests commitment with on-page dawn pressure, resolving via her alteration without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconstructed knowledge sealing reality emerges organically from loop-closing and memory rebuilding, culminating in resonant CR: stars settle as Mira's "knowledge sealed by completion rather than loss." Final image reweights Bending's chaos into healed order without moralizing. Subtext in shadows as "presence elsewhere" enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in rune-focused noticing (e.g., "fingers tracing runes"). Voice modulates poetically yet controlled, syntax reflecting scholarly deliberation. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Continuation requested"); no head-hopping, elision purposeful in time compression to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Three turns for memory. Five for motion. Seven for speech" anchors action/lesson). Rhythm varies for ear, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (stars "wheeled in patterns"). Minor overwriting in opening reflection but integrates without dulling climax image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune scholarship, bent spoons as reality warp, and noon shadows as folded space transforms tropes into inevitable logic. Risky elision of nights pays off in charged closure; premise follows implications to father's return without retreat. Irreplaceable ingenuity in loops as knowledge/reality fix.</comment>
