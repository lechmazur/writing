<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's tremor resolving into still hands post-final knot earns endurance with embodied cost; contradictory unrest (helping others while broken) acts in scene via precise needling despite tremble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as knot density builds to RR closure—"net lay flat and soft"—reconfiguring inheritance with conceptual cost of endless pile; orientation anchored in first para, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prisms absorb whispers, pulsing with grief to constrain/charge closure hum; needle/net as micro-settings evolve tactilely, mirroring internal hush via starlight fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (ground spirits via knots) deepens accumulatively per unraveling, narrowing to trade-off of mother's peace vs. Mira's unrest; agency in persistent needling forces crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final net-as-cloth and "picked up another net" reweight silence inheritance non-literally, emerging from particulars without moral; resonance in prisms' transmuted grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual bias in "starlight fractured," "walls breathe"; dialogue subtextual—Sela's "voices in walls" pursues goal, distinct idiom from Mira's measured exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in "needle...glowing like sliver of dawn"; rhythm varies propulsively across knot beats to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Nets accumulating generational silence transforms ghost-restoration trope organically; risk in lyrical hush-prisms synthesis inevitable at "prisms sang with...grief transformed."</comment>
