<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (direct warning impossible, so sideways embroidery) act in scene, culminating in earned choice to alter the chart with felt risk of detection; interiority particular via "wisdom wore foolishness like armor."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments build to Charged Poise closure as needle "rose and fell, silver thread catching blue flame light," reweighting her fool role with undeniable personal risk; orientation anchored early, one tightening via princess visit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eternal flame recurs to constrain reflection and charge closure ("as if approving"), filtering Mira's priorities; autumn winds and cobalt dome tactile, mirroring internal whispers without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warn via embroidery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through fragments to chart alteration narrowing direct speech option; cost legible in "subtle aberrations" risking exposure as more than fool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden wisdom emerges via particulars (sewn impossibilities), final image ("stories lived in the spaces between stars") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature ("unheard stories" in pauses) with rhythmic control; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density ("rivers of possibility") integrates without muddling peak sewing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer-as-savior transforms conspiracy trope via craft-specific indirect agency; risk of subtlety heightens stakes organically.</comment>
