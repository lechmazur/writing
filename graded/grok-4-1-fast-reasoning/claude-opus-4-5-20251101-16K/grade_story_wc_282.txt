<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority via fossil's warmth and embodied grief; motivation layers official duty with personal quest without unearned epiphanies. Minor therapy-speak in "transitional object" deducts slightly but doesn't flatten pressure. Final endurance to map deeper earns via prior resonance with figures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from residual maps to active spike and floating figures, culminating in Charged Poise RR via fossil's warmth sensing daughter. Orientation anchored early (Vera's assignment, caves). Cost legible in final line's bridge across "sleep and time and stone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Caves constrain via crystalline resonance enabling figures; heat-map colors and upward water filter through Vera's professional bias. Fossil as micro-setting charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under spike ("deep purple").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice unknown) tightens accumulatively from mapping to personal resonance; fossil warmth forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost. One decisive deepening at figures suffices. Agency in continuing deeper under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging known/unknown emerges via fossil's reprise shifting from comfort to resonance with figures' grief. Final image reweights premise without moral: maps preserve for sleepers. No overt statements; complexity in science-mysticism embrace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (emotions as "thermal signatures," "orange...awe"); diction modulates lyrical under wonder. Rhythmic control heightens spike ("glow brighter...dramatic spike"). No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action, image, emotion (e.g., "pressed the elm leaf fossil against her chest, drawing comfort"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; zero figurative muddle in peak (figures' emergence).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation world, emotion-heat maps, factually mystical caves transforms sci-fi tropes via Vera's grief. Risky quiet closure inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
