<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Locksmith's traits (unassumingly bold) root motivation and compel the freeing choice; embodied emotions in mother's trembling and gasp reveal character under pressure. Minor abstraction in locksmith's interiority ("bargained with the architecture of the soul") avoids full contradiction in scene. Final return of hair earns change with relational cost legible in mother's weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hair's weight to star hint ("beneath it") to glow, delivering Charged Poise closure as secret exhales with child's felt cost of prior silence. Orientation anchors early ("shadowed nexus"); single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity; cost undeniable in "She'll speak again... The door is open now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus and twilight constrain timing ("wait for the hint"), charging final star-wheeling image; sensory hierarchy (star pulses over visuals) reflects locksmith's priorities. Micro-setting (hair strands encoding trauma) guides choices purposefully. Stars evolve causally, mirroring internal unlock without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped idea) signaled early; star hint deepens via lens ("disorient the fear"), narrowing to glow with agency in whispering/confusing. Cost legible in exhaled secret (child's "impossible longing") foreclosing silence. Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of freeing truths emerges from hair's unraveling to exhale; final image ("keeper of impossible keys") reconfigures premise non-literally, resonating with child's longing amid ambiguity of ongoing work. No moralizing; irony in simple wish beneath fear charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("moth wings," cosmic hush); voice modulates rhythmically under pressure (short gasps amid poetic swells). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("What do you want freed?"), advancing stakes. No head-hopping; diction biased to locksmith's ancient trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (long poetic swells to punchy "The lock of hair began to glow"); density high, metaphors coherent (day "hemorrhaged," sky "bruising"). Minor figurative density ("cosmic possibility" echoes) in peak but pattern-taught; no loops obscure glow climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: soul-locksmith transforms hair/ribbon into encoded lock, star hints reweight fear as floor; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens improbable stakes inevitably. No template echoes; bold cosmic hush commits fully without retreat.</comment>
