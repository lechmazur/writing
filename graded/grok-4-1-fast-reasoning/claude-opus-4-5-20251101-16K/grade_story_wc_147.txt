<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the bones discovery ("instinct to flee screamed... forced herself still"), compelling the vial touch as earned micro-choice with felt oxygen cost; interiority concrete and particular via embodied tightening and memory flood. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (timer ticks, sanctum reveal, bones/vial) to Charged Poise closure in "presence would be enough" with undeniable cost (mother's bones, redlined oxygen); orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temple's "gathered hush" and bioluminescent details constrain descent/ascent choices and charge vial's final glow; sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to oxygen gauge and bones, mirroring internal reverence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant oxygen stake signaled early tightens via timed beats ("Twelve minutes... Six minutes") forcing agency (override instinct, seize vial) under Accumulative lens; cost legible in foreclosed survival path, reweighting to memory reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral as "presence" emerges organically from vial's memory flood and final image repricing permanence; resonant non-literal answer in "small vessel of lonesome splendor," inextricable from Mira's arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("hush... woven, intentional") and rhythmic modulation under stress; stable single-POV with no elision or head-hopping, prose texture reflects embodied urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm varies (short timer sentences propel, longer images breathe) propelling to closure without figurative muddle or repetition in peak vial touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ephemeral-capture temple transforms memory-recovery trope via underwater hush and vial's non-trapping function; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
