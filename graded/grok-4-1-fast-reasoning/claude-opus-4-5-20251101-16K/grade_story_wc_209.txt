<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete postcard reading and patient window-watching; devotion as obsession compels endurance with embodied cost in early-morning painting; final gratitude earned as renunciation of full answers, satisfying 9+ test via scene-acting impulses toward understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from postcards to window revelation to mural; on-page CR closure in "boundary... thin to nothing" reconfigures grief to gratitude with conceptual cost of eternal questions; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and cathedral glass constrain revelation via precise light alignment ("morning sun aligned precisely"); charges final image with glowing panels thinning boundaries; sensory hierarchy (light, hush) reflects Elara's priorities, 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding grandmother's mystery) signaled early, deepens decisively via glass palimpsest discovery narrowing to trust-in-darkness realization; agency in sustained watching/painting forecloses doubt with felt endurance cost; lens-coherent escalation to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from night-flowers/darkness-as-presence particulars, culminating in resonant CR ("darkness is not absence... profound"); no moralizing, invites ambiguity on grief's quiet bloom; final image reweights postcards/mural without statement, 9+ test aced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (light transitions, floral details); rhythmic modulation peaks in "dawning hush" repetitions that teach pattern; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "snow receded... understanding crept"); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (palimpsest glass) without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden glass layers as grief metaphor, transforming night-bloom trope via grandmother's war-toughened hands; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from postcard seed to boundary-thinning close.</comment>
