<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's tinkerer traits motivate shift from science to song, embodied in faltering voice and pounding heart; final commitment to teach songs earns change with throat ache cost, though epiphany phrasing borders direct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via song-density buildup to vine response CR, reweighting tradition vs science with conceptual cost of neglected conversation; journal anchors causality without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dying arbor and dawn/moon constrain timing, evolving to charge final rustling image; sensory hush and tendril gleam mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake to remedy arbor tightens via imperfect song risking failure, agency in persistence foreclosing science with felt throat cost; one deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of practices as "conversation" emerges via vine awakening, final image reweighting premise without moralizing; earned through particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "melodies that curved" and biased noticing of vine patterns sustains single-POV stability; rhythm modulates to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion, purposeful hush repetition; minor figurative density ("green flames") in peak without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of songs-as-attention transforms ritual trope; vine reciprocity risks bold lyric closure, organic to tinkerer voice.</comment>
