<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation through embodied grief—"fingers thick and stupid"—shows contradictory impulses acting in the clumsy first crane fold, earning the final endurance of torment for love. Flaws like subversiveness against liturgy drive inevitable ritual thefts. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing; micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early pattern-teaching of ascent/descent to Charged Poise closure in final lines ("She climbed higher. She sank deeper."), reconfiguring grief with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single-shard coherence builds density without breaks. No causality issues; persistent constraint of detachment hour shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating isle tea garden and basilica constrain choices—cold stone aches knees during ascent, shadow detaches to trigger archive access—while mirroring internal descent; sensory hierarchy (ghost-light, pulsing gems) reflects Mira's priorities. Details evolve causally, charging final image without tourist catalog or white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing Lia tightens texturally through ritual density (polish, light, fold, ascend), culminating in endurance that forecloses peace with felt cost of "luminous torment." Shadow detachment reversal narrows options; agency in micro-choices persists under coherent pressure. Entry to 8.8+ via visible trade-off in trembling hands and aching knees.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief as inseparable beauty/anguish emerges organically from particulars—gem dawn of Lia running, cranes carrying sorrow—reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from charged callbacks like shadow/light duality; ambiguity lingers in half-believed prayers, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature biases toward luminous grief (e.g., "light that seemed to weep"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in polishing beat, breathes in reflective ascent. Stable close-3rd POV with no elision or head-hopping; prose syntax reflects tormented mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion: every line multi-tasks (e.g., "buffing each facet until the stone could hold a sleeper's vision like water holds reflection" advances craft, stakes, theme). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud test; patterned ascent/descent repetition taught early pays off without loops or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-theft lanterns, memory-strata isle, and grief-origami transforms tropes into inevitable ritual; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes via up/down paradox without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels earned from established world logic, not template.</comment>
