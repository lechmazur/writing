<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Eleanor with embodied philosophy and micro-choices like humming the note compelling response; students' tensions feel particular via recital memory but shift to harmony borders on tidy without deeper contradiction. Final chord earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from entry tensions to chord closure (RR/Charged Poise); orientation anchored early (library, academy grounds); cost legible in "not as friends—not yet" reconfiguring relations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rosette as micro-setting constrains focus ("pull their gazes inward") and charges final image; autumn light/velvet sensory bias mirrors Eleanor's subtraction philosophy without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile via harmony) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through speech to hum/join; agency in students' hesitation-then-soprano costs pride/hatred visibly in changed looks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vanishing arts/unlearning hatred emerges from rosette/speech/chord without statement; final image ("voices that had briefly remembered") non-literally answers braiding question with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd Eleanor perceptual signature ("traveled stillness"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Fatima's "What would we sing?"); rhythmic modulation peaks in chord description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("chord hung there, traveled and still"); no loops/artifacts; propulsion weaves image/action seamlessly to closure chord.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artifact-driven philosophy transforming choir trope; rosette/hatred unlearning risks lyricism successfully, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
