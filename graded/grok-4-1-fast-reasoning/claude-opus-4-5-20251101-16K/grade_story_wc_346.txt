<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied grief (puppet head pressed to pane) and contradictory duty vs. personal desire, earning the shift to singing the lullaby with felt emotional cost; voice particular via nested patterns motif. Minor slip in abstract labels like "beautifully flawed" but does not touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure (pane trembles, warmth answers, clock shifts "deeper"); orientation anchored early (Mira at lighthouse dusk); cost legible in "She cannot save the world" line crystallizing tenderness over salvation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pane of hush and puppet head as micro-settings constrain transmission choice and charge final image (puppet on ledge); sensory hierarchy (air "tastes like endings," purple bruise) filtered through Mira's grief biases urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (push back end via adjustments) deepens texturally to personal transmission, agency in pressing puppet/singing foreclosing routine duty; one tightening via "discordance in the silence" response with warmth; cost felt in world-unsaving realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tenderness at world's end emerges organically from lullaby transmission and final beam/sea image reweighting nested patterns without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "every atom... will remember being loved."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (hush/silence motifs, "time folding into itself like origami"); stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with emotional intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences at peak: "The pane of hush trembles"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (nested creases); figurative density serves textural lens without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday clock as silence mechanism adjusted via memory/lullaby transforms grief tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pane transmission.</comment>
