<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sera's motivation rooted in brother's death compels patient mapping, with contradictory fire/patience impulses embodied in "burning that never fully cooled" and final signal choice foreclosing impulsive paths with grief's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via deepening knowledge of ice, viaduct, moon paths to Charged Poise closure as messengers vanish across lake, reconfiguring empire's maps with patience's conceptual cost; orientation anchored early in sanctuary/lake; reflection interleaved without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt columns, groaning ice, charged viaduct constrain choices like village movements and signal timing, charging final "ice sings... balance until breaking" image; sensory hierarchy (ice warnings, moon coordinates) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient unyoking signaled early, escalates accumulatively through refined methods narrowing regime blind spots to signal dispatch; agency in plotting/releasing forecloses violent paths with felt grief cost legible in lake watchers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of glacial revolution emerges from fire-to-ice arc, glacier image reweighting impatience's premise without moralizing; subtext in viaduct/ice tensions yields resonant "horizons have shifted" CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward lunar/magnetic readings, rhythmic modulation peaks in "wild and restrained" refrain; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "ice groans, a sound of restrained wildness" propels via varied rhythm; minor paraphrase in revolution descriptions ("stop filling... stop building") contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of natural disruptions (viaduct charge, moon patrols) transforming revolution trope into mapped patience; "sculpt patience from impatience" turn inevitable from particulars, risking quiet glacier poise.</comment>
