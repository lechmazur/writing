<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation intensifies credibly from blame-seeking to acceptance via embodied letter-handling and admission ("He loved me... just not in a way I could receive"); contradictory impulses act in scene. Marguerite applies targeted pressure without dominating. Minor slip: Marguerite borders archetypal sage, but vine analogy earns her role without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via dialogue/images to CR closure ("folded the burned edge carefully... transformed") with legible cost (blame renounced, path foreclosed). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (bus, hill, pavilion). One tightening via vine graft suffices; lens taught early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vines constrain realization and charge final image ("some beautiful things were simply never meant to grow together"); sensory details (fermenting grapes, amber glow) selective via Clara's bias. Atmosphere tensions introspection; spatial choreography coherent (pavilion threshold to cottage path).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand mismatch) signaled early, deepens via agency-driven admission paralleling vines, foreclosing blame with felt relational cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise (carry letter transformed). One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in "not forgiveness exactly, but the precursor."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from vine parallel and letter reprise, offering resonant CR ("tragedy enough without adding blame") without moralizing. Subtext in Marguerite's gentle indirection; ambiguity lingers plausibly. "Intersubjective understanding" borders echo but integrates via prior causality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (letter as "small wound"); rhythmic prose modulates from dusk tension to dawn poise. Dialogue natural/subtextual, distinct idioms (Marguerite's vine idiom vs. Clara's hesitance); advances stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid fluid descriptions); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures (honeycomb columns) without muddle. Propulsion peaks in vine beat; closure image crisp ("leaving the pavilion empty behind them").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vineyard sentinel transforms breakup trope via grafted vines as irreplaceable mismatch crucible. Quiet lyric risk heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
