<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction between fleeing solitude and purpose shines in her waiting despite knowing she should flee deeper; scars linking creates earned compassion without epiphany. Girl as secondary pressure works cleanly. Minor therapy-speak in "surviving wasn't the same as living" slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ash, shadows, breath builds to Charged Poise closure in final sitting image, reconfiguring isolation with cost of future bridge-burning. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary details. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary constrains choice (waits instead of fleeing) and charges final image of shimmering motes holding them; starlight recurs to mirror emotional space. Sensory hierarchy (silence pressing chest, dust tears) reflects Mira's bias perfectly. Body as micro-setting via scars integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fading threshold vs. purpose) signaled early, tightens via girl's arrival forcing micro-choice to share scars and stay; under Accumulative lens, density reweights to Charged Poise with felt cost of renewed exposure. Agency in deliberate breathing demonstration forecloses pure solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of darkness as teacher emerges organically via scars, breath rhythm, and final shared quiet reweighting isolation without moralizing. Scars shift from personal marks to compassionate language in pivotal linking beat. Ambiguity lingers in her inevitable next burning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in shadow/breath diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in short, deliberate "In. Out." Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, girl's whisper advancing pressure naturally. No head-hopping, elision purposeful in loaded pauses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ring twist anchors motivation and voice); rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in "loaded emptiness" cluster fits pattern without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-keeping metaphor grounds mentor trope in ashen specificity; ring's dual knock reconfigures doors organically. Risk in lyric Accumulative drive pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
