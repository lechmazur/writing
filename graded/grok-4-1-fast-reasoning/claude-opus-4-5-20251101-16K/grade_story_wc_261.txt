<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Vera traces her scar, earning the final self-opening with embodied tears as cost; interiority particular via scar-reading lens avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to hourglass thaw and scar whisper (CR with legible emotional cost in "tears fall, watering the ivy"); no orientation debt, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and scar as micro-settings constrain choices (palm press, tracing edges) and charge closure image; selective sensory dawn light and whispers mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-avoidance vs. forced conduit) deepens accumulatively via ivy urging and miracle acceptance, narrowing to scar's command with tears as felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scar-as-library motif shifts from selfish distance to mutual healing in final whisper/action, offering resonant answer without moralizing; complexity in displaced gift lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (wounds as text) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from fogged haze to sharp dawn cascade without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in ivy murmur lines ("tunnel toward light") propels without loops or muddle; metaphors cohere in tunneling pattern, read-aloud ear perfect at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Displaced miracle premise synthesizes scars/plants ingeniously, transforming closure tropes via green network; lyric risk heightens stakes in conduit realization.</comment>
