<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied emotions shine in "bare feet gripping driftwood" and exhausted clutch of mallet at end; motivation rooted in family teachings compels fractal choices with endurance cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, muting peak complexity for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound density builds to RR closure; "battered but whole" and "exhausted hand" deliver legible cost in final image. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft, trees, and mallet as micro-setting constrain tapping choices and charge final image among "fallen apples"; sensory hierarchy (sounds over sights) reflects prophet bias. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freshwater via boundary crossing) signaled early; textural escalation in multiplying fractals narrows chaos into harmony with agency-driven tightening. Cost unmistakable in battered orchard and exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "chaos as music no one had yet learned to play" emerges organically from sound-build to final dissolution of obstacle/instrument boundary. Closing image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tuned to rhythms and skies; prose rhythm modulates with intensity, echoing fractals. No dialogue; diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively ("each tap inspiring three more"); purposeful metaphors harmonize without muddle. Zero loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic prophecy in post-drowned world transforms survival tropes; fractal sound as obstacle-navigation risks boldly, inevitable in hindsight via "named things became partners."</comment>
