<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin's interiority shines in embodied listening ("closed their eyes and listened with their whole body") and micro-choices during dissonance detection, rooting motivation to preserve wonder in consistent traits like grandmother's trembling hands; minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to harmony resolution; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final image ("Orin smiled, their hands still trembling... waited for the next wind") with conceptual cost of impending muteness reconfiguring wonder's preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sculpture's copper bells, crystal prisms, and iceberg constrain choices (dissonance from shifted chime) and charge final image; sensory details like subsonic hum filter through Orin's resonant bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder tightens texturally via dissonance detection and adjustment, narrowing harmony options with Orin's agency; cost legible in trembling hands and vibrations felt below, charging closure without abstract escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over words emerges organically from tuning events and final image repricing efficiency's loss ("keeping wonder alive in a world that had almost reasoned it away"); resonant without moralizing, counter-readings plausible in seasonal muteness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of vibrational noticing ("hum, a subsonic tone felt more than heard"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive buildup to poised closure, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "iceberg fragment... sing differently... deeper, truer"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or artifacts dulling propulsion even in reflective blocks anchored to present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world and ancient ice sculptures transforms trope of lost wonder into kinetic truth-preserver; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via dissonance-to-harmony turn.</comment>
