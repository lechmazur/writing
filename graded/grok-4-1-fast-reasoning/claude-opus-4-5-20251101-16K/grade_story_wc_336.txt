<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to preserve wonder roots consistently in her traits and intensifies via the boy's arrival, compelling the pivotal weaving choice with felt cost. Interiority concrete in actions like pruning and grafting, though occasionally abstract ("heart ached with purpose"). Boy applies immediate pressure as catalyst without overwhelming; final endurance of her role earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden tending to boy's stumble-through, culminating in Charged Poise RR as heirloom seed hums with captured wonder, reweighting preservation stake with conceptual cost of gray world's drain. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (parapet, waterfall, Maren tending). Single scene, one tightening via boy's essence enabling capture; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall vividly constrain choices (boundary orchards weave worlds, mist blurs realities), charging final image of Maren pruning amid humming seed. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward wonder (mist song, dreamwood branches); details evolve causally with boy's passage. Micro-setting (heirloom seed as tool) shapes climax weaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. gray drain) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via boy's raw gaze providing capturable essence, forcing Maren's trade-off (succor him while distilling his wonder). Agency in weaving/seed-giving forecloses non-preservation path with felt cost (thinning membrane glimpsed). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's preservation emerges organically from particulars (seed grafting boy's laugh/snowfall, gray city glimpses), resonating in final image of humming seed/pruning without moralizing. Subtext in boy's unfiltered gaze vs. screen-fixed children invites ambiguity on hope's endurance. Protagonist arc inextricable: her faith planted via captured essence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing "spaces where realities touched," moonlight blooms); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating hushed to radiant in weaving beat. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You did not imagine it"), advances plot via comfort-to-reveal. No head-hopping; voice distinct for Maren/boy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "She pressed the seed to a low-hanging blossom, and slowly, gently, she began weaving" advances action/essence capture). Rhythms vary for propulsion, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (membrane gossamer, wonder like hearth warmth). Minor overwrites in opening descriptions don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of boundary orchards/seeds distilling wonder transforms folklore tropes via specific world-logic (grafting dreamwood, capturing laughs). Risky lyrical frame heightens stakes (thinning realities), inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes. Bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
