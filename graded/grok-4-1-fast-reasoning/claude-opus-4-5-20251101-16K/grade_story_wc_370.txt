<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act on-page (crumples then smooths invitation; hides yet attends), culminating in earned final unclenching with visible emotional cost; interiority concrete and embodied ("throat tightened," "stones into still water"). Backstory anchors present micro-choices without flattening pressure. Flawless under Accumulative lens; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via paradoxes to on-page CR closure ("she let it fall—staying, finally, while letting go") with legible emotional cost in drifting paper. Orientation anchored early (cafe, clock, invitation); two-shard structure (cafe→library) tightens coherently. No ambiguity or debt; cost proof in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's "shelves spiraled upward into velvet darkness" and suspended objects constrain realization and charge final image; clock chimes ("half-hour before midnight") mirror internal urgency. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (empathic absorption of calm). 9+ test met: recurring invitation/object reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from mistake) signaled early, tightens texturally via woman's "nestled paradoxes" dialogue and book handoff, forcing stance crystallization ("empathy is not omniscience"). Cost felt in accepting helplessness; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxes emerges organically from particulars (library architecture, SORROWS shelf, drifting paper), final image non-literally answers central question (helplessness as bravery) with resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing; complexity lingers in "magnified human condition." 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (empathic filtering: "vast calm...contained multitudes"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You know exactly why"). Rhythmic control modulates intensity; no head-hopping or withholding. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("ripples through years of calcified guilt"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts (purposeful crumple repetition taught early). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dewdrops caught in amber") doesn't muddle peaks. Clean mechanics; near-perfect under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy guilt resolved via "Society of Quiet Pages" paradoxes transforms recluse trope organically. Risk in infinite library/philosophical turns heightens stakes without gimmickry; final image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
