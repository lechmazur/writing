<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "wept and laughed simultaneously" during purification compel the final transformation with visible cost to ordinary life; interiority particular and intensifying without stock epiphanies. Micro-choices like heartbeat paths reveal values hierarchy. Backstory anchors tilt present stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atom density and sensations build to CR closure in emergence image, reweighting premise with transformation cost ("skin that had absorbed three thousand years"). Orientation anchored early in pagoda descent. Single tightening in chamber purification suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal matrices and atoms constrain unpredictable choices throughout; pagoda's spectral light bookends and charges final star-reflecting eyes. Sensory hierarchy narrows to skin-bursts in climax. POV bias filters archive as emotional residue, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive guardians for forbidden knowledge) signaled early tightens via atom influx overwhelming nervous system, forcing endurance with bodily cost under textural lens. Agency in pattern-avoidance forecloses ordinary return. Escalation density reweights to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of innocence's surrenders emerges implicitly from atom sensations to CR final image ("anguished joy like a lantern"), reweighting joy/loss unity without moralizing. Particulars like child/lover realizations earn insight; ambiguity lingers in completion's devastation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in unpredictable noticing (dust, heartbeats); rhythmic modulation accelerates in chamber bursts. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, matching textural lens; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates image/action; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (spectral ribbons to glowing atoms) without muddle in climax. Minor elevated diction fits archival voice but borders register drift in peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia particles and unpredictability transforms forbidden knowledge trope; risk in textural transformation heightens stakes to inevitable CR. No derivative echoes; premise follows implications fully.</comment>
