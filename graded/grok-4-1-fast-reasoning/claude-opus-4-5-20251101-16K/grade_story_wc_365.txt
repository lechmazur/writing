<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through sensory mapping; motivation intensifies via realization that search was wrong, compelling redirect choice with embodied fear/resolve. Contradictory impulses act in scene ("never been good at leaving things buried") earning final step back. Blind spot drives mistake in forward tracing, balanced by competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of maps builds to pattern convergence at "Patterns emerged," culminating in CR closure (redirect backward) with cost in "weight... like gravity of collapsed stars." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via symbol suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details selective/POV-biased (e.g., "texture of oxidized steel, humidity at forty-seven percent"), with repair bay and shard constraining choices (maps navigate shifts, symbol redirects). Recurring shard charges final image. Hierarchy reflects urgency as crisis narrows to flare/symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbearable heaviness of not knowing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shard flare → symbol → map redirect, forcing stance crystallization with agency/cost in final grip/step ("texture of resolve, the frequency of fear"). Pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges organically from particulars (maps, shard, symbol), reweighted in CR ending ("truth was waiting. It would be heavy") without moralizing. Resonance from "withheld truth" friction; invites ambiguity on mother's act. Final image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sensory cataloging); rhythmic control modulates intensity (honey-slow dreams to flare urgency). Prose texture sensory-biased, certain within knowledge. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "shard hummed... flared" advances beat); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak (symbol realization clean). Zero scaffold; specific diction/verbs propel without overwriting. Minor repetition ("mother's") contained.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory maps + cyclic shard enable backward-weaving to genocidal origin, transforming multiverse trope via irreplaceable redirect turn. Bold risk in nonlinear reality folds heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
