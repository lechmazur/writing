<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation intensifies credibly from ambition to earned endurance, embodied in scent sorting and journal doodles; contradictory impulses peak in bridge-watching realization, compelling final stillness with visible cost as others flee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density and wisdom motifs build to Charged Poise closure in bloom scene, where Mira's stillness reconfigures prior motion lessons with felt stench cost; orientation anchored by ~50 words in treetop/cedar intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via nose bias (cedar/mist vs poison moss) constrains choices like inhaling bark and enduring bloom; swaying bridges charge final garden image, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed for healing) tightens accumulatively via Thessaly's warning, narrowing to endurance test; agency in sitting amid stench forecloses flight with on-page cost of isolation, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of undercurrent wisdom emerges organically from journal/bridge/scent particulars, resonant in non-literal bloom answer reweighting ambition; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "ugly face" healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with olfactory perceptual signature (e.g., "acrid warning of poison moss"); dialogue subtextual in Thessaly's questions advances stakes; rhythmic modulation suits hushed intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "perfuming...made Mira's head swim" advances setting/character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propels to crisp final image without overwriting in peak bloom beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory quest with wrapping-paper journaling transforms hero's journey trope; risk in quiet stasis ending heightens stakes via stench endurance, inevitable from early scent/bridge motifs.</comment>
