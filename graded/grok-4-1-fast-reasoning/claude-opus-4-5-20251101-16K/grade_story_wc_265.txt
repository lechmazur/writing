<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied sensing (buzz beneath sternum to gear in palm); micro-choices like walking toward hum and pocketing gear reveal values with cost of prior seeking reframed. Interiority particular, no stock phrasing. Minor abstraction in realization phrasing ("wisdom was not accumulation but participation") borders unearned but anchored in scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern taught early via translocation history, deepens through hum and gear discovery to CR closure (unraveling insight reconfigures seeking). Orientation anchored by ~100 words. Cost legible in "letting go of certainties"; gear pocketed as persistent constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (wind drawing "different voice" from trees) mirrors internal discovery, constrains walk to stream/gear. Final desert reprise charges image with gear's warmth. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent via "steel trees" to "metallic roots."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mind's frontier) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hum intensification and gear's silence narrowing to realization under Textural lens. Agency in pursuit/pocketing forecloses accumulation path with felt cost. Entry to 8.8 via visible price charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of insight-as-unraveling emerges from particulars (fallen gear as "silence that changed the song's meaning"); final desert image resonant CR without statement. No moralizing; ambiguity in "probable miracles" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (noticing "hum of insight" bypassing ears); rhythmic modulation builds to "laughed—a sound that startled" peak. Prose texture distinct via synesthetic details; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (hum "grew louder" links beats); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (brass leaves "trembled," wind "sang"); closure image sharp without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical ecosystem teaching epiphany via absence; gear as unraveling seed inevitable from forest pattern. Risk in surreal translocation pays off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
