<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as chronicler compels indirect wisdom with embodied conflict (hating grandmother's cicada lesson yet embracing it), earning the handover as credible endurance. Young woman's vulnerability forces Mira's micro-choices, revealing hierarchy of values. Minor archetype lean in elder-mentee dynamic slightly tempers peak distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from question to layered metaphors, culminating in Charged Poise RR at cicada handover—"two chroniclers now... holding space"—with felt cost of endured uncertainty. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (grotto, stars, question). Persistent cicada constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jade cicada as micro-setting handled tactilely, constraining choices (turned in palm, given) and charging closure image. Grotto's "salt air," "waves," "starlight in wet eyes" selectively mirror transitions, integrated via POV bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to immediacies under grief's pause.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (father's fate) signaled early; textural deepening via anecdotes narrows to acceptance of uncertainty, forcing young woman's agency in apprenticeship ask. Cost legible in "these between-spaces... where transformation happens," charging final poise. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of textured time emerges organically from particulars (cicada reprise shifts from personal grief to shared hunger), offering non-literal resonance in final image without moralizing. Subtext in silences and pauses invites ambiguity on certainty's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (watching "spaces between," pauses). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("What does that have to do...?"), idiom-distinct (young woman's blunt vs. Mira's tangential). Rhythmic control modulates intensity, prose texture character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful, pattern-taught (transitions motif). No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak (handover clean). Final line recharges motifs with image precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tidal chronicler transforms prophecy trope via tangential wisdom, risking lyric indirection that heightens stakes organically. Cicada-handover turn inevitable from particulars; bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
