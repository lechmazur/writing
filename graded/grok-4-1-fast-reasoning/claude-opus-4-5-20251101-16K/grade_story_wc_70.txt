<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cal's truthful trait and choice to reveal via riddle earn his change with felt cost in his "sad smile," distinguishing him from Mira's pragmatic drive; Mira's micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchy but lack deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through suspicion-to-revelation-to-ascent chain; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "carried something more precious than a solution," reconfiguring wonder amid blackout stakes; orientation anchored early in tower climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower's copper stairs and vault constrain Mira's ascent and solution access; "nectar dusk" and "purple shadows climbing struts" evolve to charge final image, mirroring suspension between crisis and miracle; selective sensory vividness filters via Mira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant blackout stake tightens causally via symptom-to-sabotage-to-uncorrupted-queen reveal, narrowing options; agency in Mira's persistent questioning forces Cal's giveaway; cost felt in city's waiting darkness and personal reminder foreclosing blind routine.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in routine emerges organically via riddle breadcrumbs and Cal's monologues, resonating in final CR image of ascent "through nectar dusk into genuine darkness" reweighting miracles without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing ("smell of hive smoke"); dialogue natural/subtextual, Cal's plain truth vs. Mira's direct queries distinct; rhythmic prose modulates poetically under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("needle threading gold," "metal rain"); rhythm varies for propulsion, vivid specificity replaces generics; peak reveal beat clean of overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone bees regulating lightning batteries, truthful keeper's matchbox riddles transforms eco-sci-fi tropes; risk in poetic world logic heightens stakes organically to inevitable riddle-payoff closure.</comment>
