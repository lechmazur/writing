<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in 17-year avoidance versus stepping into forecourt; rebirth of dream through touch earned by prior causality, foreclosing auditory path with embodied weeping cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to pulse to composing; RR closure via transformed dream lands on-page with "petrichor nostalgia" ache as legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystals constrain gentle steps and transmit rhythm via touch, charging final evaporation image; sensory hierarchy (sight/touch over sound) filters through deaf POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) deepens via agency-traced patterns under Accumulative lens, narrowing to touch-composition; unmistakable cost in "ache of what might have been."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-presence emerges organically via crystal patterns; final "compos[e] in crystal and touch and silence" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of silence/touch bias; rhythmic modulation heightens pulse moment, elision of sound purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short weeping sentences propel); zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "second skin" integrate without muddle in peak kneel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf composer in crystal-whispering silence transforms trope; risk in touch-music payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable forecourt logic.</comment>
