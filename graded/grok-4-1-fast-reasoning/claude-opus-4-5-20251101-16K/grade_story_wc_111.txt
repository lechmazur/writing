<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—deception for protection, confession to prove truth—act in the confrontation scene, earning her final nod of victory with the cost of admitted lies visibly carried in her rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as garden responses build density to Charged Poise closure when Inspector Chen declares the order "lost," reconfiguring stakes with the conceptual cost of metrics' inadequacy legible in the flickering meters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maze setting constrains past deceptions (sensors moved) and charges final image as hedges "lean inward" and regenerate under Mara's touch, mirroring her tending and proving unmeasurable recognition.</comment>
