<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority deeply embodied in carving gestures and grain-feeling hands; motivation to harvest lessons compels micro-choices like rushing jawline before kettle; earned reconfiguration from fearing "here and gone" to embracing it via prior lion memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as carving and rain density deepens reflections toward Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph (Marta, loft, October afternoon); cost legible in final cupped-hands image of slipping water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via carver's priorities (ash grain resistance, rain rhythms); skylight droplets and shifting light constrain timing and charge final wood-watching moment; recurring steam/kettle/chamomile evolve causally with her pauses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (contain grief practically) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through memory density and kettle pressure narrowing carve-time; agency in enduring impermanence forecloses clinging path with felt cost in "lessons...deserving the love while it lasted."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges implicitly via lion/wood/rain particulars, reweighted non-literally in final gouge-lift without moralizing; "here and gone" motif accumulates pressure organically, resisting tidy resolution through practical ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (scarred hands, lion structures); voice rhythm modulates from murmur to scream to whispers mirroring emotional poise; diction reflects widowed carver's gentle attention without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image/reflection (e.g., "ash wood accepted her cuts with soft resistance"); varied syntax propels from kettle build to cooling tea; zero loops, coherent metaphors like "contain moments like water in cupped hands" peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-tamer widow carving grief into impermanent wood transforms loss tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens rust-hued peace tone; hindsight inevitability in Empress emergence from blank.</comment>
