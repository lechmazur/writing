<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "foxglove regret—the knowledge that her preservation was also a kind of poison," embodying contradictory necessity and loss; final endurance earned through repeated choices with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via repetitive resuscitations to Charged Poise closure in weeping and tomorrow's vow; cost legible in "admitting they were dead everywhere else," reconfiguring isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Opal corridors and glass orchids constrain precision work and charge final glows; recurring tube handled tactilely mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) deepens accumulatively across orchids to self-projection; agency in humming forecloses erasure with felt poison cost charging tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of defiant echo vs. inevitable silence emerges from particulars; final image of her name needing preservation offers resonant repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing ("frequencies that whole instruments missed"); rhythm modulates from systematic to emotive peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops; varied syntax propels from precision ("gently systematic") to resonant close ("until her own name needed preserving").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic preservation in crystalline vessels transforms memory trope; risk in lyric repetition heightens isolation stakes inevitably.</comment>
