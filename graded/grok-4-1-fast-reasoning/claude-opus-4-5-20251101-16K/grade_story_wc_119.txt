<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (espionage vs. hope) acting simultaneously; final self-fortune as earned renunciation forecloses escape fantasy with existential cost. Backstory anchors to present encoding task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from encoding to dual realizations, landing Charged Poise CR in final fortune and lighthouse epiphany with conceptual cost of inseparability. Orientation anchored para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and rocks recur to constrain metaphorically and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (light/dark sweeps) reflects POV urgency, integrated into action like desk setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encoding secrets amid prophetic accidents) deepens accumulatively via examples and realization, narrowing to Charged Poise; cost legible in stuck existence, but subtle without sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lies-as-truths emerges organically from fortune examples and lighthouse metaphor; final image reweights duality without moral, inviting ambiguity on grace vs. accident.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light orchestration bias); rhythmic prose modulates reflectively, diction character-specific without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels accumulatively; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (currents, keys); rhythm breathes with beam's cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy-fortune-lighthouse transforms espionage trope via prophetic accidents; risk in dual currents inevitability heightens stakes organically.</comment>
