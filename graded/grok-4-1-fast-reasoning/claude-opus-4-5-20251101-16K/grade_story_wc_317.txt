<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via seed-handling and riddle-solving; motivation to safeguard innovation compels final design choice with earned renunciation of passivity. Contradictory impulses (hunted vs. receptive) act in scene, but heavy reflection slightly dilutes embodied stress in realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seed history and riddle density build to Charged Poise closure: sketch slipped under door reconfigures exile into collaboration, with patience as conceptual cost legible in "might never bloom" line. Orientation anchors early; no shards or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook and damp threshold constrain planting choice and charge final image as eternal witness; sensory hierarchy (mist-damp envelope, lamplight amber) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (seed in palm, window view) mirrors internal rot-to-bloom without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard innovation) signaled early, deepens via riddle into tactical shift (plant/design); agency in response forecloses survival-only path with patience cost. Accumulative tightening reweights corporate rot as foundation, but external pressure remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rot-to-innovation emerges organically from seed riddle and escape room arc, culminating in resonant CR: collaboration roots amid "neither rot nor corporate hunger." Final image non-literally answers preservation question with lingering ambiguity on sender's gaze.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (orthogonal riddles as invitations); rhythmic modulation builds hush to poised silence. Stable close-3rd POV with no elision or head-hopping; diction reflects receptive mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via image-stacked sentences; rhythm varies for hush-storm cadence, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in repeated "hush" motifs risks muddle, but consistent voice-motivated lyricism preserves closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical mystery mail to escape room metamorphosis transforms exile trope via orthogonal riddle logic. Final sketch-under-door risks bold collaboration premise organically from prior seeds, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
