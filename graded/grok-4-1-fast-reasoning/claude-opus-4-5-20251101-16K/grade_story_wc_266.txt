<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation rooted in "leash" backstory intensifies through embodied releases (screaming grief, laughing at spring), earning change; guides apply gentle pressure without dominating, though slightly archetypal. Contradictory impulses show in hesitation before nodding. Final uncovering feels earned by micro-choices on detours.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via detour lessons reweighting stake. Orientation anchors early ("morning after the leash broke"). Closure as Charged Poise in final headland image ("uncovered... carrying at last what she had always possessed") with fading star cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-parting path constrains steps, charging closure ("mist thinned to reveal the sea stretching endless"); sensory details (fog-dampened stone, waves breathing) filter through Elena's post-loss haze. Body/palm star evolves as micro-setting tying to doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim courage) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through detours voicing dreams/grief; agency in choosing path forecloses duty-bound past with emotional cost (screamed grief). Guides' persistence forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of indirect courage emerges via particulars (detours as lessons, pressed flowers metaphor); final image ("new morning, carrying... what she had always possessed") reconfigures premise non-literally, resisting tidy moral with lingering ambiguity of "not transformed, exactly, but uncovered."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (freedom as "half-remembered song"); dialogue natural/subtextual (guides' purposes evoke Elena's reserves), distinct voices (waves withdrawing vs. patient calluses). Rhythm modulates from mist-wrapped unease to star-emerging poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (lines multitask image/advance); varied rhythm (short punches like "She nodded," long swells like path description) propels without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle; "salt in water" embodies precisely without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "leash" for duty + veiled ridgeway transforms afterlife-tropes into internal recovery; risk in lyric detours heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via guides' vigil paying off in Elena's palm-star reprise.</comment>
