<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied actions like pressing ear to walls and tracing poison label; motivation to collect textures compels endurance of shadow life with visible cost in severed past. Contradictory impulses subtle but act in scene via balancing grief/joy fragments against her erasure. No unearned epiphanies; final self-assembly earned by prior collection causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of fragments builds to CR closure in final image of dreaming in others' voices, reweighting premise of erasure with conceptual cost of strange freedom. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (containers, tides, death error). No shards; single scene tightens via tidal cadence to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Containers and tides constrain choices (ghost movement, time-marking) and charge final image (groan song, blue container sleep); selective sensory hierarchy (metal groans, salt air) reflects POV bias toward overheard textures over personal past. Micro-object (poison label) mirrors internal erasure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build self-texture vs. bureaucratic erasure) signaled early, escalates texturally via fragment density and tide-pattern break at slack tide reflection; agency in collecting/reading aloud forecloses normal life path with felt cost in "severed like umbilical cord." One decisive deepening suffices; cost legible in final endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from particulars (label, overheard voices, her death error); final image ("She is no one. She is everyone") offers resonant CR reweighting without moral, embracing ambiguity of freedom/erasure cost. Subtext in silence around poison woman's untold fragments lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (reality filtered via others' memories); rhythmic prose modulates from observational to introspective at slack tide, reflecting layered mind. Lyrical compression taught early (tidal rhythm) pays off legibly at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short punchy quotes amid lyric flow); varied syntax accelerates at readings ("My mother used to say..."), breathes in reflections. Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (sediment layers, broken bells) integrate without muddle, even in peak closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghost + memory collector in container labyrinth transforms erasure trope via textural accumulation; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes of nameless existence, inevitable in hindsight at "dreaming in voices that are not her own but... something like a self."</comment>
