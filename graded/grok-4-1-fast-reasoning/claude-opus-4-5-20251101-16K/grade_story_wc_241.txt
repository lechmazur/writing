<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (distance from gambling vs. embracing contradictions) acting in scene via journal reading; final renunciation of "small lines" earned by causal discoveries, foreclosing prior stance with grief's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as journal scrawls build density to CR closure (copying scrawl, deciding to ride subway) with conceptual cost legible in "letting grief become understanding"; orientation anchored immediately, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library micro-setting (ivy fingers, pearlescent light, rain) and candle lantern constrain reflection, charging final image; sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities, evolving with rain's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling father's contradictions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via scrawl density to stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed distance, but minor abstractness in ethical calculus prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges organically from scrawls and journal, reweighting premise in final image (candle flicker, copied scrawl) without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via her adoption of hope vs. reason.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (mathematical mind seeing "cartography of meaning"); rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "shadows that seemed to move like water"); minor density in opening metaphors borders overwriting but supports lyric texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of statistics professor's subway scrawls transforms gambling trope via specific journal cartography; risk-taking in accumulative lyric form heightens stakes organically.</comment>
