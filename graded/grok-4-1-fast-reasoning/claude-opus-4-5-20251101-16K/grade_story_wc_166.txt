<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vesna's motivation roots deeply in tide dancer defiance, with contradictory exile impulses acting in her tattoo choice and final sway. Interiority embodies loss via "She could not return to that self," earning endurance with exile's cost. Cael applies pressure through his plea, altering her communion state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mortar-mixing to tattoo communion, culminating in Charged Poise RR via sway that reconfigures exile with irrecoverable self-loss cost ("She could not return"). Orientation anchors instantly in garden; single scene coherent. Lens taught early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twilight garden constrains tattooing (moss, phosphorescent blooms pulse with heartbeat) and charges final sway under wheeling stars. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (gaps, starlight whispers); garden evolves with atmospheric shift ("stars seemed to press closer"). Micro-setting as body-of-proof indelible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy ban via tattoos) signaled early, deepens via communion reversal that narrows options under Accumulative lens. Agency in needling Cael forecloses erasure path; cost legible in his "dangerous glimmer" and her permanent exile. Escalation subtle but coherent via density shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of migratable memory emerges via tattoo-as-verse, reweighted non-literally in final sway "in the gaps where no law could follow." Subtext in silences (Cael's "What do I do now?") and images avoids morals. Resonance inextricable from Vesna's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature via gaps/stars bias. Voice rhythmic ("Each puncture was a word; each word was a defiance"), modulates with intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Less than forgetting"), advances via "fledge" directive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels (moonstone "refracted it into whispers"); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies (short communion punches to flowing end). Figuratives purposeful/coherent (supernova on skull), no overwriting in peak tattoo beat. Paragraphs purposeful, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tattooed cosmos defies nostalgia ban via tide dancer gaps, transforming dystopia tropes organically. Bold risk in lyric Accumulative build to indelible skin-library; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
