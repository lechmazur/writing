<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority particular and embodied throughout, driving micro-choices like precise rope pulls; contradictory courage trait yields earned fulfillment in "wept with... joy," revealing value hierarchy with exhaustion cost. No stock phrasing; traits shown via perception, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of bells builds to hush shattering, a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost in faded sheet and exhaustion; anchored immediately ("Aureolis Cavern"), single scene coherent, closure image reconfigures silence as "earned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain ringing (translucent ceiling refracts light/sounds) and charge final hush; sensory details (frost-rimed ropes, tasted sounds) selective via synesthetic POV, evolve causally with unfettering without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfetter wonder) signaled early, escalates via bell density synchronizing with sculptor's chisel, narrowing to release under Accumulative lens; agency in precise ringing forecloses prior sculpted hush with felt exhaustion cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wonder-as-oxygen theme emerges organically from particulars (calcified wonder peels away); final image of released wonder reweights world's gray efficiency without moralizing, resonant via child/cynic vignettes as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable, perceptual signature synesthetic and biased (colors hum pitches); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, e.g., swelling during unfettering; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer senses/actions (e.g., "sounds braid together"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful in synesthetic peaks without muddle; zero scaffold in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, prism-song, and wonder imprisonment transforms tropes; "sculpted hush" as architecture inevitable in hindsight, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
