<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via spatial metaphors tied to grief; contradictory impulses in pressing button versus placing it earn the final renunciation with embodied cost. Blind spots in holding memories drive the micro-choice at closure. No unearned epiphanies; voice coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflective beats builds to CR closure in placing the button—"a small offering, a practice run at permeability"—with legible emotional cost of potential permanent release. Orientation anchored early in farm at 4 AM; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mushroom glow and mycelia networks as micro-setting constrain perception and charge final image, mirroring internal permeability. Sensory details (pulsing light, hum) filtered through spatial POV bias; evolve with emotional deepening. Environment guides choice via central chamber proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasping letting-go physics) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via familiar-stranger fragments to renunciation agency; cost felt in foreclosed attachment during button placement. Internal pressure coheres without reversal need; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Permeability theme emerges organically from science-grief synthesis, reweighted non-literally in final image of "barrier that grew more permeable"; resonant without moralizing. Particulars (mycelia, light) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "she would retrieve it tomorrow... or maybe... no longer needed to."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with spatial perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulate grief's quiet intensity without drift. Prose texture poetic yet controlled, reflecting embodied mind; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent (light/membrane) without muddle in peak reflective beats. Propulsion builds to charged final image; zero figurative overload or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion detection, mycology, and grief physics transforms tropes; spatial gift as lens for loss feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in button-offering turn without gimmickry.</comment>
