<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via glass eyes and mosaic-reading reveals particular inventive grief; contradictory solve-vs-tend impulses act in ritual, earning closure choice, though peak realization edges diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure at "patterns seemed to rearrange themselves," reconfiguring grief with legible cost of chosen uncertainty; one tightening via ritual answer suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dripping stalactites, mineral apples) filter through Mira's pattern-bias, constraining kneel/place action and charging final drop-by-drop image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve grief-equation) deepens via ritual reversal, narrowing to endurance of not-knowing with felt cost; agency in repeated attempts tightens under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of damage-born patterns emerges organically from ritual and mosaic; final image offers non-literal CR repricing prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (math in light/fractures); rhythmic diction modulates from precise ritual to resonant close, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; purposeful stalactite motif avoids loops, no figurative muddle or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cavern-math-grief transforms loss trope via mosaic divination and fox-eyes ritual; risk in lyric interiority heightens stakes organically.</comment>
