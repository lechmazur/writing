<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vela's mapkeeper expertise roots motivation in concrete skills like reading ripples and ice cracks, compelling her patient coexistence choice; internal belief in beings' harmlessness creates embodied tension as their noise "hurt her ears" yet she nods greetings. Final endurance of fragile peace forecloses banishment path with ongoing tending cost, earned via prior mappings. Contradictory impulses—harm avoidance vs. storm navigation—act simultaneously in her cautious advance through beings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations, ice patterns, and stone use build density toward RR closure in hush bloom spreading "like petals unfurling," reconfiguring noise into chord with fragile cost legible in "it would not last forever." Orientation anchors Vela, caves, and three-moons-ago arrival by para 2. Single scene with one tightening via ice-guided placement pays off sans breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain via "thrashed like trapped lightning" vibrations and ice sheet blocking basin, guiding stone placement at fracture intersection; final ripple marks on water charge closure image as new map. Sensory hierarchy (Vela notes primordial ridges, chaotic fissures) reflects mapkeeper bias, integrated into action without stalls. Thermal fluctuations from beings evolve setting causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coexistence pockets) signaled early, tightens texturally via ice chaos revealing "nodes of cancellation," forcing hush-bloom tactic with fragile-tending cost felt in steadying beings' light. Agency in singing transforms scream to chord, narrowing banishment option. One deepening suffices, charging final charting with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "quiet in the storm" emerges via hush weaving frequencies, culminating in non-literal final image: "storm together" reweights coexistence premise with fragile-cost ambiguity. Particulars like ice lattices and petal spread avoid platitudes; grandmother's "hammered repose" anchors without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with mapkeeper perceptual signature: patterns as "stories of currents," ice as "recorded forces." Lyrical rhythm modulates from thrashing noise to gentled chord without drift; single spoken line to beings carries goal-subtext naturally. Diction like "ripple-mark mapkeeper" biases noticing idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "stone itself seemed to weep" advance atmosphere and stakes; rhythm varies from short "She nodded to them" to flowing hush spread. Zero loops, clean syntax propels to closure; figures like "petals unfurling" cohere without muddle in peak singing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ripple/ice mapping + echo stone conjures hush amid luminous refugees, transforming harmony-disruption trope via "hammered repose" payoff. Risky world logic (sound as architecture) commits fully, heightening fragile-peace stakes organically.</comment>
