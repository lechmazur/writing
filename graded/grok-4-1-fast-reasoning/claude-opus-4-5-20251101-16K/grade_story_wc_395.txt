<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in patch and anomaly intensifies credibly to final erasure choice with felt cost of obscurity; interiority concrete without labels. Minor slip in stock "heart hammered" and "blood chilled," but contradictory lie-then-whisper reveals values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative patterns to causal revelation) holds; CR closure lands on-page when Mara copies coordinates and erases traces, reweighting erasure premise with cost of self-deletion felt in final image. One tightening via Chen's reveal narrows options; orientation anchored early in archive work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Archive's "ghost impressions" and patch constrain digging and charge closure reprise. Sensory selection reflects POV urgency; "echo of forgotten songs" builds sensed absence without stalls. Patch handled tactilely mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover 7319 truth) signaled early, tightens via Chen confrontation forcing stance; agency in querying and self-erasure forecloses safe path with legible obscurity cost. Under hybrid lens, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of indelible absences emerges from deletions/ghosts/particulars, reweighted non-literally in final "nothing is truly erased" realization without moralizing. Patch and numbers shift meaning organically; invites reflection via Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward anomalies; voice texture distinct in rhythmic phrases like "echo of forgotten songs." Dialogue natural/subtextual ("family trait") advances pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "deleted" recurrence; rhythm varies, propulsion strong to closure. Minor overwrite in "smile thin as a razor cut" but no loops or artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghosts/spaceship conspiracy transforms deletion trope via archive logic; Helios patch/7319 pattern inevitable in hindsight, risks bold premise commitment.</comment>
