<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—dramatic narration masking grief—act in scene via whittling and petal touch; final endurance as "own ghost" earned by prior complicity in teaching emptiness. Moral ambiguity constrains blank expression and micro-choices throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of narration/whittling builds to charged poise closure in final image of stasis inside vs. turning turbines outside, with conceptual cost of hollowness legible. Single scene oriented early; pattern taught pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows/groans constrain atmosphere and mirror indifference, charging final "mechanical lullaby" vs. internal void; bouquet crumbles tactilely, evolving with action. Recurrent turbine motif anchors selective perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of enforced lightness escalates accumulatively via petal crumble and bird completion, deepening to hollowness realization; endurance forecloses authentic grief with felt cost in "nothing could hurt you because nothing could reach you."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lightness as hollowness emerges organically from whittling flock and disintegrating bouquet; final "remade hush" image reweights premise without moral, embracing moral ambiguity's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature—shadows as "indifferent clock," turbines groaning—modulates rhythmically; self-narration as voice-motivated performance enhances pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory details; purposeful turbine repetition teaches pattern without loops. No artifacts dull closure image of "nothing moved at all."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate via retired performer's self-narration and whittled flock transforms grief tropes; risk of solo accumulative stasis heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
