<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene as Mira collects stories to evade regret yet confronts ghost, earning final acceptance with visible cost in "She sat with it"; interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as story fragments build to CR closure where "The regret arrived whole" reconfigures scattering as deliberate refusal, with undeniable conceptual cost in final wheel image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon's kinetic waters constrain wading approach ("waters resisted, then relented") and charge final image as light catches wheel's edges; sensory details selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiating eroded ambition tightens via ghost's revelation "I'm not the one you need to negotiate with," forcing agency in whole-regret endurance with felt cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of lifting wheel toward light offers resonant answer to scattering vs. carrying regret, reweighting prior story fragments without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fragmented noticing ("hours scattered like startled birds") and rhythmic control match tone; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "drip of water falling upward"; no loops, varied rhythm enhances fractured stillness without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scavenger lagoon for ambitions transforms tropes via kinetic surrealism and ghost negotiation, risking lyric structure that heightens closure stakes.</comment>
