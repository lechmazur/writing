<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting and shard-pressing embody contradictory impulses of endurance and unresolved anger, earning closure repricing; backstory anchors tilt present ritual without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ink-pattern density to father's voice (DC trigger) and Mira's ghost-embrace CR, with isolation cost legible in "snow piled higher"; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Opal dome's prismatic shadows and accumulating snow constrain isolation and mirror fragment motifs, charging final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ink messages ("FORGIVENESS. FAILURE. LEARN.") deepen dominant stake of wisdom-seeking, forcing endurance crystallization under accumulative lens; cost in foreclosed "correction" path felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost parallels (legal/digital/paternal) reweight failure motif non-literally in shard-heartbeat closure image, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via heartbeat rhythm and fragment bias stable in single POV; minimal dialogue crackles naturally with static subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; heartbeat cadence varies propulsion with high density, enhancing ritual clarity to flawless closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ink-alchemy defragmentation synthesizes upload tropes into fresh ritual risk, transforming father-absence via ghost parallel with inevitable closure payoff.</comment>
