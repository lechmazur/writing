<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in war trauma compels ritual choices with embodied patience; internal endurance forecloses quick fixes, earning stasis in "it would take longer than he had left." Contradictory drive to keep moving despite armistice shown through satchel collection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seed-scattering density builds to Charged Poise closure; tern calls and sediment shifts motivate placements without causal breaks. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; final image reconfigures aftermath with undeniable time cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Jetty's scorch marks, poppies, and settling sediment constrain scattering spots and charge final seed release; sensory details (tern cries, wind) filtered through coachman's bird-scholar lens. Recurring tidal shifts evolve with action, mirroring restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclamation tightens accumulatively via bird-guided fertilizing, narrowing to acceptance of multi-year horizon; agency in ritual forecloses instant healing with felt lifespan cost. One deepening (satchel emptying) reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of roots over ruptured treaties emerges via seed motifs shifting from war-rattle to blue-peace promise; final garden image non-literally answers reclamation without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like drowned parchment avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in dead-language prayers and bird translations; rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual ("lips shaped words..."). Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels ritual beats; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (e.g., "jetty stretched like a narrow tongue"). Minor figurative density in twilight descriptions purposeful, not overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war coachman-gardener using birds/dead tongues transforms battlefield trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight via seed-to-garden arc. Non-obvious bird-scholar angle heightens stakes organically.</comment>
