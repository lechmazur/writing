<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's colorblind perception concretely embodied in "muddy browns" and "forms... with painful clarity"; realization earned via glass rejects without unearned epiphany. Vera's silence particularized through plants as crucible. Minor slip: "innocently cunning" label slightly overt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure: reed returned, vine image reweights flaw-as-gift with retained limitation cost. Orientation anchored in phoenix dawn by para 2. One tightening: plant messages to imperfect glass circle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass sculptures constrain path to "hidden corner" rejects charging realization; colorblind filter on light-bending "imperfect curves" mirrors theme purposefully. Courtyard potted herbs tactile via rearrangements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (normal sight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to renunciation via glass circle; payment refusal forecloses "repair" path with unspent reed cost. Vera's arrangements force stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>CR vine-in-cracked-pot reconfigures imperfection premise non-literally; asymmetry motif (flawed glass, silence) emerges from particulars without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's suspected "wrong transformation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with colorblind perceptual signature: prioritizes "architecture of light" over hues. Rhythm breathes from arrival tension to unfurling realization; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in light-fracture images propels without loops; varied syntax accelerates revelation ("slow unfurling"). Minor paraphrase in beauty refrains purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phoenix-glass world and plant-language transform disability trope via light-form insight; "skeleton of beauty" synthesis inevitable from colorblind POV. Bold silence vow integrates organically.</comment>
