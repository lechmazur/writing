<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory guilt and competence acting simultaneously; past letters anchor motivation tilting present choice to give drawer pull, earning stasis with felt cost of empty pocket. Micro-choices like requesting specific prisoner reveal values hierarchy. Final confession and gift show flaws complicating yet driving resolution without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure where giving drawer pull reconfigures internal neutral territory with conceptual cost (purgatory as home). Orientation anchored early in parapet/moon. Single scene causality intact, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet/mist/wind constrain stance (boots in grooves, stand against wind) and mirror grief (mist clings like grieving thing). Drawer pull as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recycle mistakes via exchange) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when recognizing courier's sin mirrors hers, forcing gift with visible cost (empty pocket). Agency in "Untether him" and confession narrows options. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal neutral territory emerges organically from exchange and drawer pull reprise, final image ("pocket empty... become home") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting apology/forgiveness without moralizing. Complexity lingers in endured guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (thoughtful noticing of grooves/mist as emotional analogs). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why?"), advances goals. Rhythmic control modulates hush to charged silence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: every line advances via image/action (e.g., "mist curled around ankles"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts/overwriting; read-aloud propulsion peaks at exchange. Zero scaffold in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: redemption via talisman-passing in courier exchange transforms prisoner trope. Drawer pull/lion's head inflects uniquely; quiet closure risks bold, heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
