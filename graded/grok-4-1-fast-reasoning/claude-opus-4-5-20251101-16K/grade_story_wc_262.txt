<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory fear and tenderness embodied in "calcifying inside her chest, heavy as a stone"; speaking release earned by prior readings, foreclosing internalized grief with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as readings layer density to personal CR closure; "lighter chest" and descent reconfigure storage premise with undeniable release cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Booth's dust, iron scent, and projectors constrain psychometry and charge "post office for the heart" image; tactile details mirror internal incubation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stored love tightens via mother's tie, forcing speaking agency; release reweights with felt "cataract of accumulated tenderness" cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strips' letters emerge theme organically; final "post office" image resonantly reanswers storage question via witnessed delivery across time, no moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with psychometry-filtered perceptual signature ("hushed thunder"); rhythmic modulation peaks in vision density without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in "lenses clouded with cataracts of age" propels; minor metaphor stack in visions ("storm sensed before it breaks") slightly overwrites peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Film as unused love incubator synthesizes psychometry freshly; "post office for the heart" risks poetic CR payoff grown from particulars, transforming trope inevitably.</comment>
