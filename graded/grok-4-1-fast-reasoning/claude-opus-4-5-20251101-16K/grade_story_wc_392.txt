<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation roots deeply in her career and grandmother's journals, intensifying through embodied contradiction (racing heart yet watchfully calm as she reaches for the lantern); final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like photographing despite swirling memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: empirical pattern leads to lantern touch → entangled visions → supervisor realization → dialing Internal Affairs as Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (carrying ghosts into bones); orientation anchored early, closure charged by "memories she carried now were evidence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel crawlspace and lantern constrain choices (kneels in damp concrete to reach), charging final image (tunnel hums with history as she dials); rain post-drought mirrors cleansing without overt symbolism, sensory details (bare feet bleeding in vision) vivid and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover preventable deaths, break control) signaled early, tightens causally via lantern visions narrowing options (lost like workers or endure); agency in releasing lantern and documenting forecloses panic path with cost (ghosts settling into bones).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of carrying history without consumption emerges organically from lantern visions and final dialing, reweighting memories as weapon against burial; resonant non-literal answer in "tunnel hummed... reverberating through layers of history."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (empirical observer notes patterns, details rusted tin/cracked glass); rhythmic prose modulates from calm investigation to vision intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "The tunnel fell away" launches vision seamlessly); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, specific diction (packed earth, bone-deep exhaustion) drives momentum to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lantern in subway tunnel entangling modern negligence with historical desperation; risk-taking in memory-bleed premise transforms tropes, inevitable hindsight from "crawlspace that predated the transit system by a century."</comment>
