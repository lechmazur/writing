<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in her holding the egg amid self-acknowledged destruction, with final penance endurance earned through embodied guilt and micro-choice to place it; interiority particular without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as image density (cracks, egg, speaker, thunder) builds to Charged Poise closure in rain tasting salt ("They tasted like salt"), reweighting her grief with legible conceptual cost; oriented early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat and cracks constrain her pilgrimage path and charge final image, with sensory details (crystallized salt, thunder mutter) filtered through guilt-biased POV; recurring cracks mirror internal fracture purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant guilt/penance stake signaled early escalates accumulatively via walk to breeding ground and speaker release, narrowing to stance crystallization with felt cost in "It was not enough"; agency in micro-choices drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fractured grace emerges organically from images (cracks remembering water, whistler echo in emptiness) reweighted in salt-rain finale, offering resonant non-literal answer to redemption's insufficiency without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (reads fissures as grief-map) and rhythmic modulation building to charged ending; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and zero loops; figurative language ("cracks spread... like veins drained of blood") coherent and pattern-taught without muddling peak (speaker release); propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate guilt and lyric penance transforms eco-trope via specific egg/speaker act and crack-map, with risk-taking in accumulative quiet ending heightening stakes organically.</comment>
