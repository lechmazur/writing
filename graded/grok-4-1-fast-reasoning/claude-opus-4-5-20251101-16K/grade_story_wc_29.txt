<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied tension like "stomach drop" and trembling hands under pressure, with contradictory hope driving her persistence; final grim smile earns her evolution from listener to player without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain peaks on-page when subsonic broadcast elicits "CLEVER LITTLE SIGNAL READER," reconfiguring rules into Charged Poise; 11-minute window and risk of department casualty deliver legible cost at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charts constrain her final hover over switch and flutter under signal scream, charging closure image; basement's hidden transmitter enables secret interference amid university division.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to expose fake signal tightens via signal's amused reorganization, forcing amplitude increase that narrows options with casualty risk; her agency drives causal escalation to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of outwitting tricksters emerges organically through interference turning division into humanity's "player"; final "stars watched... refused to look away" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature filters cosmos via "hiss and crackle" and signal "scream"; rhythmic control heightens tension in broadcast beat without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, and stakes without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from setup to "signals danced" closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Subsonic counter to cosmic tricksters transforms first-contact trope via signal interpreter's basement gambit; fresh synthesis inevitable, with interference risk heightening ingenuity.</comment>
