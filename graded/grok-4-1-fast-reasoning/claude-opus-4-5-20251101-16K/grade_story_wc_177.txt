<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seren's curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like staying and demanding "Why me?", earning her transcendence; oracle's limitation creates blind spots that compound desperation. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in static taste and path visions. Final choice forecloses isolation with oracle's rest as felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dreams and fragments tightens to CR closure when Seren presses seal, reweighting fate as "conversation" with undeniable conceptual cost in "profound simplicity of finally stopping." Orientation anchored early in bunker entrance; no shards, seamless progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines, dripping moisture, and storm constrain choices (flooding shafts force action) and charge final image of "vines began their slow reclamation." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: roots invading command centers mirror decay. Evolving details like steadying lights integrate into climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (oracle's decay summoning Seren) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via visions narrowing to transcendence choice; agency in retrieving/pressing seal forecloses oracle's vigil with on-page cost. Storm escalation forces stance crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of paths choosing walkers emerges organically from visions ("path remembers being walked") to resonant CR: walking as "dialogue between choice and destiny," reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like spirals and seal reprise shift meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in ethereal noticing ("taste of static"); oracle dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinct idiom ("precisely playful"). Rhythmic control modulates to grit in climax dreams; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varying rhythms breathe in dreams, accelerate in storm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in "temporal extremes" cluster fits accumulative texture without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oracle's "blind to the present" limitation transforms post-apocalypse trope into fresh CR on time/perception; path metaphor risks bold synthesis, inevitable in "transcended the question by living its answer." No derivative echoes.</comment>
