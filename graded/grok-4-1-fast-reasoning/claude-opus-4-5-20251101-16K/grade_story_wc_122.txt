<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine when she "should have left it alone" but winds the phonograph, compelling higher-stakes immersion; final embrace of silence earned via embodied tears and chest-tightening, with visible cost of foreclosed sound-chasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reversed songs densify "filaments of hush," culminating in CR closure where final oak-heartbeat image reweights premise with emotional cost legible in "stitching together the torn places."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's drum-lined walls and phonograph constrain choices, charging final image; tactile details like "fingertips pressed against the phonograph's wooden base" filter through deaf POV bias, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness) tightens via accumulating records forcing endurance of silence-attention; agency in repeated plays narrows options, with felt cost in tears and foreclosed prior life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-presence emerges organically via reversed pockets yielding emotions; final "silence that sang" non-literally answers chase-vs-embrace question, reweighting music's rule-set without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in textured hush-noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from entry rustle to oak heartbeat, heightening pressure without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varying rhythm and concrete images like "needle caught the grooves wrong, dragging backward"; no loops, coherent metaphors (gray tide, filaments) enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Broken-needle inverse-sound premise freshly synthesizes deafness/numbness into tangible hush; risk-taking in backward-play logic heightens stakes, transforming tropes into inevitable CR.</comment>
