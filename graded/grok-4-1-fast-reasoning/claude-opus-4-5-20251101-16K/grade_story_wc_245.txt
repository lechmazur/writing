<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied touch (e.g., "words seeped into her skin like ink"), with grief's contradictions layering realistically into the mapping choice; final renunciation of endless search earned through forest fragments naming her daughter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising ultrasonic density to silence, delivering on-page CR closure in the stillpoint kneel where ring stills and emotional cost crystallizes; orientation anchored early in forest dowsing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forest's ultrasonic pressure and bark languages constrain dowsing choices, charging final earth-palm image; sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) mirrors blind POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (grief resolution) signaled early, escalates via note accumulation under Accumulative lens to cadence-breaking silence that forces mapping stance; cost felt in "quiet blaze" of layered emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief's sacred geography emerges organically via musical map, with final image reweighting loss as transcendent song without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "compass to guide them home."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (tactile resonances as "braille"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in note-building without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with varied rhythm suiting lyric mode; minor metaphor density (e.g., "bells made of moonlight") purposeful, not muddying closure's clean stillness image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic mapping and ultrasonic transcendence transforms grief tropes; risky touch-language conceit inevitable in hindsight, heightening emotional stakes organically.</comment>
