<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation crystallizes post-decoding ("to translate distance into closeness"), rooted in embodied grief ("stone lodged beneath her ribs") and prior skill, compelling the journey; final embrace earns shift from death-tracking to life. Contradictory impulses act in scene (rusty gift stirs via cylinders). Flawless under pressure, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from cylinders to journey shards, tightening at maples/shelter arrival (RR via reunion, cost of "sixteen years compressed" legible in embrace). Orientation anchored early (scrapyard, bloodhound). No lens ambiguity, persistent constraint (wasteland miles) shapes tactics to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Burned maples constrain arrival choice and charge final image ("skeleton grove where maples once blazed gold"); sensory details (dust-choked evening, crystalline salt flats) filtered via Maren's priorities, evolve causally. Micro-setting (wax leaf) reweights repeatedly. Purposeful, no white-room; body/attention (knee ache) grounds under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Lira) signaled via cylinders, escalates accumulatively through journey beats (salt flats → red tower → maples), agency in decoding/tracking forecloses grief path with on-page cost ("no decay. No death."). One decisive tightening at emergence/reunion; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (tracking endings → beginnings) emerges from particulars (cylinders as "tinted revelations," leaf reprise), final image ("leaf between them glowed amber") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures; earned via conflict, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (death-scene reading applied to life); voice modulates rhythmically ("wild hush transformed"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You came"; "I never stopped looking"), advances closure. No head-hopping, diction fits wasteland lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax ("The cracked earth stretched endless, monuments of rust rising"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful repetition ("wild hush") taught early. Metaphors coherent ("ice forming on still water"), rhythm peaks at embrace without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apoc bloodhound decodes phonograph secrets for reunion transforms tropes via "grooves caught gold—tiny variations"; risk in riddle-method pays off at maples. Non-obvious angle on survival/grief feels inevitable, no derivatives.</comment>
