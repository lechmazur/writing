<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in reluctant metamorphosis—Mira trembles at losing humanity yet proceeds—earning the final hybrid bond with embodied cost in feathers and hollow bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spices to scent to smoke builds density to RR/Charged Poise closure where metamorphosis reforges bond, cost legible in "She didn't want this. Thirty years of being human."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard constrains ritual—petals lift, moon-fruit glows in response—charging final image of wings scattering moon-petals; sensory scents (saffron, cardamom) filter through Mira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens via reluctant transformation deepening under textural lens, agency in "Mira let go" foreclosing humanity with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent bonds emerges organically from fortune's words reprised in smoke and final "single note in the cosmos's oldest song," reweighting sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in scent-memory links (grandmother's kitchen); lyrical rhythm modulates to resonant harmonics in her voice during peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via sensory integration; minor figurative density (scent twining like memory) in conjuring beat purposeful but borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Phoenix trope transformed via reluctant hybrid metamorphosis and rare spices; fresh cosmic intimacy in eternal orchard feels inevitable from particulars, risking lyric fantasy payoff.</comment>
