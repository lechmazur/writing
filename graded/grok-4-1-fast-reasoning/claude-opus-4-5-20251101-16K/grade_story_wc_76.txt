<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's prophecy-driven motivation roots every choice, from winding the yoyo to kneeling at the stone, culminating in an earned reconfiguration where "the version of herself bound by fate's design" dies. Interiority feels embodied and particular, like "frozen fingers" tracing the schematic. Minor reflection slips tilt present actions without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as backward mechanisms accumulate density to CR closure: yoyo release reconfigures radiance as internal, with cost legible in "what would die" amid returning tide. Orientation anchors immediately in lighthouse beam room; single scene coheres without shards. No causality breaks touch pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hunger stone's groove physically constrains yoyo insertion, charging climax; low tide pathway enables descent while wind "carrying the taste of endings" mirrors stakes. Sensory hierarchy inventive: salt-crusted windows, petrified wood via Maren's mechanic eye. Final sinking stone recharges motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy prophecy via reversal—deepens accumulatively when schematic matches yoyo, narrowing to release that crystallizes agency with cost of self-death. Pressure coheres through tide's exhale forcing timed initiation. No abstract stakes; visceral in "bones" resonance and light from "fingertips."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of internal radiance emerges organically from reversed clocks/yoyo to final CR image pouring light through her, reweighting fate without moralizing—"what is wound must unwind." Inscription shifts prior motif with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers in grief-triumph laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with inventive perceptual signature: mechanisms pulse, gears engage. Rhythm modulates from measured steps to velocity-spinning yoyo under stress. No head-hopping; elision of prophecy details pays off in sixty-year-old reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels: "string began to unspool on its own" layers action/image without loops. Rhythms vary for ear, syntax purposeful in peak ("Radiance erupted—not from the tower's peak, but from within"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward clocks, yoyo-key, internal radiance transforms time-reversal trope into defiant self-becoming, inevitable at "She had become the mechanism itself." Risky CR closure heightens stakes via prophecy reinterpretation.</comment>
