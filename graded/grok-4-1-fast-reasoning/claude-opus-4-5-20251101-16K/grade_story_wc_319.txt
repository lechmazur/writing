<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied feral actions like sniffing crystallized petals and contradictory dreams of orderly shelves, earning final renunciation of home with pendant's warmth as felt cost; flaws like dimensional homesickness drive endurance without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup from feral arrival to interiorized presence; closure as charged poise in final waking pulse/waiting image reconfigures homesickness into peace with legible conceptual cost of eternal vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden's mist/ice constrains waiting and charges closure via accreted books; selective sensory integration (ice on eyelashes, mist in bones) mirrors internal states purposefully, with micro-setting (pendant, roses) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guarding amid uncertainty deepens accumulatively through interiorizing method, narrowing to endurance with visible cost in pendant's anchoring ache; final image crystallizes trade-off without overt reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically via mist-as-unclear-not-unknown progression; final garden pulse offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting prior homesick ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("mist curling through her thoughts like prose"); rhythmic prose modulates from feral circling to poised waiting, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and integrated figuration (e.g., "heartbeat became the garden's pulse"); minor metaphoric density in reflective beats purposeful for accumulative texture, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian interiorizing liminal frozen garden transforms limbo tropes; bold lyric risk in mist/light boundaries heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pendant reprise.</comment>
