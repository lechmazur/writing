<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's echo compels her singing choice at climax, with embodied contradiction (shell warms as truth dawns). Keeper applies immediate pressure via dialogue, revealing rules. Final renunciation of control earned by prior perception under stress; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echo density builds from shell whisper to nexus chorus, culminating in CR (dead choose Mira) with conceptual cost (delayed echo choice). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mira at nexus, tonight). Single scene, no shards; closure image reconfigures premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus as amplifier constrains climax (walls hum, bloom with voices), charging final image of fading song and hum. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's perception (subharmonics, emotional residues). Details evolve causally (hum intensifies), mirroring internal realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why echoes persist) signaled early, tightens via Keeper revelation narrowing to choice (shell or chorus). Mira's agency in singing forces Keeper flight, with felt cost (grandmother's final whisper forecloses fragment trap). Escalation under Accumulative lens: pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen persistence emerges from particulars (shell anchor, nexus convergence), reweighted in CR (dead choose hearers). Final image ("Echo when you're ready") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Keeper's "preservation" vs. Mira's freedom lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (hears ancient griefs, cosmic hum). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically to peak chorus; dialogue distinct (Keeper's reed laugh vs. Mira's careful probes carries subtext). No head-hopping; diction fits perceptive singer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multitask (e.g., "shell still whispered" advances plot/character/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety peaks in song ("voices braided... bloomed"); no loops, coherent metaphors (walls bloom). Propulsion aligns with pressure, zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo-as-choice in sonic nexus transforms ghost trope via perceptual physics. Risky lyric closure (fading hum) heightens cosmic stakes organically. No derivatives; inevitability of chorus from setup particulars.</comment>
