<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation as penance through preservation is concrete and intensifies via confession to Emil, with contradictory impulses (complicity vs. noticing) embodied in touching the bread's crust. Emil applies secondary pressure without overshadowing. Final endurance of tenuous absolution earned by prior micro-choices like hiding the bread; voice distinct in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (records, bread, confession) builds to Charged Poise closure in gathering and planting image, reweighting remembrance with tenuous cost legible in "never solid, never certain, but present." Orientation anchored early (tea house, visitor); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown palace/tea house constrains access and enables secrecy, charging final candle-lit gathering; guerrilla garden details (thorns, herbs) tactile and purposeful, mirroring persistence. Sensory hierarchy (aroma of bread, wind in plants) POV-biased toward noticing; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth/absolution vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Emil's forgiveness revelation, narrowing to shared bread with felt relational cost. Agency in confession/planting forecloses forgetting; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinary/remembrance emerges from particulars (bread aroma, guerrilla plants), reweighted in final jasmine image as "quiet unmaking of erasure" without moralizing. Subtext in confession's ambiguity invites reflection; protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (noticing erasures, scents) stable, biased toward ordinary sacred; dialogue goal-driven with subtext (Emil's "absolves you?"). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at end; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "broke off a piece... releasing an aroma"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; specific diction (sourdough starter age) advances without overwriting. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: creeping normality via guerrilla tea house transforms dystopian erasure trope into ordinary rituals; risk in confessional vulnerability heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; jasmine planting inflects remembrance non-obviously.</comment>
