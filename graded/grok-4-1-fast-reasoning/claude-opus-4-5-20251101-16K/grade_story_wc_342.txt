<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in concrete interiority tied to prosopagnosia, with micro-choices like tracing spines revealing limits as redirection; earned change in realization feels compelled by prior limitation. Blind spots drive struggle without safety-hedging. Final pocketed coin moment integrates flaw into gift with visible cost of library loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to coin-tracing epiphany, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("She was discovering her limits, and they were not barriers") with legible cost in library's on-page collapse. Orientation anchored early ("tree trunk library would fall within the hour"). One tightening via parchment suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bark-lined walls and coin's indentations function as micro-settings constraining discovery and charging final image (coin "warm against her palm, carrying infinity"); sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) reflects POV bias. Demolition rumble evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secret technique before collapse) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via coin realization narrowing painting options; agency in tracing/decision to leave forecloses return path. Cost visible in "first timber cracked" as knowledge lost, though personal gain tempers. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of limits-as-gift emerges organically from coin's infinity-in-constraint and Vane parallel, resonating in final image without moralizing; epiphany earned via tactile struggle. Subtext in "souls weren't visible. They were felt" invites ambiguity on seeing/feeling. Minor echo in ending lines slightly overt but anchored in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fractal patterns, touch primacy); voice modulates rhythmically from hush to thunder, diction controlled and biased (e.g., "geometry of wrinkles"). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance insight/action); rhythm varies naturally, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent ("map of infinite detail pressed into finite metal") without muddle in peak (coin-tracing). Zero artifacts touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist + fractal coin transforms limitation trope into infinity-in-constraint; risk in tactile epiphany heightens stakes organically. Premise non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight via library collapse/escape. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
