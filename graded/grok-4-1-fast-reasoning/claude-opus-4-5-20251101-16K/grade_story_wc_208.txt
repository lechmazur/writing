<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spirited sculptor's traits shine in concrete interiority ("strip away until truth remained") and micro-choice to reimagine via art lens during second lightning, earning final weaving into alliances with conceptual cost of perpetual interconnection; contradictory impulses between simplifying and layering act simultaneously without summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: slide discovery and visions build density to CR closure ("she knew exactly where she was, and when, and with whom"), reweighting isolation with alliance cost in pocketing slide; orientation anchored early (truck, coast, storm); one tightening via reimagining suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and slide constrain shelter/visions, charging final sculpture plan; sensory hierarchy (turbine-hum wind, salt spray) filtered through sculptor's bias evolves causally as storm eases, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of storm-learning tightens accumulatively via visions to reimagining agency, foreclosing solitary instinct with alliance cost ("I'm still learning what you knew"); pressure coheres to Charged Poise in truck departure, cost felt in perpetual chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Layered alliances emerge organically from visions and sculptures, final image of slide-tool reweights simplicity/complexity premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity in futures lingers with conceptual cost of inherited wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with sculptor's perceptual signature ("grain of wood, patience of tides") modulates rhythmically under storm stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in reverie closure without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("Lightning split the sky. Maren held the slide up instinctively"), no loops/artifacts/muddled figs in peak visions; rhythm breathes with storm cadence to charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Victorian slide as timeweaver for driftwood artist transforms trope via archway layers; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at sculpture plan.</comment>
