<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction in "technically gentle hands" that destroyed now restore, with micro-choices like coaxing rope fibers revealing values; final commitment to new bells earns change with responsibility cost over guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reconfiguration hum triggers aurora response and light-through-card sound (DC/RR closure), with weeping as legible emotional cost in final kneeling moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice sanctum and aurora constrain ritual via refraction and preservation cold, charging closure image of light-streaming voids producing names.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake signaled early tightens via rope braid yielding hum and sound emergence, driven by Mira's agency with responsibility cost foreclosing guilt path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emergent theme of preservation-via-voids (lost wax, punched holes) reweights via names rung through light, resonant non-literal answer in final warm card image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward pattern-noticing (braids, holes); rhythmic diction modulates ritual intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "light poured through the ice walls, refracted and multiplied"); varied rhythm propels to sound climax without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of punched card/light-to-sound alchemy transforms loss trope, inevitable from rope-void motifs heightening stakes organically.</comment>
