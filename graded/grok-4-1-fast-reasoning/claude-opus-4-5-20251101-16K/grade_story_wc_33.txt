<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emil's motivation rooted in daughter's loss compels micro-choices like memorizing Sara's photo, with contradictory impulses (fragile hope vs. doubt) acting in the drop scene. Internal shift to healing-in-motion earned via linking absences. Backstory anchors tilt present (e.g., "She'd be fifteen now"), no therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from drop to drone pass to plan, culminating in CR closure ("healing happened differently... in motion") reweighting premise with conceptual cost of endless rebellion. Orientation anchored in first para; single scene coherent. Cost legible in final image of carrying "storms and photographs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's glow and broken clock constrain drop timing and charge final image ("cobalt glow deepened"); twilight confuses sensors, mirroring internal hope. Sensory hierarchy (whirring drone, brittle hush) reflects Emil's priorities. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fostering reunions vs. drones/borders) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drone whir ("both went still") forcing micro-endurance and Kovac plan. Agency in thunderstorm prep forecloses safe path; cost felt in "fragile as old glass" hope. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of borders vs. blood emerges from particulars (maps of missing, Sara's photo); final CR ("sky belonged to promises kept") non-literally answers healing question, recharging absences motif without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures; ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (linking absences as maps); voice texture precise-poetic, modulates under drone stress (short sentences). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Kovac family. Tonight?"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "Fifteen minutes. That was his window."); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion weaves image/action (thunderstorm "weighed heavy"); closure image charged without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mail-smuggling as "respectfully rebellious" transforms border trope via letter-seams and absence-maps. Quiet CR ending risks bold (no explosive climax), heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from early map motif.</comment>
