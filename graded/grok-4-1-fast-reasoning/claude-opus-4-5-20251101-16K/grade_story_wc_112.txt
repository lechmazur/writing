<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal dreams/memories drives micro-choices like lever pull; interiority concrete via embodied warmth and sideways dreams. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly summarized ("persistent sense") rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, but final endurance earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page CR closure ("nothing was ever truly past") with conceptual cost in worldview shift; orientation anchored early (station, role, moths). Single scene causality holds via activation-vision-fade; persistent moth constraint shapes timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station, moths, twilight constrain choices (interference window forces haste); mechanically warm walls recur to charge final image of tenderness amid vastness. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mechanic notes hull warmth, nexus hum); no white-room, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens via vision deepening knowledge under Accumulative lens; one reversal (overlay appears) narrows to acceptance. Cost felt in foreclosed linear view, legible in smile/heartbeat pause; agency in lever pull/endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (time as adjacent plane) emerges organically from nexus vision and final wall-touch; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing ("touchable, real"). Subtext in icy warmth dialogue layers complexity; no platitudes, invites ambiguity on simultaneity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mechanic's tactile bias: walls, levers); voice rhythmic, modulates to hushed intensity. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("Does it matter?"); no head-hopping, diction fits blue-collar savant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring buildup (short sentences at activation); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Minor register elevation ("holographic principles") purposeful for concept; closure image clear, vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanic's jury-rigged nexus proves sideways time amid xenobio station; risk in poetic sci-fi physics pays off in CR without gimmick. Transformation of tropes (time travel as adjacency) feels inevitable via lived mechanic detail.</comment>
