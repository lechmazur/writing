<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in her discovery and diagnosis, driving micro-choices like wiring spirals; embodied serenity ("leaned against it like an old friend") reveals character under decline. No on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken internal conflict depth, though endurance earns closure. Flawless trait integration avoids stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup (oaks' luminous greens, pillar whorls) to CR closure: "oak shoots and pale tendrils... embracing the metal," reweighting symbiosis with her death's conceptual cost legible in final image. Time shards taught early via months/weeks; no orientation debt. Persistent time constraint shapes tactics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via ladder climbs, wire access, pillar warmth enabling lean; charges closure with interwoven growth on copper. Sensory hierarchy (phosphorescence at dawn, pulsing stone) filters through Maren's botanical bias, evolving causally without static repetition. Micro-setting (copper glints) mirrors internal restoration perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore symbiosis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via third-month changes and final immobility narrowing options; agency in wiring forces trade-off with decline. Cost felt in "could no longer climb," charging poise at sunset lean. Single deepening suffices under lens, but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies reciprocity emerges via particulars (fungi bridges, wire translation), culminating in resonant CR: pillars' tendrils embracing her legacy without moral state. Final image reweights premise organically, inviting ambiguity on human neglect. No tidy binaries; counter-reading (visitors' blindness) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (systematic observations like "pulse imperceptibly"); diction/rhythm modulate serenely to charged closure without drift. Perceptual bias (noticing root embraces) biases vividly; no elision or head-hopping. Voice texture distinct, prose-mind aligned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "wrapping copper wire... glinted amber" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm breathes with time jumps, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in changes description purposeful, not overwriting. Closure image crisp, zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calcified organisms and copper-conducted symbiosis transforms dying-legacy trope via biological ingenuity; risk in living architecture payoff feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; premise commits boldly to implications, heightening stakes through irreplaceable particulars like phosphorescent pillars.</comment>
