<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between individual and collective grief act in scene via retracing commissions; final sketching choice earned by lineage pressure and spectral guidance with cost of ongoing meditation. Interiority concrete and embodied in greenhouse visits. No safety-hedging; flaws in scale-blindness drive struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from visitations to poem recall, culminating in on-page CR closure ("one wound that the whole body carried") with conceptual cost of reweighted grief architecture. Orientation anchored early (greenhouse, monarchs). One tightening via "retrace" suffices; final image reconfigures inheritance maps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse/micro-setting (ferns, cracked panes, wings pulsing) constrains dusk visits and charges final image of darkness/wings; sensory hierarchy (orange light, thickened air) reflects meditative urgency. Details tactile/lived-in, mirroring internal migration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collective grief shape) signaled early, deepens via agency in retracing/studying to poem realization under accumulative lens; cost legible in foreclosed individual approach and held grief. One pressure point (grandmother's "Retrace") narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory/grief-as-migration emerges from monarchs, poems, stone without statement; final spiral sketch/spiral names offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting particulars. Complexity in counter-reading (dead travel through living) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fierce holding-on of grief edges); rhythmic control modulates from thick air to thundering calm. Spectral voice natural/subtextual, distinct from internal. No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "orange wings catching October light like stained glass") propels with varied rhythm/syntax matching meditative pulse. No overwriting; metaphors coherent, peak beats clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of monarch migration, spectral stone-carving lineage, collective grief spiral transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative close heightens inheritance stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
