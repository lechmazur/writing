<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grim optimist traits drive persistent climb and math proofs with contradictory hope/darkness embodied in dice handling; final push earns change via prior causality. Micro-choices like rolling dice under monotony reveal values hierarchy. Slight opening label-speak ("grim optimist") is shown through actions without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: measurement density builds to pattern revelation at "every 847,293 steps," enabling rupture DC/CR with conceptual cost (staircase as "question"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure image ("stepped through") reconfigures eternity with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Staircase constrains via measured curvature variations guiding proofs and push; dice as micro-object charges rupture with tactile specificity ("chipped... flaw visible"). Sensory hierarchy (marble coldness, sourceless light) reflects Vera's mathematical bias. Final "marble felt warm" mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rupture to regret) signaled early, tightens via pattern discovery narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in proofs/push forecloses endless climb with felt cost. Escalation driven by observation calculus, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of choice amid infinity emerges via dice/staircase particulars, reweighted in CR ("not a prison... a question"); final image non-literally answers without moralizing. Dice reprise shifts regret from ash to capturable texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (equations tracking "sound traveled"); rhythmic control modulates from monotony to "heart... race" under pressure. Diction reflects Vera's precision without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer math/emotion without loops; varied rhythm peaks at "pushed... wound in fabric." No artifacts; purposeful repetition ("next step, next breath") teaches pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-proofs breaking infinite regret-stairs transforms Sisyphean trope; risk in rupture as question heightens stakes organically. Dice imperfection inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
