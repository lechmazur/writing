<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's concrete interiority and micro-choices (chalk encoding under Vera's plea) earn her endurance at closure; Vera applies targeted pressure as secondary without bloat. Minimal shown contradictory impulses limits peak 9+; no flaws touch handoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Charged Poise closure ("surface mail knows patience" reconfigures stakes with patience cost vs. Network speed). Orientation anchored early (arcade/Mira's role); single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arcade's shadows/carousel constrain secretive meet; chalk/concrete charges final wash-away image mirroring theme. Sensory filter (holograms vs. analog tactility) POV-specific, purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Daughter's flagging signals stake early; name-sharing tightens via trust, slowness reweights as felt cost in mail instructions. Agency in encoding/endurance coheres under accumulative lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Margins motif emerges via chalk/letters, final carousel image resonantly answers digital vs. analog without statement. Complexity in beautiful deviance lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (noticing relics/margins) biases selective; dialogue subtextual ("Will it work?") advances goal. Stable limited-POV, rhythm modulates quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image-charged sentences; figurative density pattern-taught for nostalgia payoff. Minor overwriting in opening arcade description slightly slows early propulsion, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chalk codes/mail as rebellion transforms dystopia tropes organically; lyric risk synthesizes nostalgia futurism, inevitable at hindsight closure without gimmick.</comment>
