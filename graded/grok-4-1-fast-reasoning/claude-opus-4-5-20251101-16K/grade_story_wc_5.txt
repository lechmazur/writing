<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to map grandmother's heart via alchemy is rooted in embodied patience ("understood it in her shoulders... breath... hands"), driving micro-choices like slow movements. Internal endurance shows contradiction between urgent search and glacial waiting, earned without epiphanies. Final walk forecloses aimless waiting with cost of scattering patterns. Minor lack of simultaneous impulses acting caps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from patterns and starlight pour to map revelation ("lines began to appear... pulsed gently"), with CR closure as rhythms match and she walks the path. Orientation anchored early (crater orchard, alchemist). Cost legible in "patterns... seal... before the wind scattered them." Lens holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard vividly selective (frost-blackened fruit, bone-white limbs), constraining via cold-forced patience and supplying discarded items for patterns. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's glacial focus. Final scattering charges image, mirroring internal release. Environment shapes ritual choice throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find grandmother via ritual) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pour/press ("light sank... lines began to appear"), narrowing to path discovery. Agency in patient setup forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in three-year wait and pattern dispersal. No reversal needed under lens; tightening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patience as cartography emerges organically from heart-map match ("rhythms matched") and final walk, reweighting prior waiting without moral. Subtext in grandmother's belief interleaves with ritual. Resonance in scattering patterns answers "hearts recognize" non-literally. Complexity lingers in aurora's stir.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of stillness ("patience settle into her muscles"). Voice texture rhythmic and biased (glacier breath, flash-paper). No head-hopping; diction modulates from deliberate to exhaled release. Prose reflects embodied patience under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "poured... pressed... closed her eyes" sequence). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors consistent (bruised sky, clawing limbs). Minor simile density in opener integrated into voice. Clean grammar propels to crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, starlight, heart-maps transforms lost-grandmother trope via physical patience. Premise (translate heartbeats) inevitable from particulars, risks lyric accumulation. Final path/scattering feels earned, no hedging. Bold conceptual integrity elevates.</comment>
