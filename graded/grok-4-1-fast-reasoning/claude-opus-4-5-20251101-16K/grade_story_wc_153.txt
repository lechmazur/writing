<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is embodied and particular (spirit wounds aching, throat tightening), with contradictory pride/silence driving micro-choices like evoking spirits and laying her letter. Final renunciation earned via causal buildup of messages mirroring her flaws. No safety-hedging; fierce ambiguity preserved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory/spirit messages builds to CR closure in letter dissolution and shard planting, with legible emotional cost in release. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Cost vivid in "ink bleeding into the brackish flow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove roots/condensation constrain choices (alcove stop, shard hold) and charge final image (letter claimed, shard planted). Sensory hierarchy (slick feet, singing shift) reflects medium's bias; evolves causally with humidity/messages. Micro-setting (shard, wounds) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why unsent letters) signaled early, tightens via spirit messages narrowing to mutual pride/cost realization. Agency in evocation and letter-laying forecloses silence path; felt price in tears/vulnerability undeniable under accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in initial want vs. need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect apologies emerges via particulars (messages, her letter bleeding), reweighting silence as shared tenderness without moralizing. Final image ("words that looked like *begin again*") offers non-literal resonant answer. Complexity lingers in "wasn't certain" doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature watery/spirit-tinged ("silver ribbons," "brackish flow"). Rhythm modulates with intensity; elision of backstory anchored to shard cues present choices. Spoken lines natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in messages, flowing descriptives elsewhere); no loops/artifacts. Figuratives consistent (water forgiveness motif) without muddle. Propulsion peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove spirits' condensation messages transform grief into mutual release via shard/letters. Bold lyric risk (ethereal communication) heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
