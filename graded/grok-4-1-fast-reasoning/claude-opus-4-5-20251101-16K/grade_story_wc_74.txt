<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's methodical persistence amid insomnia and skepticism creates earned endurance, with contradictory hope and isolation acting in her painting routine. Interiority embodied in brush sensations and wakeful acceptance. Final renunciation of sleep as cost feels character-particular, rooted in three-year arc converging on kindness realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of symbols and daydreams tightens toward CR closure in canvas as kindness monument, reweighting premise with felt endurance cost ("She would not sleep tonight either, but that was alright"). Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/moon setup; one deepening via "rouse something different" narrows to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse/plants constrain easel positioning and filter smog, charging final image where it "breathed around her, alive and patient." Sensory hierarchy (moonlight on brush, tomato vines humming) reflects Mira's priorities, mirroring internal saffron quiet without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of brush-as-object guides choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation proving kindness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via new daydream, forcing stance crystallization in acceptance of insomnia cost. One tightening reweights options toward "methodical hope made visible." Pressure coheres without reversal overload, cost legible in ongoing wakefulness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rippling kindness emerges implicitly from brush gift, lost symbols, and canvas monument, with final image ("it remembered") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting stranger's trust. Subtext in daydream of old woman teaching child avoids moralizing; ambiguity in language preservation lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (light "like water held in a cupped hand," saffron threads) modulates rhythmically, stable third-person limited POV. Syntax reflects Mira's quiet intensity, compression purposeful in daydream elisions paid off at realization. No head-hopping; diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere in light/water/saffron pattern without muddle, varying rhythm in peak painting beat. Minor simile density ("birds taking flight, mountain ranges") purposeful, not obscuring closure image of cleaning brush. No loops; precise verbs anchor action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magical realist brush transforms lost languages trope into kindness ripple proof, fresh synthesis of refugee gift and insomnia ritual. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically; final canvas reconfigures preservation as relational endurance, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
