<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices like tracing chalk and mapping coordinates, embodied in her quickened heart and rushed actions. Interiority feels particular through map-as-conversation worldview, with endurance of isolation as earned cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak discovery keeps it from 9+; no safety-hedging in her competent isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries densify from hopscotch (inciting) to starling confirmation to beam direction (climax), reconfiguring marooned stasis into charged poise at helm. Orientation anchored early via porthole/starlings. Closure's Charged Poise legible in "clutched to her chest... set course," with isolation cost felt against promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Airship's mirror array constrains escape choice; starling murmurations recur to charge final parting image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selectivity (amber dusk, pulsing glow) filters via cartographer's eye, evolving with action. Hopscotch board as micro-setting guides pivotal correlation moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape via discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern revelations narrowing to coordinates/engine revival. Agency in directing beam forecloses stagnation with isolation cost persisting. Escalation coherent under lens, but single deepening suffices without micro-turn penalty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sociable isolation theme emerges organically from map conversations and child/captain echoes, reweighted in final "sociable isolation... exactly where she was meant to be." Starling river image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like phrasebook avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via "maps were conversation partners," modulating rhythm with pressure (e.g., "heart quickened" to helm poise). Compression purposeful, diction biased toward geometries/murmurations. No head-hopping; elision of crew enhances isolation texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "Their patterns matched... drawing the numbers" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety in short gasps vs. flowing descriptions; no loops, metaphors coherent (light as blade). Minor flourish density in opening fits accumulative teaching without overwriting peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch-to-pi coordinates ingeniously synthesizes mundane/childish with navigational genius, transforming airship tropes via luminance physics. Starling confirmation adds non-obvious nature echo. Risky lyric poise heightens isolation stakes organically.</comment>
