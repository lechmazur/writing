<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical precision and imaginative curiosity act in the awakenings sequence, earning the final brush choice with visible cost in altered restoration. Interiority particular through talisman rubbing and story-imagining. No diagnostic labels; embodied in sound rearrangement through her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of nested awakenings tightens from clap to five layers, landing CR closure in nickel offering and changed gaze at cracks. Orientation anchored early in amphitheater setup. Cost legible in "didn't need certainty anymore," reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains via parabolic dishes bending claps into bewitchment, charging final hum. Hobo nickel as recurring object mirrors internal shift in placement at base. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant, filtered through restorer's playful ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled in talisman rub and question; accumulative deepening through nested layers narrows to embrace wonder, with agency in "she would look." Escalation tightens pressure coherently without reversal overload; cost in foreclosed erasure of cracks charges ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges implicitly from nickel carving to sound echoes to cracks-as-art; final image non-literally answers "who made you?" via honored cracks. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from exchange motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in "stories where others saw only peeling paint"; rhythmic control modulates from methodical lists to tumbling awakenings. Minimal dialogue natural ("You restore..."); no head-hopping, inference modest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "clapping once, then listening as the sound bounced... strange"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor abstract phrasing ("rearranging something she couldn't name") purposeful, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic garden + nested murals transforms restoration trope via sound-as-bewitchment; risk in surreal awakenings heightens stakes, inevitable in "pause between question and reply" CR. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
