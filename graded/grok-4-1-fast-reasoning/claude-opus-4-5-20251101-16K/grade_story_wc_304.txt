<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Singular motivation to capture sparks roots all micro-choices credibly, embodied in reading the face and softening mind; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments build density to Charged Poise/CR closure in chip's eternal chorus and Vera's endless path; cost legible in "forever listening for patterns in the static of ending things."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora and grotto constrain launch ledge choice and charge final image of body dissolving into light; sensory details (humming walls, burial winds) filter through Vera's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of spark capture tightens via faster fragments against encroaching dark under accumulative lens; agency in method earns quiet deepening with felt endurance cost of boundary work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of dignifying death emerges organically from infusion and release; final chip image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting light's preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with watchful perceptual signature ("colors she had no names for") stable in third-limited POV; rhythm modulates intensity purposefully without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulatively; no loops or artifacts, rhythmic control peaks clean in infusion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious premise transforms mortuary rite into aurora-bound spark harvest; risk-taking in lyric world logic heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
