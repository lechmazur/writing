<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with doubt about "constructing meaning from coincidence" revealing embodied conflict; naming "Sera" earns closure via prior causal motivation. Micro-choices like brush from hair show hierarchy of values with cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: narrative threads build density to garden discovery; closure as Charged Poise in painting "Sera" with legible emotional cost ("something had finally been released"). Orientation anchored early (Mira at prow, ship history). One tightening suffices via descent/escalating hints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (rust/brine smells, groaning wheel) filters through Mira's priorities, constraining descent and charging final image (paint can in debris enables naming). Carousel mirrors and name-wall as micro-setting mirror internal multiplicity. No white-room; purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acknowledge twin) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via logbooks to wall; agency in descent/painting forecloses isolation path with felt internal cost. Pressure coheres without reversal need; final release narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring forgotten emerges organically from garden wall and naming, reweighting "halved" self via final image (carries multitudes); resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like emerald reprise avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mist as "ghostly fingers"); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in descent). Prose texture distinct, biased noticing (ship's "aberrant freedom"). No head-hopping; elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., sway/groan propulsion); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion aligns with beats; closure image sharp ("warmth that didn't burn but simply... held"). Zero artifacts in peak naming beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera twin + name-wall garden transforms abandonment trope; risk in drifting-ship frame heightens trapped stakes organically. Naming "Sera" inevitable from blood-hum, no derivative echoes.</comment>
