<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—chest ache of truth vs. stubborn refusal—act in scene through cog-handling and wall-carving, earning stasis of preservation with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifact density tightens knowledge from cog to cache, landing CR closure in "calibrating patience against despair" with legible endurance cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sewer drip, grate light, sedimentary strata constrain hiding tactics and charge final work image, filtering through Vero's precision bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Preservation stake signaled early deepens via sediment proof under textural lens, agency in endurance forecloses assimilation with despair cost crystallized in final line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from cog/layers/bells; final brass-in-darkness image reweights premise of endurance-as-truth without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature on strata-as-stories and precision distinguishes voice; syntax rhythmically modulates reflective build to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; dense propulsion peaks in "brass teeth still sharp enough to cut," varying rhythm without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sediment-truth philosopher vs. narrative-erasure council synthesizes fresh post-plague ingenuity; quiet stasis risks bold resonance from particulars.</comment>
