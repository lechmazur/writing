<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect defiance compels the seed distribution as earned stance crystallization; charming smile and cryptic speech reveal under pressure without stock phrasing. Group secondaries apply relevant pressure via roles (cartographer's reveal). Minor slip: limerick girl's whisper borders generic, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from garden signals to seed plan; orientation anchored by ~100 words (Mira in greenhouse post-tax year). Closure as CR in final handoff and "chaos converges" line reweights taxable thoughts with conceptual cost of risky planting; persistent seed constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse specifics (pinned butterflies, misted terrariums, luna moth) constrain via cover and charge final image of emergence mirroring rebellion. Sensory hierarchy (humid air confession, rattling seeds) filters through Mira's priorities; setting guides scattering exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist emotional taxation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Phase Three reveal narrowing to seed barriers. Agency in Mira's plan forces trade-off (risk exposure for sanctuary); cost felt in palpable fear and desperate beauty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grown defiance emerges via plant signals, gourd vibrations, moth unfolding; final "seeds waited like promises" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting inner ownership without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature ("speak in blooms"); voice rhythms modulate (short grounding rattle sentences amid poetic swells). Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("candidly cryptic"); distinct from Vasquez's peering reserve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "humid air pressed like a confession" advances atmosphere/motif); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite: clustered growing metaphors verge muddle in plan explanation, but cohere without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cognitive dystopia via plant semiotics transforms tropes organically; risk in garden code specificity heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable CR of "roots don't file reports."</comment>
