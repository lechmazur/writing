<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion culminate in earned forgiveness at closure ("forgiveness for her mother, for herself"), rooted in pacifist traits that compel silence-cataloging under pressure. Contradictory impulses act in scene: scientific pursuit vs. intuitive feeling, revealed via recorder entries. Minor diagnostic labels in cataloging ("Category: abandonment") feel slightly over-articulated but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where Vera releases cataloging ("Some silences... were meant to be felt"), with legible emotional cost in tucking diary away. Orientation anchored early (workshop, diary). Single tightening via "deeper" frequencies narrows to personal recognition without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop with machines and skylight constrains choices (tuning antenna) and charges final image (fireworks light "painting the shadows"). Sensory details selective via POV (hum of tubes, needle twitch). Recurring diary as micro-setting evolves to tactile hold at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover mother's path to empathy via silences) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening frequencies to closure reconfiguration. Agency in tuning forecloses cataloging path with felt cost (life's work "transformed"). Fireworks contrast tightens external pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via silence emerges organically from particulars (silence varieties), reweighted non-literally at end ("loving anyway") without moralizing. Final image resonates, tying path to forgiveness with conceptual cost of incomplete understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (frequencies as feelings). Prose texture rhythmic and biased (emotional silences cataloged intuitively). Minor register elevation in labels ("Subcategory: relief mixed with sorrow") but consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; "silence" repetitions pattern-taught as motif without loops. Varied syntax propels to fireworks climax. Slight figurative density ("stars peered through like curious witnesses") but coherent; no scaffold or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-collection via frequencies transforms pacifist premise into emotional science, with risk-taking in accumulative catalog risking sentimentality but paying off in charged release. Ingenuity peaks in "frequencies told her everything," inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
