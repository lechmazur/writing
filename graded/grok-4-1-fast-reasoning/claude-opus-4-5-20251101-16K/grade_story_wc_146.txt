<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bell tuner's motivation clear and consistent but lacks embodied contradictory impulses in scene; townsfolk passive archetypes without micro-choices revealing flaws. Mayor confrontation hints at pressure but stays surface-level. No deep interiority undermines single-POV default depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from silence to harmonious revival with legible time-shard transitions. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via solstice ringing and self-tuning realization, cost legible in "before the collapse" timing ("Revivals must begin before the final breath"). Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway as acoustic "bones" constrain choices (footstep rhythms map, sing back) and charge final promenades; sensory hush-to-hum purposeful. Architecture mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Recurrent archway evolves from entry to revival frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town's death vs. harmony) signaled early; textural escalation via patient mapping, tuning, promenades narrows to solstice payoff with agency in tuner's endurance. Cost felt in near-collapse timing; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of self-restored balance emerges from particulars (footsteps weave rhythm); final widow line resonates as CR without overt moralizing. Subtext in architecture's memory invites ambiguity on external aid. No tidy binary, complexity in dying-then-growing town.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person voice with poetic rhythm modulating hush-to-song; perceptual signature collective but biased to acoustic urgency. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("I tune bells"); no head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (tap-tap-tap echoes pattern); high density weaves action/atmosphere sans loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (town as instrument); propulsion matches beats without overwriting in peak solstice ring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: town-as-instrument revived via footsteps transforms ghost-town trope organically. Risky fable structure heightens stakes; final self-tuning reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
