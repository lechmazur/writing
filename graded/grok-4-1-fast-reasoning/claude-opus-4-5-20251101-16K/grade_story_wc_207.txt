<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in her psychometry gift and petrichor belief, compelling the climactic swim with embodied wonder; interiority shines in the "hinged awakenings" vision, revealing character-particular contradiction between knowledge-seeking and surrender. No other characters limit relational tests. Minor slip: eccentricity feels slightly told rather than fully complicated by cost until end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to CR closure—Mira sheds "boots, her coat, her lantern" and swims, reweighting explanations with felt cost of forsaken ties; compass vision pays off expedition setup without breaks. Orientation anchors early (factory silence, descent). Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Limestone "frozen prayers" and "black and mirror-still" lagoon constrain the swim and charge final pulse of light; sensory hush "press[es] against her eardrums," mirroring internal threshold. POV-filtered details evolve purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanations-fail threshold) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through psychometry reversal changing knowledge of expedition, forcing swim agency with on-page cost of abandoned tethers. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-over-knowledge emerges via compass visions shifting to "experience of wonder itself," final image reconfiguring premise without moralizing; resonant hush callbacks avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in petrichor/storm essences and cavern textures; rhythm modulates from hush to "warm as blood" embrace under pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm—"resonant hush" recurs purposefully without loops; figurative "hinged awakenings" coherent in peak vision beat. Minor overwriting in opening factory simile slightly blurs propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry-expedition synthesis transforms cave trope into transcendence via spinning compass; risk of quiet CR ending heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
