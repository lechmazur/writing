<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "not trying to win... only trying to understand," earning the self-forgiveness with prior causality via bleeding fingers and dedicated work; embodied emotion concrete throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to tapestry shimmer and village revival as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in "trembling" post-pull; orientation anchored early in arrival scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via frayed threads and dim light forcing finger-work; thunder bookends charge final rain image, mirroring internal thaw; micro-setting (tapestry) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (untangle for understanding) tightens via stalemate realization, narrowing to final thread-pull with agency; cost felt in bodily toll and unresolved past, charging ending under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grace-chosen forgiveness emerges organically from puzzle-work to "small mercy" realization; final rain image non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature filters via chess-pattern lens ("seventeen moves ahead"); rhythmic control peaks in terse "The dog landed. The child laughed."; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "fingers bled. Her eyes burned" doing triple duty; varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; propulsion aligns with scene calm-to-release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess stalemate as time-unfreeze puzzle transforms redemption trope; risk in timeless "weeks" heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
