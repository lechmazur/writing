<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's tranquilly perceptive trait drives consistent micro-choices like reading the scavenger's clues and halting his confession; scavenger's greed-to-grief shift earned via embodied tremor and band detail, foreclosing theft with felt cost of carrying silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via ghosts' rituals and dialogue, culminating in Charged Poise CR where scavenger departs reconfigured ("carrying his unspoken words like precious cargo"), cost legible in honored grief vs lost sale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oasis micro-setting constrains via dry channels and ghosts pressuring scavenger's startle; stained glass box as recurring object charges closure hum, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve silence) signaled early, deepens via scavenger's near-confession tightening to refusal; agency in Elara's "Don't" forecloses path, cost felt in scavenger's complex grief recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence's eloquence emerges via ghosts' rituals and box's hum; final image ("Some things mattered precisely because they were never voiced") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (contextual clues bias); dialogue subtextual ("That weight is yours") pursues goals, distinct rhythms (Elara serene, scavenger abrupt).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in lines like "hands forever performing the rituals of harvest and smoke"; varied rhythm propels, no loops/artifacts, sensory integration woven into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic ghosts as unsaid words in beekeeping oasis transforms tropes; covenant premise risks bold conceptual integrity, heightening stakes via mute rituals.</comment>
