<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied (cold as texture); ritual micro-choices earn endurance with heresy cost legible in shadow refractions; motivation compels defiance without rational tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via echo density to crystal CR (Charged Poise in sphere against heart, cost of known punishment); orientation anchored early; single scene tightens once at last thread without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow/prism constrain ritual choices and charge final image (footprints erased vs. persistent echoes); sensory hierarchy poetic yet selective; micro-setting (threads/spool) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy conformity via harvest) signaled early, tightens texturally in untangling with visible cost (heresy risk); agency in preservation forecloses burial path under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of whispered resistance emerges from particulars (amber greed, violet gladness); final tuck reweights lullaby dissonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in serene patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (textures, echoes as colors/sounds); rhythmic modulation in sanctuary; stable close-third POV with lyric compression taught early and legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but figurative density in ritual beat (most sentences) dulls without full pattern payoff; minor synonym loops (snow erasure); rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh chaste courtesan premise transformed via echo harvest/prism; risk in heresy poise heightens stakes organically; inevitable synthesis of ritual and revolution in hindsight.</comment>
