<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied details like trembling hand tracing condensation and dry wit in "editing your obituary," earning the final commitment; subtle confidence constrains colleagues but drives micro-choices without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses (relief vs. worry in stillness) act simultaneously, fulfilling 9+ test. Minor flaw: internal conflict leans more obsessive endurance than raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: falcon message → translation → condensation pattern tightens to Charged Poise closure as she steps out, phrasebook in hand, with outpost groan as felt cost. Orientation anchored early (outpost, frozen lake). 9+ test met: lens coherent, persistent constraint (north directive) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain choices (ice holds weight for journey); condensation pattern as micro-setting charges realization and door recall. Sensory hierarchy (frost, steam) reflects cartographer's eye; worrying tranquility mirrors internal push. 9+ test: recurring glass motif constrains and recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach convergence) signaled early, escalates via density (falcon → message → pattern) under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in packing/committing. Cost legible in "worrying quiet" and groan warning, charging final step. Enters 8.8 via trade-off (leave safety), but lacks one deeper reversal beyond signs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of water's hidden origins emerges organically from particulars (Evenki message, condensation map), reweighted in final image of ice/silence without moralizing. Resonance from irony: maps miss truth she chases. 9+ test: non-literal answer in her forward walk reconfigures cartographic premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (geographic precision in "every mapped river"); voice modulates dryly ("water wants editorial control") to charged poise at end. Rhythmic control heightens tranquility tension; no elision issues. 9+ test: distinct signature under pressure, clean distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "droplets...traced lines. Tributaries" integrates image/action without loops; rhythm varies (short punchy mutters vs. flowing descriptions). Minor simile density ("wings cutting like a rumor") purposeful for textural lens, no muddle in peak (condensation beat). 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms quest trope via water's agency (condensation map, Evenki omen), with falcon/scout as fresh synthesis; risk in subtle supernatural (signs without explanation) heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from atlas backstory. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability, risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
