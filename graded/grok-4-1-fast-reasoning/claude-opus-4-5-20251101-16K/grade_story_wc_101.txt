<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's gentle persistence is embodied in micro-choices like noticing absences and redirecting supplies without words; contradictory impulses surface in her understanding the young's declaration urge yet renouncing it. Bekir applies targeted pressure via his doubts, forcing her stance. Final renunciation earned by observed intergenerational acts, with visible cost of delayed visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gathering to distribution to Bekir exchange, culminating in Charged Poise RR where Mira forecloses declaration path. Cost legible in "invisibility was exhausting" echo and final gaze holding moonlight commitment. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with fluid movement fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor frames start/end, constraining solitude/reflection and charging closure image; dusk "bruised purple" valley mirrors exile's bruise, narrowing to rocky paths and shed darkness that enable secrecy. Sensory hierarchy (visual dusk/quiet, tactile climb) reflects Mira's priorities. Arbor as recurring micro-setting alters tactics by elevating oversight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secret endurance vs. pride/declaration) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via mother-elder exchange and Bekir's probe; Mira's agency in "not yet" renunciation narrows options with felt cost of ongoing sanctions. One tightening via talk of young ones coheres pressure without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of roots outlasting exile emerges organically from shared darkness and silent redirects, reweighted in final image of gifts "harder to name." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in declaration deferral's cost. Intergenerational motif constrains without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in persistent noticing (names, absences); rhythmic prose modulates quiet intensity. Dialogue subtext-heavy ("How long?" vs. "We last"), distinct voices (Bekir's audible doubt). No head-hopping; diction fits Mira's literary past.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., bell's note "amplif[ies] the quiet"). Varied rhythm accelerates in procession, breathes in exchanges; minor "gently persistent" reprise purposeful, no loops. Opening anchors stakes via climb/bell; final echo propels closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions exile via midnight runs and bell transforms aid trope into secretive family forge. Risk in accumulative quiet build heightens endurance stakes; "bruised purple" valley particularizes without ornament.</comment>
