<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rediscover joy roots deeply in her grief-dimmed gift, with embodied interiority peaking in the hand-warming pulse from the fresco. Contradictory impulses—routine vs. longing—act simultaneously as she touches the fragment, compelling the painting choice with visible cost of ongoing creation. Final endurance of daily repainting feels earned by her inherited trait's revival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building density of light-visions and network revelations, with orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mira in Pale Orchard). One tightening: fresco pulse reveals network, enabling fog-painting. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "joy wasn't something she'd find like a dropped coin," with conceptual cost of perpetual effort legible in glowing hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and orchard constrain choices, holding memories until her light develops them like film; sensory hierarchy (warmth, pulsing, luminous fruit) filters through artist's bias. Setting evolves causally (thins as she paints), mirroring internal dimming-to-vividness. Final thinning fog charges closure image, reconfiguring ruin as waiting preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment's warmth deepening to network-fed visions that force painting agency. One reversal: secret gift reactivates under fog-pressure, narrowing to endurance with cost of impermanent murals ("flicker and shift"). Stakes viscerally felt in laughter's "sorrow and delight," charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile joy's preservation emerges organically from light-seeds and network, reweighted in CR: orchards waited like exposed film. Final image (glowing hands, thinning fog) offers non-literal answer without moralizing, resonating via pensive laughter's shift from grief. Subtext in fog-breathing approval embraces ambiguity of temporary vividness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with painterly perceptual signature (light "like water," fog "holds" images). Rhythm modulates from pensive to vivid in painting beat, with purposeful lyric compression taught early. Diction reflects Mira's idiom ("pensive mirth," "exposed film"), heightening pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (e.g., "light gathered, pale gold and trembling") with no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak painting ("murals that shifted like living things") risks slight overwrites but patterns as voice-motivated. Rhythm varies for ear, clarity intact at closure's glowing fingertips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms mural artist trope via time-spanning light-network and fog-preserved memories, with fresh CR on joy-as-daily-creation. Ingenuity in "painting on the fog itself" feels inevitable from fresco seed. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
