<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in decoding signals drives consistent micro-choices like selecting wire "third row, seventh slot"; embodied emotion in "fingertips still warm from the copper wire." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of repair details builds to Charged Poise/CR closure in final image of Maren waiting amid depot rhythms and ship's horn, reweighting repair vs. departure with conceptual cost of preserved "invisible threads." Orientation anchored early in mist-coated depot and Aurora event; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist and water refraction constrain her drone-mediated perception, charging choices like detecting cylinder fracture; recurring depot transience mirrors internal state purposefully. Micro-setting (hummingbird drone as tool) shapes final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of precise repair amid departure tightens accumulatively through drone feedback and wire patching, narrowing options with blindness tradeoffs; cost legible in "stories heavier than their mechanisms" and patient isolation vs. crowd cheers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair anchoring transience emerges implicitly from music box waltz coinciding with ship's horn, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; final image recharges particulars like mist and depot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature of "decoding what light reveals when it bends through moisture"; rhythmic control modulates calmly under low pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor repetition of "decode" motif purposeful but borders loop without obscuring closure. No artifacts dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan using refraction-sensing drone transforms repair trope; risk in perceptual POV heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via drone's shoulder settlement.</comment>
