<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in guilt's "teeth gnawing," culminating in earned renunciation when she places the watch hand; contradictory impulses (justifications vs. feeling full weight) act simultaneously before closure. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to sifting to discovery, closure as CR in final image of objects resting together with felt emotional cost ("heavy as the watch hand"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via carving find pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings constrain search choice and charge final image; cobalt dusk evolves causally ("sky bled indigo," "failing light") mirroring internal state. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (reading etchings like documents).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront erasure's cost) signaled early, deepens via carving's question forcing stance crystallization; agency in sifting/placing forecloses justifications with on-page emotional price under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured pasts vs. withheld truths emerges organically; final image non-literally answers carving's question, reweighting premise without moralizing—"tempered regret was enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (genealogist warping photos/reading carvings); rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak sift, diction biased to fabrication metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "guilt had teeth, and hers had been gnawing"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propulsion matches scene cadence to quiet closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist-as-unmaker with driftwood memorials transforms erasure trope; quiet CR risks bold poignancy, inevitable in hindsight from early "sieved hush."</comment>
