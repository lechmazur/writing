<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in flake's heat versus calculated risks; renunciation earned by chamber mirrors reflecting potential sovereign self, with visible cost of sunrise deadline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (peeling to map to descent) culminating in CR closure: kneeling reconfigures ascension as service, cost legible in dawn light filtering as time expires.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall spray and biolum fruit constrain entry/peeling urgency; oldest tree bedrock stairs and dawn channels charge final gold-painted chamber image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ascension claim) signaled early, tightens via time pressure narrowing descent options; agency in peeling/renunciation forecloses dominion path with sunrise cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of service over dominion emerges organically from flake test and mirrors; final kneeling image offers non-literal answer reweighting power premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scanner hum, peeler precision); rhythmic diction modulates from urgent peeling to poised chamber realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "twentieth layer: a map rendered in pigments that still held their vibrancy"; varied syntax propels without loops, propulsion peaks in descent hours under deadline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh twist on throne quest via literal paint peels mirroring revelation; risk in descent reconfigures nostalgic return as service calling, synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
