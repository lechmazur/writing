<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's logical indexer traits drive concrete micro-choices like using the stamp, with embodied contradiction in "desperate precision" amid tranquility; final renunciation of mere indexing feels earned by revelation trail. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "tranquilly perceptive" slightly abstracts peak interiority without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from glow-enabled noticing to stamped revelations; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page when she stamps her page, reconfiguring purpose with dome-failure cost legible in "If she did not [survive]". Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae glow constrains perception, softening edges to reveal layers and charges final image alongside stamp; dome/ocean pressure subtly guides desperate indexing. Sensory hierarchy reflects indexer's priorities, vivid yet selective without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace origins signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered pages/stamp discovery narrowing to betrayal truth; agency in cross-referencing forecloses error hypothesis with blackout-time cost. One tightening sufficient, cost felt in uncertain pumps/dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth vs. machinery's drown-out emerges organically from glow revelation to stamped trail; final "pressed it to a fresh page, and began to write" offers resonant CR reweighting indexing as betrayal preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in page-thickness noticing; voice texture precise/reflective modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or elision withholding. Prose rhythm supports quiet accumulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful repetition of "stillness" teaches pattern charging closure. Propulsion clear, overwriting absent in peak revelation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken archive betrayal via hidden stamps transforms dystopian trope; "circle within a triangle" seal and algae glow feel inevitable, risking quiet CR over confrontation.</comment>
