<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore the labyrinth is rooted in specific traits like her weaving history and optimism, shown through concrete actions like mapping paths and sewing. Interiority is particular and embodied, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a pivotal on-page moment, leaning more declarative. Final endurance of council risk feels earned with felt personal cost in lifelong craft commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to final canopy completion, culminating in Charged Poise RR where labyrinth "breathes" and plate warms, reconfiguring ruin to hope with legible cost of isolation and precedent-breaking. Orientation anchors early (tide pools, descent). Single scene fits scope; no lens ambiguity or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth and tide pools constrain choices (access only post-drainage, convergence points as canvas); sensory details (salt patterns, stone dust, billowing canopies) filter through Mira's poetic bias and charge final image of rippling prayer. Red walls "like cupped palms" mirrors internal state purposefully. No white-room; evolved with her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via sewing at convergences) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to seventeenth canopy finish narrowing options (dawn approaches). Agency in micro-choices like final stitch forecloses decay path with felt risk cost (council descent). Pressure coheres under lens but lacks one sharper reversal beyond steady build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weaving ruin to reverence emerges organically from particulars (nets to canopies, sleepers' calm); final image of hoping labyrinth offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting forgotten sacredness without moralizing. Subtext in optimistic heart vs. warnings adds ambiguity. No tidy binaries; embraces decay's pull.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (cathedrals in ruins, hymns in wind) stable in close third, modulating rhythmically from descriptive build to charged poise. Compression purposeful and taught early; diction reflects poetic weaver idiom. No head-hopping; elision pays off in breathing labyrinth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion fits accumulative build to "indigo canopies ripple in sequence." Minor overwriting in metaphors (capillaries, breath) during setup but purposeful and non-muddled; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure image of "orchid solace."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalking paths as canvas, phosphorescent poetry canopies transforming decay; risk in breaking precedents heightens stakes organically. Labyrinth-weaving premise feels inevitable in hindsight via wharf background. No template tropes; bold lyric restoration angle.</comment>
