<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veris's fierce sympathy drives integration via concrete actions like sitting with Kael and holding Osen, earning her change with felt relational costs; minor slip in lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak scenes, but motivation intensifies credibly under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of tags and relationships building to CR closure in sculpture dedication, where "belonging was not a destination but a continuous act" reconfigures options with endless search cost; shards cohere with legible time elision, one tightening via Kael encounter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain expeditions (rope descents) and charge final image with prismatic shadows mirroring connection; sensory details like "light and fractured it into whispers of color" filter through Veris's sculptor bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting via shared search tightens accumulatively through expeditions trusting others, narrowing outsider status with grief-sharing costs; agency in sculpture peaks pressure coherently, though no single sharp reversal as lens favors density over causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of seeking as belonging emerges organically from tag hunts and sculpture web, resonant non-literal answer in final "ache of connection... endless as the search itself" reweighting prior losses; speech borders echo but anchors in concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in light-fracturing motifs; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven (Kael's revelation advances plot), rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful poetic diction (e.g., "cupped palm" orchard); minor scaffold in repetitive "trusting" phrasing patterned for emphasis, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world, crystal-reed sculpture, and Cartographer myth transforms community trope via lived searches; risk in elliptical time pays off in inevitable CR closure.</comment>
