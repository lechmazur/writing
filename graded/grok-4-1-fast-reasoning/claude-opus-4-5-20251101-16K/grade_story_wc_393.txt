<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's deliberate restraint and Eleanor's anger-to-acceptance arc earn the closure shift through relational crucible; contradictory impulses surface in her laugh and trembling hands before the music plays. Minor slip: limited interior contradiction shown directly in Marcus beyond proxy delivery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify to heart reveal and music box song (RR/Charged Poise); closure reconfigures her stance with felt emotional cost in "Tell me about him." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's "vibrant hush" and storm light constrain reveal, charging final image; clockwork heart as micro-setting evolves tactilely from tarnished to gleaming, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (does action redeem?) tightens via restoration reveal under accumulative lens, foreclosing her anger with visible emotional cost as melody rises; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Redemption-through-action emerges organically via restored heart and song; final image answers "deserve" question non-literally, reweighting her testimony with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization biases via Marcus's observations; dialogue subtextual ("An apology") advances stakes naturally, with distinct voices in terse priest vs. bitter shopkeeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("delicate, imperfect, alive"); minor overwriting in repeated "aptly deliberate" phrasing nudges down, but no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clockwork heart's penance restoration transforms redemption trope through mechanic's precision; fresh synthesis of prison craft and wedding heirloom feels inevitable at music box climax.</comment>
