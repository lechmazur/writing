<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (fear from follower vs. integrity in recording), earning the final refusal with visible cost; interiority concrete and particular, as in trembling hands steadying via courtyard anchors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of patterns tightening to Earned Stasis closure ("small stubborn flame of her refusal"); cost legible in "Let him" defiance against surveillance, on-page reconfiguration of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting (jasmine, fountain) constrains choice by anchoring tranquility amid threat and charges final image ("fountain sang its patient song"); selective sensory detail reflects POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. erasure) signaled early, escalates via lateral pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens, agency in renunciation forecloses path with felt cost ("man in the gray coat was writing his own report").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of solitary truth vs. imposed silence emerges organically, final image ("small stubborn flame") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior data patterns without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in precise, measured noticing (e.g., "progressing laterally through the evidence"); rhythmic control heightens pressure, POV stable and biased toward observational integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Ordinary numbers. Honest numbers."); zero loops, varied rhythm, no artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm data as quarantine proof transforms whistleblower trope; quiet refusal risks stasis for conceptual cost, inevitable in hindsight via lateral method.</comment>
