<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Intrepid pilot's micro-choices under inversion pressure (tilting glider into spray) reveal competence balanced by stakes-driven struggle; earned final renunciation of passive cure for active ritual shows interior contradiction resolving with cost. Solo POV limits relational crucible but delivers embodied emotion without clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via journey-echo-revelation to CR closure ("She would learn to forge new arrows"), reweighting blight as restorable cycle with fading arrow's conceptual cost legible in resonant final commitment; single scene holds without orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward rivers constrain navigation tactics (weaving between moss-crusted monoliths) and charge final image (arches holding breath); whirling silence evolves sensorily, mirroring internal shift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchards' resilience source) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through echoes' ritual revelation narrowing options to annual practice; agency in patient navigation forces stance crystallization with felt cost of arrow's fade and lost knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resilience-as-continuity emerges organically from arrow-echo-orchards interplay, final image ("memory itself, the resilience of continuity") reweighting premise without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity in ritual's revival invites reflection via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with pilot's perceptual bias (reading currents "like language"); rhythmic diction modulates from whirling silence to birdsong break, distinct texture without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (leaves rotating, stones drifting) with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm peaks in echo chorus without figurative muddle, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverting gravity, acoustic echoes, root-essence arrows transforms tropes into inevitable ritual revival; bold world logic (upward rivers as highways) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
