<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in drone analogy at revelation ("like a drone finding its signal after flying blind"); earned change from skepticism to alignment via micro-choices like aligning chip. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more sequential than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building (chip alignment to sphere reconfiguration); CR closure legible in "coordinates written in her bones" with felt displacement cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Armillary sphere and EMI walls constrain choices (drones dormant, manual search); recurring flowers charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sharp-eyed tracking); dusk "brilliant dimness" mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early; accumulative deepening via pattern emergence narrows displacement options with emotional cost in final alignment. Agency in pull/revelation forecloses stranger path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared belonging emerges organically from chip-sharing and pilgrim chain; final image reweights hoarding vs. bridge without moralizing. Resonant CR answers displacement via stellar geometry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alignments, trails as drone signals); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end. Lyrical diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "withered petals scattered... desperate hope"); varied rhythm, no loops though "perpetually surprised" recurs purposefully. Minor repetition in "brilliant dimness" contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech with celestial cipher transforms origin tropes; matrix chip as key/stellar paths non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens resonance.</comment>
