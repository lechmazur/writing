<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in disbelief legacy drives micro-choices like clutching the lattice and confessions; interiority concrete via father's wolf legacy anchoring present sins. Final step-through earns change by prior causal confessions foreclosing disbelief path. Subtle contradiction in lighter sins vs. inherited weight; no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via scuff marks, confessions bending mirrors to CR closure where Ezra enters belief-space, cost legible in abandoned world narrative ("they would find the bodies... compound deception"). Orientation anchored early ("lighthouse prison... Ezra understood accusations"). One tightening via hovering lattice suffices; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jagged reef, mirror-salt labyrinth constrain via scuff invitation and confession-bending paths; copperlight evolves from warming stone to bronze hush, charging final threshold image. Sensory selective (wet stone bodies, geometric shadows); POV-biased via desperate/curious lens. Micro-object lattice as setting enables core choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chase hush against disbelief/body discovery) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via confessions narrowing deceptive mirrors to truth-path; agency in speech forecloses inherited narrative. Timeframe pressure tightens tactics; cost felt in looming boats and sealed labyrinth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truth uninheritability) emerges via confession-images shifting from wolf-boy to "simply... man speaking truth"; final CR image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in hush as belief-space resonates via particulars, ambiguity in lighthouse's "sustained impossibilities."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: accusation-filtered noticing (scuffs as invitation, lattice shadows bending logic). Prose texture modulates rhythmically with intensity (declarative confessions amid poetic light shifts); no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "copperlight... warming the crumbling stone" advances setting/action/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety in light evolutions avoids monotony; minor copperlight repetition pattern-taught for tonal build, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: confessional lattice threading mirror-labyrinth transforms cry-wolf trope via lighthouse impossibilities, inevitable in hindsight; risk in surreal rules heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
