<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via color-matching ritual and embodied tremble at boat photo; contradictory grief (numbed yet vitalizing) acts in persistent climbs; final mixing earned by photo escalation, foreclosing pure photography with felt vitalization cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from palette matches to boat silhouette CR, reweighting loss as presence; orientation anchored by ~50 words (Mira, archive, Velas); cost legible in "luminous absence... shifted" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Palette/lighthouse ruins constrain daily ritual and charge boat photo; sensory hierarchy (dawn light over wind voices) filters via Mira's longing; whispers subtly guide eastward gaze, mirroring internal shift without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother reconnection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hue matches to silhouette reversal; agency in endurance photographing forecloses drowning belief; cost felt in presence replacing absence at climax photo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-light emerges via photos/palette recurrence, reweighting "cipher of longing" in boat image without statement; final mixing offers resonant answer to transformation question; ambiguity lingers in "improbable things became true."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light as paint, whispers as memory) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in final palette bloom; stable close-third POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "holding it against the horizon"); varied rhythm accelerates to "hands trembled"; no loops, metaphors consistent (light/voice/whisper).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography-as-painting transforms Color Pilgrimage trope into personal cipher; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via impossible boat, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
