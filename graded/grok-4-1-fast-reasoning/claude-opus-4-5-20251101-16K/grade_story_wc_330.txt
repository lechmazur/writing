<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between silence philosophy and singing impulse acts in the restoration beat; change earned by craft recognition in "craftsmanship spoke across decades."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from mist/trail entry to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "felt like four heartbeats" time shift and pocketed promise foreclosing pure silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train's rust/wildflowers/bells constrain entry and charge final gleam image; sensory hierarchy sharpens via carpenter's tactile bias on chipped paint/manes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-as-possibility tightens accumulatively via halo/discovery to singing agency; cost felt in unused voice muscles and time foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "something between" silence/speech emerges via particulars like reeds/creak rhythm; final gleam image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with carpenter-specific perceptual signature (sawdust/greasepaint); rhythmic modulation peaks at song without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (silence/chime); minor metaphor density in halo gleam beat ("whispering gleam... like something alive") risks slight overwrite but supports tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mute carpenter restoring circus halo transforms abandonment trope; singing turn inevitable from carved horses' "movement caught mid-stride."</comment>
