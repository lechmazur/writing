<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in decades of root-bound visions compels her exit and ritual leadership, with embodied contradictory emotions peaking in "anxious elation surge through her chest, a giddy terror." Final freedom as earned stasis forecloses prophetic purpose with felt cost of purposelessness. Secondary characters pressure via scars without diluting her drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: eclipse arrival → clipping cut → guided journey → glade ritual DC, with RR in covenant renewal and Mira's unbinding. Closure cost legible in "new maze would grow... she was free—unbound, purposeless." One tightening via others' arrival narrows to collective witness; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and viridian clipping constrain ritual and charge final sprouting image; sensory hierarchy (pulsing warmth, silver threads) reflects visionary urgency. Details like "twilight pooled like liquid sapphire" filter through Mira's bias, evolving with dusk to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew covenant or dreams scatter) signaled early, tightens via others' convergence forcing collective agency; cost in foreclosed isolation viscerally felt in flooding dreams. Climax ritual tests commitment with on-page threads anchoring sky/earth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared unconscious vs isolation emerges via intersecting dreams in ritual, resonant in final "memory of intersection" reweighting root-bound past. Subtext in scars/blood avoids statement; complexity in freedom's terror lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with visionary perceptual signature (e.g., "prophecy lifted slightly... new terror settled"); lyrical rhythm modulates from tangled visions to charged poise. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual in "We must heed," advancing plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "clipping pulsed... guiding her east"); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (vines/threads). No loops or artifacts; final line recharges spiral motif via sprouting roots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic maze, early eclipse, dream-intersection ritual transforms covenant trope via blood-scars and clipping; risk in quiet unbinding heightens stakes organically.</comment>
