<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—father's hunting legacy vs. her cultivation oath—act simultaneously in the flashback sheathing refusal and present teaching, earning her final endurance with visible cost in world's entropy. Interiority concrete via plant-sensing embodiment. Stranger applies light crucible pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tending to ballast-weaving to teaching spread, culminating in Charged Poise CR of dome rebellion image with conceptual cost of persistent chaos. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Ballast arrival provides one meaningful textural tightening reweighting continuity stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome's "engraved quiet" and "tranquil blaze" constrain choices by containing heat/chaos, mirroring internal stasis and charging final crystal silence image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: root tremors over prey. Roses as micro-setting evolve tactilely through cuttings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate continuity vs. chaos/violence) signaled early; textural deepening via ballast integration narrows to graceful carrying, forcing endurance renunciation with felt cost in tower's scatter and oath. Agency in weaving/teaching forecloses hunter path. Coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inculcated resilience vs. violence emerges via particulars (ballast-woven trays, rose teachings), final image non-literally answering cultivation's endurance without moralizing. Ballast motif shifts from wreckage to continuity, reweighting premise organically. Subtext in stranger's laugh tests but yields.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with perceptual signature: paradoxical phrasing ("tranquil blaze," "silence carved deliberately") biases toward roots/petals. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices (Mira's values vs. stranger's skepticism). Rhythm modulates intensity cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "Patience...You'll bloom" advances motivation/action). Varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative purposeful, not muddled (e.g., "scattered civilization like seeds"). Final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-tower pacifist inculcates values in plants using ballast for continuity, transforming survival tropes via quiet stasis. Risky lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick; dome rebellion inevitable from setup.</comment>
