<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through silence-perception and obsession with endings, shown in embodied care ("careful, so careful") when turning pages; endurance earned via prior mapping beats. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning declarative over conflicted micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to Charged Poise closure in final image of her "breathing with the rhythm of deepening silence," reconfiguring light's retreat as mapped testament; conceptual cost legible in flaking book and star's tremble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridge fort chamber and booklet as micro-setting constrain her tactile work ("gold flaked at every touch") and charge final image of page-turning; sensory details (wind screaming, star pulsing) mirror internal refusal to break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via star's pulses forcing final map section; agency in patient endurance, but pressure coheres mildly without sharp option-narrowing or trade-off in key beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing via absence emerges organically from flaking gold as coordinates and silences as shapes; final image resonant reconfiguration of night’s geography without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (gaps between waves, pauses as prophecy); rhythmic control in lyric compression heightens texture, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in varied syntax, purposeful silence motifs without loops obscuring cause; minor density dip from stacked metaphors ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") in late beats, but coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mapping darkness via flaking absences transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes of endurance, inevitable in final patient cartography.</comment>
