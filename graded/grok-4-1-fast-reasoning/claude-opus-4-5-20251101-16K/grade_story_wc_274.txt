<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied in trembling hands and hovering finger over key, with family memories anchoring present micro-choices; final renunciation of survival protocol earned through seven-year buildup, foreclosing flight with felt acceptance of capture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriented cleanly by anomaly flag in first paragraph; accumulative/textural lens holds as letter discovery deepens stakes to on-page DC (transmission press) with cost in waiting amid stacks; no lens ambiguity, closure image of networks waking reconfigures silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hexagonal stacks, gloved fingers on brittle page, and terminal glow constrain scanning/transmission choices; echoing quiet and eternal snow charge final image of library holding breath, mirroring internal thaw; sensory hierarchy (breath visible, depth pressure) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release vs. burial) signaled by protocol vs. mother/brother losses, tightens via knowledge change from letter to hover/press; agency in blink-moment act forecloses safety with legible cost of awaiting discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths forcing dialogue emerges organically from letter cascade to final networks awakening; resonant non-literal answer in "unspoken conversation finally beginning," reweighting suppression myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in "dizzying quiet pressed eardrums like depth pressure"; rhythmic modulation accelerates to "finger hovered...pressed it," reflecting stress without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("sleeping veins," "frozen words") integrated into action; varied syntax propels from quiet stacks to cascade spill, no loops or scaffolds; final line rhythm recharges snow motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryo-archive whistleblower trope via mapped networks and quiet revolution; bold charged poise ending transforms frozen stasis into awakening ripple, with risk in oblique cost paying off through inevitability.</comment>
