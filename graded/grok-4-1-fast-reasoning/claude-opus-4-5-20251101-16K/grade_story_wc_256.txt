<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's cultivated suspicion of "prescribed meaning" drives questioning micro-choices that earn epiphany; contradictory impulses surface in mandated pilgrimage vs. desire for "texture," culminating in weeping harmony with child's voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from courtyard expectation to lens-ringing discovery; CR closure reweights pilgrimage via on-page harmonizing voices with emotional cost ("Vera wept without shame").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Laboratory's resonance vaults and wax cylinders ground acoustic world; miner's lens as micro-setting distorts shadows and constrains ringing, charging final courtyard image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Suspicion vs. artificial ritual stake tightens via lens overtones "defy[ing] her training," deepening to realization; agency in repeated ringing forecloses doubt with bodily cost (weeping).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of textured connection emerges via lens harmonics bridging eras; final courtyard ringing non-literally reanswers "Why did she believe connection required living participants?" without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound-prism perceptual signature ("harmonics cascaded outward in fractal patterns") biases noticing; stable close-third POV modulates rhythmically to epiphany without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("tone fractured through the old glass"); sound metaphors cohere pattern-wise, but occasional figurative density ("paradox she had cultivated") borders overload pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism bells splitting sound like light and carbide lens capturing mine voices transform pilgrimage into temporal bridge; risk of lyric post-apoc sound-world pays off in harmonizing closure.</comment>
