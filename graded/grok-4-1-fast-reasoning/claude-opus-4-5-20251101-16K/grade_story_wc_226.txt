<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's defiant interiority shines in "truth, like light, could be refracted," rooting her motivation in consistent artistry that compels the final renunciation; Fen's innocence pressures without overshadowing. Contradictory impulses act in her poetry variations, earning the stasis of eternal remembering. No diagnostic speak; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry density builds to cadence shift in final decision to "disappear into the canyon," a Charged Poise RR with legible cost of "eternal wandering." Orientation anchored early via stairs/bones/window; single scene, no shards. Closure cost crystalized in "her echoes joining all the others who had refused."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone floors, endless echoes constrain choices by diffusing truths, charging final image of multiplying echoes; mist-softened spire recurs to frame ritual pressure. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Mira notices bones underfoot, spire through mist). No white-room; lived-in via climbing, pausing, sitting among remnants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth vs. precision) signaled early, deepens via poetry session under Accumulative lens, narrowing to defiance; agency in performance/renunciation forecloses forgiveness path. Cost felt in "eternal wandering, eternal remembering." Moral calculus between multiplicity and absolution sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness's price emerges organically from refracted confessions, resonating in final image of defiant echoes without moralizing; reweights premise via "defiance... its own kind of art." Complexity lingers in refusal's cost, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (artistic refraction lens); voice rhythmic, modulating from hush to echoing lift. Fen's dialogue distinct ("Tell us something"), goal-driven, subtext-laden. No head-hopping; diction biased to Mira's defiance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm ("words fell like stones... strengthening with each variation"); no loops, artifacts, or muddled figs. Final line recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear perfect, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of confession ritual via poetic refraction in bone-echo world; defiance as art transforms trope of guilt. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no template echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
