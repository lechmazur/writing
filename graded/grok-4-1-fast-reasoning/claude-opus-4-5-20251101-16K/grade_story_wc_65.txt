<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (soaring imagination dragged by pragmatism) act in scene through embodied freeze (tracing ice fractals) and compel the final lift of the nib; change earned by insight into silence as failure. Interiority particular and concrete, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of futures/models builds to faint thread insight, delivering Charged Poise/CR closure as nib descends with legible cost ("greater failure was silence") reconfiguring paralysis into action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and spire constrain (mirror her state, ancient failure warns) and charge final thaw image; selective sensory (crystallizing breath, refracting dawn) filters through cartographer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (precise 7 words or scatter/doom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via faint thread sighting that forces renunciation of perfection; agency in choosing silence's cost charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sustaining transformation emerges from quill lineage/models/ice; final thaw/nib descent offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior paralysis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (probabilities "wash through," fractals traced) with rhythmic control; diction modulates intensity to charged closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines integrate image/action/insight); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ignorance cartography premise synthesizes fresh angle on innovation; risk in quiet CR closure (thaw seeding endless change) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
