<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in "steely longing tempered by loss into something unbreakable," with micro-choices like playing a new melody revealing values; earned endurance forecloses return to silence with felt cost in aching arms. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as music pulses clouds and steadies compasses toward RR closure (clock chimes, arbor halts) with legible cost in persistent play beyond dusk; orientation anchored early in arbor description; single tightening via compasses pointing upward suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "vines of silver and glass" and compasses constrain intention-driven choices and charge final image of parted clouds revealing station; sensory selection (light, pulsing clouds) mirrors internal states through action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surprise fate via encore before descent) signaled early and tightens accumulatively as music elicits world response, narrowing to endurance with on-page cost (arms ache); agency in playing drives escalation, but abstract "surprise fate" slightly mutes visceral edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "music against silence" emerges organically from particulars like frozen clock and pulsing clouds, with final image of ticking clock offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss as enduring love; no moralizing, ambiguity in "invitation" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("harmonies where others heard discord"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "The first note rang out... clear as a bell struck in an empty cathedral," with varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("light older than the sun") borders overwriting but serves voice without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of film portal, intention-compasses, and music-rewriting time transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric ascent to morning encore feels inevitable from established particulars, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
