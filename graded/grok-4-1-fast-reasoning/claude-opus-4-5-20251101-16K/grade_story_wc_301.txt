<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via river mapping of grief and embodied post-medication shake; contradictory impulses in work-over-hospital choice shown through notebook actions. Diagnostic label-speak ("daringly methodical") slips slightly but anchors in micro-choices without flattening closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from platform emptiness to graffiti discovery to final realization; CR closure in "carry her guilt differently now, not as a wound... but as sediment" reconfigures mapping premise with felt emotional cost legible in waypoint image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and graffiti strata vividly selective, mirroring internal ruin-to-garden shift; dust motes "like river sediment" charges final image, constraining solitude and charging closure without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant forgiveness stake signaled early via notebook; graffiti deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization in "walking the distance" with on-page cost of ongoing guilt as sediment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient persistence emerges organically from river/maps/graffiti particulars; final image non-literally answers mapping's limits ("Forgiveness is just the map"), reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in river-filtered noticing (ivy rustle, bellows wheeze); rhythmic control modulates from raw fog-lift to charged poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful river metaphors; minor repetition ("methodical") patterned, not looping; propulsion clean in graffiti trace to platform realization, no scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-chronicling via rivers/graffiti/bellows remnant transforms introspection trope; risk in raw-medication edge heightens stakes organically to charged eastbound walk.</comment>
