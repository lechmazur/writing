<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in seed-collecting patience shines in her hour-long wait on the crate; fisherman's recognition adds crucible pressure. Minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong, not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from fulgurite reveal to rope decoding; charged poise closure in "Maren held the fulgurite glass... human memory" reconfigures preservation with felt cost of world's burial under snow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden dock, fog, snow constrain patience and charge final image of "fog embraced the golden dock"; sensory hush mirrors internal hush, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation tightens accumulatively via hour's wait forcing dialogue; cost of time/death of weavers legible, but lacks deeper agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Preservation theme emerges organically from knots/seeds, resonant in final dual-memory image reweighting chaos-to-form without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias toward patterns ("syntax of tension and release"); dialogue subtextual, distinct idioms advance stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene hush, high density in knot decoding; minor fog/snow repetition purposeful but borders template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Knots-as-memory encoding fresh synthesis, risk of lyric hush pays off in preservation reconfiguration; inevitable hindsight from fulgurite intro.</comment>
