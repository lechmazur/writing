<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marden's motivation to restore family harmony is rooted in concrete traits like his leaf blower tradition and embodied in gripping the worn cord; contradictory grief/eagerness acts in the conducting scene. Final bow as earned stasis forecloses his presence with felt cost of fading into memory. No unearned epiphanies; interiority particular and pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds from blowers to hum threading wind, reconfiguring silence with closure as RR (Charged Poise in blowers sputtering, laughter echoing back). Orientation anchored early in echo chamber. Cost legible in "tunnel grew quiet, but... full" and Marden's bow; persistent constraint of membrane/world cracks shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel as micro-setting constrains via sound magnification/reach, charging final pendulum image; sensory hierarchy (roar, hum, wind) reflects Marden's auditory bias under grief-pressure. Blowers' pitches and worn plastic tactilely lived-in, mirroring internal softening. Details evolve causally with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break household silence/restore laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via blower layers to lullaby wind threading cracks, narrowing otherworld options. Agency in conducting forces family micro-responses (daughter's laugh, texts); cost in blowers dying and Marden's dissolution unmistakable on-page, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing unspoken grief emerges from sound-as-reach particulars, not statement; final "haunting... that heals" image reweights premise without moralizing. Laughter's return via wind offers resonant answer to silence's walls. Subtext in "spaces between" gestures lingers with ambiguity of Marden's fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with afterlife focalization consistent; perceptual signature in auditory bias ("sounds lived twice") biased to Marden's conductor lens. Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity—short bursts in roar, lyrical in hum. No dialogue on-page; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roar filled... became reach" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches scene (build to sputter). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; "macerate the silence" purposeful without overwriting. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Afterlife leaf-blower symphony transforms ghost story tropes into healing echo-mechanics, fresh synthesis inevitable from setup. Risky tonal pivot to restorative haunting heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully to sound-logic particulars.</comment>
