<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies through mapping silences, with embodied details like the warming wing and stiff joints grounding her competence. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for deeper internal conflict. Final endurance of wandering life earned with felt physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to fragment prophecy pattern; on-page closure via Resonant Reconfiguration with spent wing and lingering hush as legible cost. Single continuous scene fits scope; prophecy off-page but her work anchors causality. "The prophecy's pattern fragmenting" line seals tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook's whispers and pockets of stillness (fox breath, spider web) constrain mapping choices and charge final sanctuary image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her silence-gift bias. Nocturnal haven tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush coded prophecy) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via deepening silence weave narrows transmission options with hours-long vigil as visible cost. Wing spent forecloses future ease. Prophecy infection coherent pressure without resolution coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as incantation emerges organically from hush-weaving events; final brook shift offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prophecy threat. Complexity in quiet competence vs. endless vigilance avoids tidy moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: "architecture of emptiness" biases noticing absences. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from vigilant mapping to tranquil close. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("oil across troubled water") taught early, propels without loops or scaffolds. Varied syntax/paragraphs flow read-aloud; crane wing's fade crisply advances closure image. Minor density risks offset by clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-magic inverse (hushing via silence maps) transforms prophecy trope through grounded origami talisman and brook conduit. Risky tranquil tone heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hush victory from particular gift feels bold, non-template.</comment>
