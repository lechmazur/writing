<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "foolish. Unscholarly. But Yara held her breath and let herself believe," earning the rune-drawing choice with embodied stress cost; interiority particular via grandmother's voice interleaving doubt and faith.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure at "Piece by piece, the crystallization shed... Beneath it: new skin. Pink and tender," with legible cost in vulnerability; single scene oriented early, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating platform between storms constrains timing ("this breath") and charges final rain-on-rune image; sensory hierarchy (petrichor, crystal song) filters through Yara's scholarly urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively as internal stress coils during rune draw, narrowing to superstitious agency that forecloses scholarly doubt with tender-skin cost; one deepening suffices, legible at crystal fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of silver rune "gleaming through the rain" reweights superstition-vs-scholarship question non-literally, emerging from scar-shedding particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (quill "precise as a surgeon's blade") biases toward rune precision; lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to storm without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The crystal sang. A high, thin note...") varies rhythm in peak beat; zero loops, purposeful figures like "ice releasing its grip" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes rune scholarship and folk superstition into inevitable crystal-song release; transforms fantasy tropes via quill-on-scar specificity, risking unorthodox closure payoff.</comment>
