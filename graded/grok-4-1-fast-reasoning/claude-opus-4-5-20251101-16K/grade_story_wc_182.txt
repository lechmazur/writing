<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's renegotiation insight reveals contradictory impulses (rescue vs. preserve) acting in the pivotal scene with the girl, earning the final choice; time traveler's exhaustion embodies repeated failure without stock phrasing. Girl's refusal shows flawed determination complicating rescue. Minor expository lean in traveler's "forty-seven times" line slips polish but doesn't undermine closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diary map → gaps → library entry tightens to on-page RR closure ("we'll remember together") reconfiguring rescue with felt cost of extraction's failure across timelines. Orientation anchors immediately in bookstore/mountain. No breaks; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mountain's spiraling shelves and motionless dust gaps constrain ascent and charge final "mountain sang" image, mirroring internal preservation shift. Sensory hush (unheard symphony) reflects priorities; selective narrowing under ascent urgency. Body/resource satchel integrates lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue via library) signaled early, tightens via Vera's agency-driven renegotiation narrowing options to preservation; cost legible in traveler's stare and girl's "I can't leave." Causal pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserving unlearned lessons emerges via flowers/gaps/images, resonant non-literal answer in transcribing/choir swelling reweighting extraction premise without moralizing. Particulars (self-writing books) avoid platitudes; ambiguity in "someone has to remember" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Vera with perceptual bias (translating absences); dialogue subtextual ("You'd abandon a child?") pursues goals, distinct voices (traveler's hollow laugh vs. girl's resolve). Rhythmic modulation swells to closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The idea settled... like the first note"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Rhythm breathes with ascent, peaks in "symphony swelled"; clean propulsion to singing mountain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-loop tragedy, absence-mapping, self-writing unlearned books transforms tropes organically; renegotiation turn inevitable from prior particulars. Bold conceptual risk (rescuing lessons) heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
