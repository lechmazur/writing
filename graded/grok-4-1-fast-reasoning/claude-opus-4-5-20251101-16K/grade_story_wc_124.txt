<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory caution (palm to door) yields to surrender at rose's exhale, earning vial-opening with embodied cost of wept years; interior scents particularize without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via UV inscription ("For Maren...") to CR closure in vial unstoppering; legible cost in "wept for the years... running from fragrance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse dome and timed rose constrain revelation timing, charging dawn's "shadows that glittered like grief transmuted"; scents filter through broker's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to test grief's scent tightens at personal memory trigger ("her mother's hair"), forcing agency in breathing rose; cost unmistakable in on-page weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vial's "permission" and transmuted shadows reweight memory-as-threat premise non-literally; emerges from scent particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual signature in light/scent diction ("cold, angular, almost sentient"); rhythmic control heightens revelation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "rain on summer stone... mother's hair" propels without loops; varied syntax like em-dashes breathes with emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV lantern broker and grief-as-perfume synthesize scents/light into inevitable CR; transforms memory trope via aromatic specificity and timed extinction.</comment>
