<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corrine's contradictory impulses surface in convulsion vs. whisper, earning her "No, I was just a child" rejection with embodied tears; Mattias's micro-choices reveal ritual expertise balanced by time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as loops layer from hum to prayer to her truth, tightening to silence crash that dissipates entity—RR closure with room-stabilizing cost legible in fading symbols.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shifting walls (stone to breathing skin) constrain sound tactics, flickering to void under entity pressure; bare-foot pedal and Threshold Gray charge final restored hum image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>20-minute clock and unraveling anchor escalate via layered questions narrowing to Corrine's looped truth; agency forces trade-off with visible convulsion/void cost charging exorcism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Entity's "She believes she deserves nothing" reveals assumption wound, reweighted non-literally by her "No" and final silence capture echoing truth-repetition theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound-biased perceptual signature ("texture of devotion," "cage of repetition") modulates rhythm to crescendo/release; dialogue subtext distinguishes wind-glass entity from Corrine's small voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Silence crashed into the chamber like a wave, and he wielded it deliberately" delivers peak propulsion with zero loops/artifacts; varied syntax sustains density through ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound-loop exorcism via assumption-plumbing synthesizes acoustic architecture and psychology, transforming trope through pedal ritual and gray symbols—risk heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
