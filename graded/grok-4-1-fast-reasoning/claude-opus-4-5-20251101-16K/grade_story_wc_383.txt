<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's arc shines through concrete conversion via shell's evidence, with embodied reactions like gasping at mother's terror driving internal conflict to earned forgiveness; contradictory impulses act in pressing crystals despite past dismissal; final choice forecloses ignorance-path with felt cost of inherited truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as revelations density-build to CR closure in "I choose differently," reweighting quarantine premise with undeniable cost of curdled isolation; orientation anchors early in garden/shell; persistent constraint of dawn ritual shapes all tactics without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet garden/resonance structures constrain ritual choices and charge final image of blooms-to-gold/crystals-silent; sensory hierarchy (purple blooms drinking light, shell's hum) filters through Mira's priorities; environment evolves causally from twilight to dawn, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unquarantining memories signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening revelations (father's death, curdled protection), narrowing to independence-choice with legible cost; agency in archiving own voice forecloses jailer-path; single decisive density-shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quarantine-as-misguided-gift emerges organically from particulars like shell-whispers and crystal-emotions, answered non-literally in final walk as knowledge-foundation; resonant ambiguity lingers in "alone by choice"; no moralizing, reweights isolation premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (shell's "tragic radiance," garden "breathing"); rhythmic control modulates from whispering hum to dawn peace; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-embedded action (shell-to-crystal presses); minor figurative density in opening garden ("drinking dying light") purposeful for tone, not obscuring peak revelations; no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional crystals/quarantined shell transforms memory-ritual trope into textured independence-arc; risk-taking in accumulative fantasy logic feels inevitable in hindsight; non-obvious reweighting of isolation elevates beyond templates.</comment>
