<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied ("chest seize," "hurt like dying"); contradictory impulses in knowing pain but unwinding anyway; final endurance earned via first card's cost, separating father's face from Fool.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup/questioning to unraveling pattern break ("walls had stopped closing in"); Charged Poise closure legible with cost in "empty enough to fill with something living."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Porthole beam and curved walls constrain timing/pressure, recur to charge images ("knife of light," dawn's "hammered copper"); sensory hierarchy painterly and urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmake blended souls) signaled early, deepens accumulatively after first card forecloses holding path; agency in redesign, cost unmistakable in embodied pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unmaking thefts emerges via threads/images, final blank cards reweight premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer in "heart finally empty enough to fill with something living."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (colors/threads as essence); rhythmic control modulates from dread to resolve, diction painterly yet precise ("pigment," "brushstrokes").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies propulsively ("Thread by thread, color by color"); metaphors coherent and charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot portraits bleeding essences, transformed via painterly unmaking; risk in internalized action heightens grief's ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
