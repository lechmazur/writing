<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in patient engagement with ghosts, embodied in "weightless burden...present without painful," earning his final choice to pocket the barrel. Minor slip: ghost's exposition feels slightly unearned against his competence, but doesn't touch closure. Contradictory impulses act in scene via his acceptance of the burden as gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dust patterns → ghost → panel 17 → box → resolution, with closure as Decisive Change when "weight of Victor's...begin[s] to lift." Orientation anchored early in ticket office assessment. Cost legible in shifting burden; lens Causal coherent to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns and sagging ceiling tiles constrain choices, charging final ladder climb and panel removal. Sensory hierarchy via Marcus's expertise (mildew, cotton candy, fluorescents) mirrors internal rot. Recurring cracks subtly guide to lath "skeleton," recharging in circus lie reveal; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceilings' secrets) tightens causally via ghost directive, narrowing to take-or-leave decision with felt cost in burden reconfiguration. Agency in climbing and pocketing forecloses ghosts' vigil. Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration, but escalation coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden rot/guilt emerges via cracks, fire lie, and mainspring, reweighted in final "gift more than a curse" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from "real job...what ceilings hid." Resonant non-literal answer in sunlit exit; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in machinery metaphors ("stuck pulleys"); dialogue subtext-driven ("You're looking in the wrong place"). Rhythm modulates under stress, diction character-bound. No head-hopping; voice distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in "crouched and studied...clean outline"; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Zero figurative muddle in peak (box find); clean grammar. 9+ test: propulsion clear, no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech's ceiling expertise + ghosts transforms ghost story tropes via dust/causality chain. Risk in ghostly circus backstory heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in "fixed what machines couldn't touch."</comment>
