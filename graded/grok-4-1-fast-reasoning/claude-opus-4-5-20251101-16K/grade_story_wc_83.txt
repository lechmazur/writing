<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hollow beauty vs. survival guilt) act in geode-handling beats, earning final commitment to hunt with visible cost of refusing forgetfulness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflective density tightens from personal geode memory to global pools; CR closure lands in final image of ghosts swirling beneath indifferent sky, reweighting futures with devastating cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode as micro-setting constrains sensor choice and charges final glow; observatory viewport and 40k ft drift mirror internal isolation, evolving with systems hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (mapping unused potential) signaled early tightens accumulatively via growing pools (Lagos to Yemen); agency in geode positioning forecloses forgetting with felt devastation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ghost math emerges organically from pool images at tragedies; final observatory image offers resonant CR without moral, reweighting loss as accumulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (quantum foam ripples, frozen screams); rhythmic prose modulates from memory-breath to calculation propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "pool" recurrence; varied syntax propels without loops, metaphors coherent (crystal teeth as screams) in peak readings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quantum unused potential as fresh premise transforms grief into cosmic hunt; risk of bleak sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes in geode-filtered readings.</comment>
