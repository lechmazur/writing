<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vesper's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like feeling "sorrow described a perfect parabolic curve," rooting her motivation in transposed empathy; final blurring of borrowed vs. own feelings ("She couldn't tell anymore") earns endurance with cost. Lumen applies precise secondary pressure via star-counting questions. No diagnostic labels; flaws (no own light) drive compulsive borrowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star vanishings build density toward CR closure in final image ("pressed it against her heart, absorbing whatever light it still held"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-loss. Orientation anchors immediately ("topaz workshop," Vesper at press). Single scene coherent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz walls "hum in resonance" constrain printing action; halo fragment as micro-setting charges final image, narrowing perception to "fractured amber patterns" under vanishing stars. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (equations garden, lead type). No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map emotions to halt cosmic forgetting) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Lumen's "four tonight" and Vesper's "sharp crystalline ache"; endurance forecloses inaction path with felt cost. Agency in feverish printing; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as vital mathematics) emerges organically from pamphlet transmission and star losses; final image reconfigures "borrowed soul" pamphlets as cosmic equation with non-literal resonance, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in ambiguity invites complexity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (emotions as "angles, measure its velocity"); voice modulates rhythmically ("press clanked and groaned") under pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual: Vesper's "sum of everyone I've been" disorients purposefully; distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences amid lyric flow); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent ("parabolic curve"). Minor overwriting in star-vanishing repeats doesn't dull closure propulsion. Clean mechanics propel to final "impossible arithmetic."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress, halo fragments, and emotion-math premise transforms tropes into inevitable cosmic stakes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens without gimmickry, fresh in "transposed empathy" driving closure.</comment>
