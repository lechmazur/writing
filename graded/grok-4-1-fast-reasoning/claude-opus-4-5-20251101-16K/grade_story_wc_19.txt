<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia contradicts her patient engineering of the lock via breath corrosion, embodied in clawing at doors and ascending during inversion; final realization reframes her collections as seeds with the cost of returning to bunkers. Contradictory impulses act in the patient modification vs. weeping in vaults. Internal voice particular through silence-tasting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of silences build to CR at vine sprouting from doll, reweighting enclosures as burial vs. climbing growth, with cost of gravity's pull legible in "The inversion hour neared its end." One tightening at apex discovery suffices; no orientation debt, anchors by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Xenial trellis constrains climb and collects silences via inversion physics; doll as micro-setting charges final sprout image. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's tasting (mineral quiet, feathered hush). Inversion gravity evolution affects action without contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gilded hush) signaled early, tightens via time ("half spent") and unexpected vine forcing reinterpretation; agency in doll-pressing yields CR with felt cost of descent. Escalation Accumulative via silence density to gleaming hush under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of openness vs. enclosure emerges via bunker vaults pressing "like a held breath" vs. hush as "safety through openness"; final vine "silence made visible" reweights mother's vanishing without moralizing. Doll shifts from vessel to seed, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in silence flavors ("tasted of honey"); rhythmic prose modulates from confined breath to "contracted chest stretching." No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density: "Wind that had pushed now pulled" propels via varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Final line "She would preserve it by letting it climb" recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, silence flavors, xenial trellis transforms tropes into organic world; vine sprout from hush reconfigures bunkers inevitably. Bold sci-fantastic risks heighten stakes without gimmick.</comment>
