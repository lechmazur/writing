<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of grief and persistence embodied in shard-gripping and core expedition; final renewal earned via vessel discovery tying personal loss to Carvers' grief. Interiority particular without epiphanies. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard to storm to intact vessels, landing CR closure in report/shard placement with persistence cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via core find suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temporal light and core chambers constrain choices (mirrors covered, vessels lifted); final spires/starlight image recharges grief/memory motif. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (poetic angles in crystal).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove Carvers' depth) signaled early, deepens via vessel's captured joy/grief moment forcing interpretive shift; agency in storm-defying expedition, cost in revolutionary endurance felt at report.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-art emerges organically via vessels encoding loss; final dreaming image reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of persistence amid failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third with poetic perceptual signature (light refracting sorrow); diction/rhythm modulates from storm tension to charged poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative consistency (temporal moss/ribbons) purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of shard beside report.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, carved grief-artifacts, personal revolution; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
