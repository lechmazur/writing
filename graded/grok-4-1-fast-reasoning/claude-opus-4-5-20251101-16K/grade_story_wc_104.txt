<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied emotion (trembling hands amid efficient grace) and contradictory impulses (pausing to absorb radio news before renewed urgency); final endurance as liberator-turned-planter earned by scars and stakes, with visible cost in persistent chains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through decoding beats to Charged Poise closure ("carrying the weight of ten thousand futures"); cost legible in final image, but arrow's spiral fletching feels slightly under-motivated as pivot despite causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (dust motes, yellowed keys, iridescent feathers) filters through Mira's priorities, constraining choices (piano bench seam to wall); carnival debris charges final contrast with seeds, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure seeds amid regime fall) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via radio ("perhaps hours") forcing trade-off between celebration and action; protagonist agency in prying/decoding narrows options with felt cost (trembling under pack weight).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-from-ruins emerges organically via particulars (scars as jewelry, plastic prizes vs. seeds); final image offers resonant reconfiguration ("staggering grace... toward fields that waited"), reweighting tyranny's absence with growth's cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (rebellion scars "like jewelry," fields "hungry and patient"); rhythmic control modulates urgency (short sentences in radio beat), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax accelerates decoding); no loops or scaffolds, specific diction (iridescent fletching, nitrogen-fixing beans); minor overwriting in sunset wall but purposeful for payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: piano-key coordinates and fletched arrow transform seed-vault quest into musical puzzle amid carnival decay; risk in quiet, image-driven closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
