<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as encoded balladeer intensifies compellingly from personal silence to aiding the caretaker, with contradictory impulses (aloud vs. scratched songs) acting in the spiral-adding beat. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in "drifting like watercolor across wet stone." Final endurance earned by forty-year pattern, foreclosing direct speech with patient cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from awakening to new spiral for caretaker, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Mira settles "like a held breath," reweighting silence into endless song with conceptual endurance cost legible in final alcove image. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/mist. One tightening via caretaker observation narrows to specific message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard, vapor foundations, thunder constrain drifting action and symbol placement; fountain micro-setting charges caretaker pause and final patient wait. Sensory hierarchy (lightning flashes, mist curling) reflects ghost POV bias. Final image of worn bolt plate recharges environment, mirroring encoded persistence.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate sideways) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via caretaker's "heaviness," forcing encoding choice that forecloses direct voice. Cost felt in "forty years learning that truth" and eternal drift. Pressure coheres texturally without reversal, but lacks micro-turn for 9+ agency drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encoded voice emerges organically from scratches vs. silence conflict; final "courtyard itself...singing" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in "let your voice leak sideways" charged by graffiti particulars, lingering ambiguity of caretaker's response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("spaces between lightning and thunder") stable in single ghost POV; syntax/rhythm modulate from expansive drift to suspended poise. Compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping; diction biased to watercolor/symbol patterns.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, advance texture (e.g., "white fire...breathless moment"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; purposeful lyricism in peak beats like spiral-pressing. Zero artifacts dull closure image of mist "like dreams finding their shape."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-in-code premise fresh via graffiti encoding and bolt plate; transforms silence trope through mountain-song specifics. Risky lyric structure heightens eternal stake coherence. Final reconfiguration inevitable from encoded pattern, no derivatives.</comment>
