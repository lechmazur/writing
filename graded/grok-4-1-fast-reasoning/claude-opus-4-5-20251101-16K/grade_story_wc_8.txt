<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: contradictory impulses (destruction of charities vs. truth dedication) act in scene via embodied analysis during wait; final choice to take letter earned by prior causality with cost to Gerald visible in his silence. Emotionally rational trait shown concretely without labels. Voices distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens to Hybrid closure (Conceptual Repricing: truth over noble lies) lands on-page as Miriam slides letter into satchel and walks away, reweighting premise with felt cost (charities' loss). Petal fall causally links to Gerald's emergence; one tightening via dialogue suffices. Orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station, ivy, petal as micro-settings constrain choice (wait for petal drop) and charge final image (walks past fallen petal). Sensory details (wind-trembling petal, rustling ivy) mirror erosion theme through POV bias. Recurrent petal/ivy evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acquire letter to expose lie) signaled early, tightens via Prester John parallel narrowing Gerald's reluctance; agency in persuasion forces his concession. Cost legible in hospitals/orphanages mention and her unyielding "Yes." Escalation coherent under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from letter reveal, parallels, and final walk; resonant non-literal answer in "past the fallen petal, toward a world that would soon lose a beloved saint" reweights prior material. Subtext in archbishop's "smirk" and ivy erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (historian's analytical filter on petal, letter); dialogue natural/subtextual (Gerald's "People need their saints" vs. her counter). Rhythmic control modulates from patient wait to charged handover; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches beats (slow petal watch accelerates in dialogue); minor figurative density ("small red wound," "metastasize") coherent but borders overwrite in opening. No loops; varied rhythm, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forged saint premise transformed via historian's quest and station decay mirroring truth's erosion; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes. No template echoes; particulars (1287 famine invention) irreplaceable.</comment>
