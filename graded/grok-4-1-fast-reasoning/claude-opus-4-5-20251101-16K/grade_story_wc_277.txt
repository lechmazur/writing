<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between stellar escape and earthly regret act in scene via pen examination, earning final action with visible cost of foreclosed avoidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflective density yields pen DC with cost of shattered natural-death assumption; orientation anchors immediately in observatory post-call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cloud-perched observatory constrains isolation for proof-by-contradiction, echoing dome amplifies whisper realization to charge orbital closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of paternal truth discovery deepens via proof contradiction under textural lens, agency in observance forces call with foreclosed regret-orbit cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orbits motif returns reweighted from decay to applied force, resonating non-literal answer to regret's pull without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astronomical perceptual signature ("orbits of regret," "light from dead stars") biases notice, rhythmic control heightens revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; "rosewood separated along an invisible seam" exemplifies propulsion without loops or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Proof-by-contradiction engine ingeniously fuses logic, astronomy, and detection trope into inevitable pen reveal.</comment>
