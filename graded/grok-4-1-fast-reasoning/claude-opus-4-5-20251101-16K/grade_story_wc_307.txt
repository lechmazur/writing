<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to withhold truth for patient revelation drives her guidance, earning Marek's transformation; his grasping struggle versus stillness shows contradictory impulses in the trance beat. Minor slip in embodied interiority—Marek's tears feel told rather than layered with hypocrisy or self-deception. Voices distinct in dialogue idiom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripples accumulate revelations, tightening to fourth ring's CR where sister's backwards aging reconfigures time's flow with emotional cost legible in Marek's tears and lighter grief. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene, one deepening sufficient. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto and pond constrain trance choices, bending starlight and humming to mirror internal states; floating platform rocks gently, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's ancient perception selective and vivid, not checklist. Recurrent stones/ripples evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister's fate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ring-deepening, Marek's impatience narrowing to stillness with agency in breathing; cost felt in withheld full truth, foreclosing immediate closure. One tightening via fourth ring resolves under lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing-as-transformation emerges via ripple particulars, reweighted in final CR: time flows many directions, sister's choice non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in withheld rings invites ambiguity; no thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with clean focalization; perceptual signature in "sycamore hush" diction and rhythmic modulation under trance pressure. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Elara instructs, Marek whispers), distinct idiom. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job in image/action (e.g., stone throw blooms rings, launches trance). Rhythmic variety, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful lyricism without muddle in peak trance beats. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("spilled diamonds," "wet sand") but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Backwards aging and ripple-trance synthesize fresh magical realism on time/revelation, transformed via Elara's reversing life; risk in withholding closure heightens stakes. No derivative templates; final stone reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
