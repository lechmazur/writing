<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's arc from arrogant thief to "apprentice of wonder" earned via embodied guilt ("soul crack") and micro-choice to offer service; contradictory impulses in past theft vs. code resolve in penance with visible cost. Emissary applies relational pressure, forcing reconfiguration. Final renunciation of treasures feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wrong sky signals contact, piece swaps build density of secrets, revelation reconfigures premise as CR with felt cost (lost compass, transformed grief). Orientation anchored early via sundial and spire. Single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains isolation for sacred exchange; frost "like scattered diamonds" and "perpetual cold" mirror internal fracture, charging final descent image. Sundial as micro-setting reveals truth, filters POV bias. Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend theft) signaled early, deepens via emissary's message forcing stance shift from info-trade to open service; one tightening narrows options under lens with legible cost (compounded failure). Agency in game and offer drives escalation. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as "becoming one" emerges organically via theft-loss-exchange-revelation, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Emissary's wind-chime laugh and scholar's grief add resonant ambiguity. Particulars like chess secrets avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: thief's grace in "stealing as act of divine." Dialogue subtextual ("You are the one who seeks to mend"), distinct idioms (emissary's alien patience). Rhythmic modulation peaks in revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful figurative like "liquid starlight" integrates without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in swap beats. Minor descriptive stacks in opening, but closure image crisp: "chess pieces... transformed into something like prayer."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chess-swap ritual across veils transforms thievery tropes into sacred ceremony; sundial as truth-lens fresh synthesis. Bold risk in playful penance heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via code violation. No derivative hedging.</comment>
