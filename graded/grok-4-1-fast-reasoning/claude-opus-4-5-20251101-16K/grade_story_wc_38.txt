<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory impulses—vulnerability fueling rebellion—earned through dance-micro-choices; final readiness forecloses gratitude with mother's memory as cost, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dice rolls to "L-I-V" charged poise closure; orientation anchors instantly in lab/who/when; cost legible in poised risk as ventilation cycles near.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent creatures' final image charges closure, mirroring pattern recognition; lab pressure constrains ventilation escape tactics; selective sensory hierarchy (crushing quiet, bone clicks) reflects POV urgency without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant liberation stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal revelations to dice-roll tightening; agency in encoded defiance forecloses compliance path with detection cost felt in poised "she was ready."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encoded defiance emerges organically from dance/dice/particulars; final bioluminescent image offers non-literal reconfiguration—"rhythm over fear"—reweighting vulnerability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (rhythms, patterns) stable in single tight POV; diction/rhythm modulates from quiet buildup to charged final poise; purposeful compression taught early, legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to "dice caught the low light"; metaphors cohere (spider web) without muddle; precise verbs anchor closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dance-as-decoding in sunken lab transforms code-breaking trope organically; dice "L-I-V" turn inevitable from pattern; bold lyric defiance heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
