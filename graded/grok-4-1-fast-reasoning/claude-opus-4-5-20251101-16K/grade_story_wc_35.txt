<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in gloved isolation versus bare-hand submersion compel the core choice; character's tasting gift roots motivation particular to chef worldview. Final endurance—smoothing own remorse amid flood—earned with cost of pavilion's loss. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like contagion risk drive inevitable solo struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory layering of tastes and regrets tightens to RR closure in "The coral columns began to groan," reconfiguring pavilion with conceptual cost of erasure. Orientation anchored early in desert fortress post-rain; single arc with legible shards. Cost legible in ice weeping and dunes burying entrance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coral-ice pavilion constrains choice (tidal pools guide analysis) and charges final image via melting/gone mercy. Sensory hierarchy chef-specific: tastes dominate (copper/ash/sea-rot), post-rain glistening anchors entry. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal smoothing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smooth jagged memories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bare-hand flood to pavilion crack—agency in eroding edges forecloses structure with visible cost. Pressure coheres texturally, narrowing to lighter hands post-submersion. One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in groaning columns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges organically from tasting/smoothing particulars; final cooking image—"meal seasoned with forgiveness"—resonates as non-literal answer reweighting remorse premise without moralizing. Counter-readings plausible in brittle hope; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with chef-biased perceptual signature (ingredients reveal history); diction/rhythm culinary-inflected, modulates from dream subtlety to submersion intensity. No elision or head-hopping; voice texture distinct in tasting metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "copper and ash, sea-rot and something sweet like spoiled fruit" advances taste/emotion/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (beach glass), integrated without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef gift, contagion curse, and impossible coral-ice remorse vault transforms tropes organically; risk in premise commitment heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration—sand-buried mercy in breakfast—inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
