<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied worry stone presses revealing anxious endurance; motivation rooted in chess-honed precision compels reflective stasis with exile cost, though lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density building to Charged Poise closure ("felt something like peace settle... precisely as it should be"); cost legible in "difficult road stretched before her" reconfiguring wandering as chosen hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus compasses and basalt outcrop constrain choices by confusing trackers and cueing rotation; twilight/nightbird sensory details charge final stars image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant exile stake signaled early, deepens texturally through silence/chess memory pattern forcing endurance crystallization; one tightening via nexus protection narrows options to departure with felt wandering cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-difficulty emerges organically from Elena's arc, silence translation, and nexus chaos; final stone/thumb-stars image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (compass spins, nightbird as "scattered pawns"); rhythmic modulation from melancholy to hopeful poise distinct and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful stone recurrences build texture without loops, figurative language ("memories grew teeth") coherent and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutor exile, silence translation, and magnetic nexuses transforms wandering trope; reflective structure risks bold lyricism heightening stakes through irreplaceable nexus logic.</comment>
