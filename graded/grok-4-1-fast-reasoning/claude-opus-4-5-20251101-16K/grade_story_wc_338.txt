<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's methodically curious trait roots motivation consistently, compelling higher-stakes choices like contacting the heritage board; interiority shines in concrete observations like "a crease did not match its fold." Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.0, but final agency to reopen feels earned with felt institutional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering discoveries (map tear → notes → footage → vault), tightening to CR closure: final whisper realization reconfigures preservation limits with undeniable conceptual cost ("some maps had to stay torn"). Shards pattern taught early at map edge, transitions legible; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault and frescoes constrain discovery and charge final image, with selective sensory details (archival smells, gleaming stones "like old teeth," whisper acoustics) filtered through Elena's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (standing spot) mirrors internal boundaries; 9+ gate met as environment shapes choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth whispering mystery) signaled early at map tear, escalates accumulatively via footage deepening (changing frescoes), narrowing options to reopening with 4-month institutional cost legible. Agency in evidence presentation forces stance crystallization; minor abstractness in early pressure prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interpretive empathy emerges organically from map boundaries and layered frescoes/voices, culminating in resonant CR: final whisper/exhibition plan reweights knowledge limits without moralizing ("space between speaking and hearing"). Particulars like visual echoes avoid platitudes; 9+ test met with non-literal answer charging prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (pattern-noticing idiom like "ink layered over ink"); rhythmic modulation builds textural density without head-hopping or withholding. Voice specificity elevates noticing; no dialogue to judge, but prose confidence matches Elena's cautious expertise.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.8<comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid descriptive breaths); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in "slow seepage of water uncovering...in reverse order" risks density dip but integrates; clean mechanics propel to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms henge mystery via map-framer's lens on "Terra Incognita" boundaries and evolving frescoes, with footage comparison as non-obvious turn grounded in priors. Risky accumulative shards heighten ingenuity without gimmickry; transformation test passes as premise hinges on perceptual craft.</comment>
