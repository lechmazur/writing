<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent traits like fluidity and non-judgment compel endurance of decay; interiority concrete in tracing spines or shimmering presence. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure—no crisis tests hierarchy of values. Final endurance of role feels earned but uncharged by pivotal micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to Charged Poise in final paragraphs. Orientation anchored early (keeper in catacombs library). Closure CR legible with conceptual cost in "peace crumbles beautifully, as peace always does"—reweights change as neutral without judgment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains and charges: obsidian refuge rebuilds "cracks in consciousness," swan folds hold "living moments," library decay felt through stone. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (drip overwhelms, river pulse heals). Final image of root pushing, water carving recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain witnessing amid decay) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via heavy silence to regenerative rebuild. One deepening: shelf collapse narrows to refuge endurance. Cost felt in "worn away" consciousness, but abstract—no live option foreclosed on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of serenity in surrender emerges from particulars: books to soil to roots cycle. Resonant CR in "She will be here to see it... This is enough" reweights premise without moral. Subtext in swan's softening folds avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: decay as "patient crumbling," change "simply is." Rhythmic control modulates from heavy silence to poised acceptance. Lyrical diction purposeful, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful repetition (crumbling, silence) builds texture without loops. No artifacts, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion aligns with accumulative builds, clear in "folds cryptic with accumulated meaning."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fluid keeper burrowing via swan into regenerative silence transforms entropy trope. Risky lyricism heightens stakes of endurance without gimmick. Irreplaceable details like vines reading roots cohere as singular vision.</comment>
