<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization shines through embodied actions like whisking tea and mending nets, with Dao's demure audacity revealed in his gentle question "Why do you mend nets?"—earning the succession moment. Internal consistency and relationship crucible force Dao's recognition, foreclosing ignorance with felt cost of apprenticeship. Minor telling of traits doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from firefly patterns to Dao's realization and final silence as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting hidden effort with succession cost legible in "When I am gone, you will sit here." Single scene oriented early (parapet post-rain by ~50 words); lens holds cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via wet stones for moon paths and amplified whispers mirroring patterns; recurring whisk and fireflies charge final image. Sensory details (glistening parapet, humid air) filter through Mira's priorities, evolving post-rain. Micro-setting (parapet curve) guides whispers, enabling thematic discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, deepens texturally via Dao's pattern recognition and net-mending dialogue, narrowing to succession trade-off. One tightening forecloses complacency with unacknowledged work's cost felt in firefly energy and Mira's future absence. Stakes subtle but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from firefly dance, nets, and whispers, reweighted in final image without moralizing—"teacher and student sat in scintillatingly somber silence." Subtext in Dao's question layers complexity; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Mira's perceptual signature (patterns in nets/orbits); voice modulates rhythmically from ritual calm to charged silence. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You already do"), distinguishing voices without head-hopping. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences advance via integrated images (e.g., "swirled it through the humid air"). Minor overuse of "scintillatingly somber" fits tone without muddling closure; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mentor-apprentice via net-mender philosophy and firefly mathematics transforms tropes; moon paths/whispers add ingenuity. Quiet lyric risk heightens stakes in unacknowledged effort's poise without gimmickry.</comment>
