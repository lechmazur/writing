<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's stillness amid recognition pinnacle—"Her hands did not tremble. She had learned stillness"—earns final endurance via prior forgiveness causality; contradictory rage-to-tenderness impulses act in guiding micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from arrival to pool dissolve to tree vigil; Charged Poise closure in "scalloped edges gleaming like small smiles" reconfigures cyclical contentment with eternal-wait cost legible on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto clouds/tree/pool constrain choices—climbing for reflection, pool for rebirth—charging hairpin finale; sensory hush/vineyard stillness mirrors internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-tending) tightens at hairpin recognition, forcing renunciation of reunion; agency in "gently" removing pin forecloses path with separation cost felt in dissolve and vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cycle theme emerges from particulars—hairpin transfer, pool dissolve—repriced in "contentment...blooming and fading, requiring its own rebirth," resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("clouds that moved like slow breath") modulates rhythmically with pressure; dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden ("Resting"); stable close-third POV biases toward kindly decisiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "vineyard hush...deepen," varying rhythm propels to charged closure; zero loops/artifacts, precise diction embodies hush without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh afterlife synthesis transforms rebirth tropes via hairpin memory-transfer specificity; risk of reflective shard mosaic heightens cyclical stakes, inevitable in hindsight vigil image.</comment>
