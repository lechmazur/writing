<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots in concrete loss (mother's forgetting), embodied in steady hands chipping crystal; contradictory hope/persistence yields earned resolve to exhume more, with cost in faded eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whale ripples to coffee spiral commanding "Exhume"; CR closure reconfigures memory premise with undeniable conceptual cost in final harbor image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crystals constrain choice (follow lightness to cavity), charge final image; "crystals climbing the walls in geometric cathedrals" filters through Mira's priorities, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via gravity guidance to journal; agency in pattern-following forecloses forgetting with felt persistence cost, legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preserved memories emerges implicitly from particulars (whale, grounds, journal); final "harbor held its gleaming silence. And remembered" reweights premise non-literally, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns in foam/grounds/crystals); rhythmic prose modulates from dusk descent to charged poise, diction biased toward salt/ocean silences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; purposeful lyric figures taught early (gravity fluctuations) integrate cleanly, no artifacts dulling closure image of journal to chest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memories as gravity sinks/whale carriers transforms tropes organically; risk in surreal physics heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via crystallized journal discovery.</comment>
