<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deeply embodied interiority roots motivation in trauma (Eastbridge collapse), with relentless gentleness shown in pressing survivors; final endurance of her mission feels earned through micro-choices like spelling names. Contradictory impulses (benevolent ruthlessness) act in scene via whispered persistence. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via walking/whisper circuits to Charged Poise closure (queen handled, pawns absent forever), reweighting history's incompleteness with conceptual cost legible in "The pawns would always be gone." Single scene coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains choices (acoustics carry words 40m), chessboard charges final image; nomadic penumbra mirrors stance. Sensory hierarchy (whispers ghost-voiced) reflects POV urgency; spatial choreography clear in circuits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve small gestures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening density (names layered), narrowing to endurance vs. official histories; cost felt in persistent incompleteness at chessboard. Agency in patterned walking/REMEMBER; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pawns/small gestures emerges from particulars (Marta's hand, Theodor's look), reweighted non-literally in final queen/pawns image without moralizing; subtext in absences charges resonance. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to silences/textures (whispers returning transformed); rhythm modulates with intensity, compression purposeful in accumulative mode. No head-hopping; diction fits crisis survivor's haunted lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line layers meaning); rhythm varies, no loops though patterned repetition (whispers/pawns) taught early. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("nomadic penumbra") purposeful, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: whispering gallery as mnemonic space + pawnless chessboard transforms history trope into historian-of-gestures premise; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes of oblivion, inevitable in hindsight via walking patterns.</comment>
