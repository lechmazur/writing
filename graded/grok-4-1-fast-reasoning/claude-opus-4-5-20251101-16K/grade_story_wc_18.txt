<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vesna's craft-rooted motivation intensifies via embodied ache and persistent learning; micro-choices like sextant repair and breath-sync reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory longing/endurance acts in pursuit, earning capture with visible cost of years lost. Father's humming resolves without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from workshop decision to fog pursuit, tightening at silver flicker. Closure as RR in dream's embrace reconfigures memory with emotional cost legible in "fragment of who she had been." Orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog, frost, orchard constrain sight/navigation, forcing sextant/breath tactics; skeletal trees mirror internal blur. Sextant as micro-setting charges father's reflected face. Sensory selection (breath crystallizing, shimmer) reflects urgency, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture dream) signaled early, escalates via sync narrowing to flicker/pause under Accumulative lens. Agency in matching rhythm forecloses chase; cost felt in dream's wild resistance and reclaimed fragment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries theme emerges via breath-sync and mirror-sight, reweighting loss as capturable without statement. Final smile answers memory ache non-literally, charging glass mountains image with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with craft-biased perceptual signature (mercury/light metaphors); rhythm modulates with breath beats. Lyrical diction purposeful, no elision withholding; voice distinct and pressure-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via images like "ribbon of silver light"; metaphors coherent (fog as grief, glass mountains). No loops/artifacts; final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sextant-dream hunt transforms memory trope via mirror/astronomy synthesis; fog orchard as boundary-erasing world risks lyric pursuit successfully. Fresh in inevitable capture logic.</comment>
