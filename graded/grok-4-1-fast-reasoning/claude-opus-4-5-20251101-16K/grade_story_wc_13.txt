<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular through illustrator's eye (e.g., sketching frozen hummingbird, echo-spirits); micro-choices under pressure reveal values (deep borrow despite debt awareness); earned change with silver hair cost at reflection seals motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: time-lock fixes → cavern access → deep borrow DC → echoes free → Giant stirs but canals hold; closure RR/CR via aged reflection and singing shadows with undeniable cost ("silver threading through her hair").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain tactics (delicate vs. Giant, frozen junctions); POV-filtered details (copper-bright waters, temporal amber) integrate into action; final canal reflection charges closure image with bodily cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach Source before Giant wakes) signaled early, tightens via escalating locks and deep borrow agency; cost legible in aged hair and foreclosed lifespan, charging final image under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence motif reweights theme through freedom/resolution without statement; final footsteps with "singing shadows" offers resonant non-literal answer to restoration vs. personal debt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (invisible biology, luminous spirits); rhythmic control modulates urgency (short sentences in race back); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm without loops; figurative language purposeful (time as "river," amber cracks) in peak beats; propulsion clear through action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-debt magic, echo-spirits, Giant-scale world; risk in lyric fantasy transforms tropes organically, inevitable in hindsight via pendant's reprise.</comment>
