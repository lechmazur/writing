<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in survival philosophy taught by grandmother, shown concretely via tool setup and fragment use; interiority peaks in discarding assumptions amid charged air, earning her final laughter and transcendence realization with visible cost of rewritten certainties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from static to hush-voice revelation ("We went deeper"), landing CR closure where transcendence reweights abandonment premise; cost legible in "patterns she had spent her whole life learning not to see," with fragment press as tightening causal pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower platform and arrays constrain tuning choices, charging final image of waking dishes; sensory hierarchy (hair lifting, fillings aching) reflects interpreter bias, mirroring internal hush-expansion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retune echoes into beginnings) signaled early, escalates via assumption-discard and fragment-trigger deepening knowledge under Accumulative lens; agency in "Show me" whisper forces revelation with cost of upended lifelong assumptions unmistakable in gorge-filling hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unified endings/beginnings emerges organically from hush-revelation and city-waking, offering resonant CR answer in dawn light "rising rather than fall[ing]" that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (celestial signals as mineral dust, silence as solid presence) modulates rhythmically with revelation intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-thought (e.g., "veils dropping from a widow's face" coheres without muddle); varied rhythm propels from setup to hush-climax, zero loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent-film shard unlocking stellar hush-transcendence transforms abandoned-city trope; risk in fantasy-practical tools (cathedral-bell receiver) heightens stakes inevitably toward CR unity.</comment>
