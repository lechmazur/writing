<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied "spongey dread pooling" contradicting steady hands in pivotal decoding beat; final appeal choice earned by causal buildup of discoveries without unmotivated epiphany. Minor backstory summaries do not flatten pressure or touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with journal decoding tightening to nail revelation as key marker; Charged Poise closure in "pocketed the copper nail and began composing her appeal" reconfigures shame to action with legible dread cost. Orientation anchored early at station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station and sea constrain persistence amid "shuddered" anomalies and deliver journals/debris as plot fuel; final "sea continued bringing evidence" charges closure image through recurring environmental agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth reclamation escalates accumulatively via stanza decoding narrowing to appeal; agency in enduring isolation forecloses evacuation path with dread cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed courage emerges organically from nail/journals particulars, resonant in final "maps still guided those who knew how to look" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in map-tracing gestures ("traced her finger along a stanza"); rhythmic control modulates dread to resolve in charged poise without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("fingers closed around the copper nail"); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figures like "spongey feeling" enhance without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate exile, coded poems, coffin nail transforms tropes; risk in solo endurance amid failing instruments heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
