<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—engineer skepticism versus grandmother's legacy—act simultaneously in trembling hands and key insertion, earning her keeper transformation with embodied weeping as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting realizations to Charged Poise closure; key's perfect fit releases harmonic redirection, with "Maren wept" legible as emotional cost reconfiguring her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse as resonance chamber and drift-ice channels constrain activation choice and charge final image, with POV-filtered details like "microscopic ridges" evolving causally through song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens via 20-minute clock and ridge realization narrowing to vibrational activation; agency forecloses violence with grief-price in "her bones hum and her eyes water."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "flesh holding light, matter containing music" non-literally reweights belief-through-understanding premise, emerging from harmonic release without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with engineer signature—"frequency. Vibrational matching"—modulates rhythmically from observation to "bones hum" intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion—"The key slid home with a sound like a held breath releasing"—with varied rhythm, zero loops, purposeful figures without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic key transforms artifact-trope into non-violent physics-magic synthesis, risking ethereal physics for inevitable deflection heightened by ice-response pattern.</comment>
