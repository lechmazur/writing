<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meekness and determination embodied in "coal that refused to cool" and micro-choices like singing perseverance songs under doubt; contradictory impulses act in persistent returns despite weeping exhaustion, earning final endurance with felt cost in liminal chest-space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mine descent to progressive arch repairs ("Shepherd's Spine, then Merchant's Bow"), tightening to settlers' return; Charged Poise closure in child's apple and silk-wrap reconfigures doubt with undeniable persistence cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and resonance ore constrain repairs (crumbling shafts demand deliberate gathering); azure sky charges final image as "defiant as ever," mirroring internal reweighting; sensory hierarchy (humming stones as "second heartbeat") filters through Mira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience to reconnect orchards) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via arch-by-arch tightening that forecloses isolation; agency in endurance bears visible cost ("weeping with exhaustion"), charging final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resilience-in-gaps theme emerges organically from bolt-forging particulars and silk-whispers; final non-literal answer in "liminal space between understanding... and doubt," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in memory-noticing (silk "whispering fears and triumphs"); rhythmic lyric texture modulates for accumulative pressure, child's dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythm, no loops); purposeful metaphors like "coal refused to cool" integrate without muddle; peak beats (arch climbs) clear and embodied, zero scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional ore and memory-silk transforms lone-survivor trope into quiet persistence; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, with "azure defiance" as inevitable reweighting from particulars.</comment>
