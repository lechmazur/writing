<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief and micro-choices like fingering the needle amid sensory details; contradictory impulses between layered promises and present attention earn the final distillation with visible emotional cost. Single-POV coherence specific to coachman's perceptual bias. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from fog fragments to gutters' silence as cadence shift; Conceptual Repricing closure ("Pay attention") lands on-page with cost of endured loneliness foreclosing unraveling. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via ticking cessation triggers crossing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (textures, temperatures, rain percussion) filtered through POV's ambient awareness constrains waiting and charges final fog embrace; recurring fog/river/needle mirror internal percolation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (needle, planks) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill promise) signaled early, escalates texturally via percolation to gutters' silence narrowing to presence; agency in attentive endurance forecloses loneliness with felt cost in "small and essential" needle. Minor abstractness in stake slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of attention as love emerges organically from particulars (needle, fog, ticking); final image reconfiguration ("far shore like gentle revelation") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting grief without moralizing. Recurring images shift meaning earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (ambient awareness textures); rhythmic prose modulates from patient build to serene poise. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("Rain's nearly finished"); no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (palimpsest, spindrift) integrated without muddle; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts even in reflective peaks. Propulsion aligns with scene breathing, closure image crisp ("needle pressed against his thigh").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-via-sensory-distillation transforms widowhood trope through coachman's textured lens; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Final "distilled to its essence" feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
