<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guardian's micro-choices (cord pull, mirror tilt) reveal motivation without interiority; girl's embodied tremor-to-unclenching progression earns change under pressure. Minor archetypal slip in guardian's nameless stillness limits full 9+ distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ripples to light spirals; Charged Poise closure in final sitting/weeping image reconfigures desperation with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchors early (dock, watcher); single scene tightens meaningfully via shutter sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dock's wet planks and mist constrain choices (cord mechanism, refracted stars); recurring cobalt residue charges final image, mirroring internal release. Sensory selection (light bands on face) purposefully narrows to crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (girl's "almost terrible" desperation) deepens accumulatively via patterns forcing confession/sitting; cost felt in tears and pending secret weight. Agency in guardian's weaving narrows girl's isolation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light-in-darkness emerges organically from shutter/mirror actions, reweighted in final "smallest light worth... making" without statement. Subtext in silence/gestures invites ambiguity on girl's path.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (pattern-focused noticing) with rhythmic modulation; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I almost—"). Compression in light descriptions taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences amid lyric flow); no loops, purposeful overwriting contained. "Spiralingly calm" risks minor strain but voice-integrated; propulsion peaks at spiral light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dental mirror + shutters synthesize fresh silent therapy, transforming tropes via specific mechanics; risk in pattern-weaving heightens stakes organically. Final image inevitable from setup.</comment>
