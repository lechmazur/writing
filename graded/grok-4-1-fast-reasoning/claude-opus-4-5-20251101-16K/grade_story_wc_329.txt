<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy intensifies through concrete micro-choice to play heart-rhythm music, earning her transformation; locust shell realization embodies internal conflict without epiphany dumps. Contradictory impulses (give vs. take) act in orchard scene, compelling higher-stakes play with felt cost of vulnerability to statues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from melody ripples to trees uprooting, culminating in Charged Poise RR as statues reposition and city stutters alive; cost legible in "uprooted more than trees" final image reconfiguring options from destruction to invitation. Orientation anchored early in sky-bridges; single arc with taught progression fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard statues and silver trees constrain choices, hesitating at heart-signal; final plaza grove charges closure image, mirroring internal states through swaying branches. Sensory selection (resonantly soft sound via heart) reflects POV urgency; no white-room, vivid economy throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening: statues advance but hesitate at non-threatening rhythm, trees choose to follow, narrowing mechanical vs. wonder divide. Agency in playing deeper forecloses destructive escape; cost felt in statues' confusion and city's stuttering hearts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of invitation over theft emerges implicitly via trees choosing to leave, reweighting "breaking free" in final orchard-planting image without moral state. Locust shell reprise shifts from empty armor to ornament, charging subtext of transformation; no tidy binaries, lingers with tarnished regrowth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in heart-rhythm noticing; diction/rhythm modulate with intensity ("barely louder than breath" to pulsing procession). Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure poise; no head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shell tumbling anchors realization and motif); rhythmic variety in read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative purposeful ("ripples in still water") without muddle in climax; propulsion peaks in uprooting procession.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-led magical procession transforming guardian statues; risk in non-violent subversion heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from shell motif. Core premise (heart-signal bypasses intention-sensors) feels organic, not templated.</comment>
