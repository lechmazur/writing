<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (charcoal grinding, ash in palms); contradictory impulses in preserving laugh via burning peak in scattering choice with emotional cost. Final renunciation of wholeness earned via ritual causality. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from grinding to scattering to rocking, closure as Charged Poise RR in echoing laugh with transformation cost legible in "not quite gone, not quite present." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gallery's vanishing point constrains scattering ritual and charges final image; mask/porcelain shards as micro-setting filter emotion, mirroring fragmentation. Sensory hierarchy (charcoal grit, flame heat, ash drift) selective via Mira's priorities; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grandmother's laugh) signaled early, textural escalation via burning deepens to emotional cost in tears/scattering; agency in ritual forecloses permanence. Subtle tightening fits lens but lacks sharp option-narrowing for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of illusion vs. transformation emerges via ash accumulation, reweighted in final rocking/echo without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in "ash became part of everything"; particulars like laugh-as-fish avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (tessellated world, fractured moonlight); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. "Shadows pooled like dark water" integrates without overwriting; rhythm breathes with ritual pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual gallery/ash transformation trope via tessellated mask and infinite depths; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes. Inevitable hindsight in laugh-echo reprise.</comment>
