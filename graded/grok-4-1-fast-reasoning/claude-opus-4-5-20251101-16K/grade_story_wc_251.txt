<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via hearing unspoken fears, embodied in chess coaching and display suggestions; motivation intensifies through grandmother's locket cue anchoring present endurance. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphanies ("rebellion... not always loud") borders therapy-speak but ties to micro-choices without flattening pressure. Final chess-board image earns change with felt cost of long-game patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fears, displays, and reflections builds to Charged Poise/CR in "mist closed around the library... town slept, dreaming in green," reweighting rebellion with conceptual cost of pause over victory. Orientation anchored early (library, Eve of Foundation). Single-shard reflective walk with legible transitions; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's magnetic tug mirrors conscience, constraining reflection and charging final "magnetic pull of possibility." Cobalt library and mist evolve tactilely (footsteps absorbed, embrace at end), filtered through POV's auditory gift. Sensory hierarchy selective (stars indifferent, windows glowing), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (second thoughts vs. factory) signaled early, tightens texturally via synchronized displays seen on walk, narrowing to Council's doubts. Agency in humble suggestions forecloses loud protest with cost of expected non-victory. Pressure coheres accumulatively; one deepening in grotto pause suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-voice emerges implicitly from displays, unspoken fears, chess resets; final "silence itself could speak" reconfigures without moralizing, reweighting quiet rebellion via locket and green dreams. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in long-game cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (unspoken whispers); rhythmic modulation peaks in "stars wheeled... hummed with magnetism," compressing under reflective stress. Prose texture distinct (lyric diction purposeful), no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful figurative layering (mist embrace, seeds of forests) taught early without muddle in closure. Minor synonym churn ("unspoken words") patterned, not looping; propulsion clear in walk beats. No scaffold or artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess coach's auditory gift sparks window-display rebellion, transforming protest trope via magnetic grotto and green motifs. Risk in quiet closure heightens stakes; no derivative hedging, inevitable in hindsight from particulars.</comment>
