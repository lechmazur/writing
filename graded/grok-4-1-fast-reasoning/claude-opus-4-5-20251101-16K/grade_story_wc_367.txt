<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's prophetic laugh and ritual reverence show consistent traits rooted in heritage, with the wick tilt as an earned micro-choice under subtle pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through ritual to Charged Poise closure in "tilted the wick three degrees toward hope," reconfiguring futures with felt ongoing cost; orientation anchors early, structure fits single-scene default seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald walls and volcanic wick constrain positioning choice and charge final humming resonance; sensory details (viridian reflections, starlight loop) filter through Mira's priorities, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of future-steering signaled early tightens accumulatively via pattern study to wick adjustment, narrowing paths with incremental cost; agency in tilt forecloses despair option legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of paths amid ambiguity emerges organically from shadows showing "rising waters—but also floating cities," answered non-literally by hope-tilted light flooding world; reweights priors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("light remembering its path") modulates rhythmically under ritual intensity; purposeful compression teaches pattern, pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and concrete images ("trapping luminescence in an endless loop"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere physically, rhythm varies naturally even in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-like light ritual steering futures transforms lighthouse trope through physics-magic logic; risk in shadowed hope risks feels inevitable, heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
