<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in grain-tracing and contradictory pull to follow vs. accept father's path; earned renunciation closes logbook with felt cost of separation. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "necessary distances had become her theology" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from logbook decoding to CR closure: "She understood now that she could not follow him," reweighting search with conceptual cost of transcendence. Orientation anchored immediately in terrace and backstory; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desk grain and prism terrace recur as micro-settings constraining reflection and charging final palm-press image; selective sensory details (rainbows on hands, landscapes below) mirror internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding father's message deepens accumulatively via cross-referencing, narrowing to realization that forecloses following him; agency in persistent analysis yields visible cost in acceptance, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from particulars like mazes and grain, answered non-literally in "design her own labyrinth—one without dead ends"; resonant reconfiguration reweights prior separations with ambiguity of bearable distances.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature tuned to labyrinthine patterns; rhythmic prose modulates from drifting hush to featherly resolve, perceptual bias character-specific without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel reflection without loops; purposeful lyric metaphors like "prismatic, patient" avoid muddle, though slight density in opening risks overwriting—untouched at closure palm-press.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze/pilot duality and grain-intuition method transforms loss trope into threshold quest; risk of drifting terrace heightens isolation stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
