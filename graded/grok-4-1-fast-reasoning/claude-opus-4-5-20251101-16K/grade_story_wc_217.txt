<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives the feather gift as an earned micro-choice with embodied grief-gratitude tension; girl's swift emotional pivot feels slightly convenient without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with feather-kite encounter tightening to Charged Poise closure in shared lagoon watch; cost legible in "something adjacent to [happiness]" reconfiguring loss with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lagoon's storm debris and wet sand constrain Maren's attentive choices and charge final image; sensory details (iridescence, wine-dark kite) filter through her poet's bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Girl's kite loss signals dominant emotional stake, deepened accumulatively by feather interaction narrowing sorrow to wonder; cost felt in acceptance but lacks sharper agency trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete beauty emerges from feather-kite parallel, resonating in final image's "loss and light" without moralizing; reweights premise organically via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "burnished hush") modulates with encounter; dialogue natural/subtextual, advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in opening imagery (e.g., "rinsed and gleaming"/"burnished hush") slightly dull propulsion before peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's remnant-gathering with child's loss transforms loss trope via iridescent feather reprise; risks lyric mode without gimmickry.</comment>
