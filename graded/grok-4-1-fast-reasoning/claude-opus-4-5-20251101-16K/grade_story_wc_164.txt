<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as recollectionist is rooted in gift/curse traits with embodied emotions like the warming glass; micro-choices following seeds reveal values under pressure. Final gathering earns change with felt cost of partial recovery. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak cave-heart beat keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seeds accumulate emotional fragments toward CR closure where crystals' indifference reconfigures path premise with conceptual cost of inevitable forgetting. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality via seed-trail tightens knowledge without breaks. Cost legible in "paths disappeared... but others could be walked again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iridescent geode constrains choices via seed-path and spires/forks; recurring crystals charge final image mirroring indifference to grief. Sensory details (whispering purples, humming golds) filter through Mira's emotional lens, evolving with descent. Body/tool (glass, palm on crystal) as micro-setting shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover fragments before fade) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations (joy to phantom's words), narrowing to conjecture at heart. Agency in following/gathering forecloses total recovery path with felt cost. No live option fully closed in climax tightens to 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-paths dissolving emerges from particulars (seeds, glass visions); final image reweights premise non-literally via crystals' rainbows-from-nothing. Subtext in woman's unvoiced phantom words invites ambiguity without morals. Resonant answer to "why paths disappear" inextricable from Mira's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (emotions as gasps, images); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity (short sentences in revelations). Purposeful compression in visions legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholdings. Voice distinct, prose reflects Mira's transliterative mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "purples that whispered" advances setting/voice/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figurative language purposeful (rainbows like tantrums) without muddle in peak. Final line recharges motifs cleanly; read-aloud flows with natural cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-transliteration via seeds/glass/geode transforms memory-loss trope into geode's indifferent witness. Risky fantasy conceit (paths dissolve when unwalked) feels inevitable via particulars; bold tone modulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closing reconfiguration grows organically from seeds.</comment>
