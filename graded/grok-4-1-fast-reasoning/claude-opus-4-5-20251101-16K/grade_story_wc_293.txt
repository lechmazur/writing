<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in inherited silence vs. bridge-song choice act on-page; final play earned by recount causality and shaking hands cost. Interiority particular via "bridge met absence"; no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment pattern (vanish, glass, mist) deepens to Charged Poise closure in fiddle play and lighter pocket—cost legible as "shared." Orientation anchored in first para; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trestle hum and gravel no-prints constrain observation/play and charge final mist image. Sensory selective via fiddler bias (humming cables, glint); micro-setting (fiddle, flake) lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("never" as lie) signaled early, tightens via photo realization forcing play agency; shaking hands and lighter fragment make cost visceral under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist "assembling... always possible" offers resonant non-literal answer to "never," reweighting fragments motif without moralizing. Theme emerges from particulars (Margaret lived, scaffold secret).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dynamically observant" catches no-prints/glint); rhythmic modulation peaks in charged poise at trestle hum. Stable single POV, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pixelated and deleted" opener); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors—no loops or muddle at closure play. Minor figurative density purposeful via pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler-ghost-photo transforms healing trope; "scaffold wrap flutters" secret inevitable from observant trait and fragment pattern, risks lyric closure payoff.</comment>
