<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in father's rhythm and bleaching memory, embodied via repeated tapping; interior conflict between report duty and tracing yields earned endurance at "She began typing her report, but she kept the atlas page beside her." Minor passivity limits contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tapping to manifests revelation; CR closure reconfigures loss into vigilant hope via "juvenile coral was beginning to grow," with legible conceptual cost in ocean's timescale vs. human lifetime. Orientation anchored early; one tightening revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station as micro-setting constrains vigil, fog/aluminum desk sensory details mirror fogged realization; recurring atlas charges final image. "The station drifted on its moorings" evolves causally, filtering through Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel father's routes) signaled early, revelation deepens via manifests into inherited witness role; agency in cross-referencing forecloses distraction path with cost of indifferent rising waters. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed paths/loss/return emerges organically from atlas/routes/coral; final "Some paths return" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting human amends vs. ocean eternity. Complexity lingers in "white silence of loss."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic prose echoing taps; diction modulates from hummed monitors to fogged clarity, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with tapping motif, high density integrates reflection/action; no loops/artifacts, minor repetition ("tapped the rhythm") voice-motivated. "Fog that pressed against the station windows like something trying to remember its own name" propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sailor maps as reef evidence and tapping inheritance transforms climate grief trope; juvenile coral hope inevitable from prior bleaching particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
