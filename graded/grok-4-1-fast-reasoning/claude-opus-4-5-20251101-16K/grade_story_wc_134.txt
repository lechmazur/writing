<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's interior contradiction peaks in "Her gift had become her blindness," with contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. descent) acting simultaneously, earning the pearl-taking choice with embodied tears and weakened knees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crystal music and shadows densify toward Charged Poise closure; pilgrim's "When did you last let yourself be surprised?" reconfigures Vera's foresight with legible emotional cost in the unrepeatable chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Musical crystals and "bright darkness" constrain perception and charge the final image, with sensory hierarchy (vibrations as colors) filtered through Vera's third eye bias, evolving causally with descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover wonder) tightens via unseen forces' agitation and unforeseen pearl, narrowing Vera's immunity; agency in reaching for the pearl forecloses her old stance, with cost felt in life's review glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl's pulse reweights premise of foresight-as-blindness into "inhabit wonder...as its student," emergent from particulars without moralizing; final image resonates via shifted cave song, inviting ambiguity on mystery's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("notes vibrate through her sternum, each pitch a different color") sustained under pressure; dialogue subtextual ("You've spent forty years showing others wonder"), distinguishing voices idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm accelerating in revelation ("Tears slid down her weathered cheeks"); purposeful figuratives like "bright darkness" clarify without muddle, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Messenger-pilgrim twist synthesizes clairvoyance tropes into fresh "forces had sent their own pilgrim," growing organically from shadows; risk in lyric wonder payoff heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
