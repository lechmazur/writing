<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "sleep required surrender, and she could not surrender because grief would drown her," earning final endurance as charged poise without tidy epiphany; interiority poetic yet particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from vigil to armistice; CR closure in "I came home after all" reconfigures longing with cost of wakefulness legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell's spiraling acoustics constrain song's reach and charge final hum; bioluminescent gardens and ocean filter through Mira's poetic bias, evolving to dawn light payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of pain-to-beauty tightens accumulatively via armistice "blossom," forcing endurance; global pressure deepens personal cost, legible in "she still could not sleep."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pain-metabolizing images to resonant poem reweighting "home"; no moralizing, ambiguity in joy lingers via "dappled and patient."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, perceptual signature oceanic/poetic; stable third-limited POV biases toward biolum and echoes without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion in "photosynthesize pain into beauty" refrain varies purposefully; no loops, metaphors cohere (anemones to coral), rhythm reads aloud seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood poet's vigil transmuting grief via shell-songs; risk in lyric expanse heightens stakes, inevitable in "she had become the dream."</comment>
