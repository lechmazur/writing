<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's backstory-rooted motivation to quantify absence compels micro-choices like incising trees under parole constraint; contradictory impulse to understand endures with visible cost in final restraint, fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to Charged Poise closure; parole cost legible in "never step through," with early orientation anchoring glass orchard vividly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass trees and cloud-sea constrain incising/measuring actions and charge final "trembling" image; sensory details filter through Mira's absence-attuned perception without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Parole stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via measurements, customer service, and final endurance; one deepening forecloses overreach with felt opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absence-as-beginning theme emerges from quantifying acts and customer mercy; final orchard-tending reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity on patience's sufficiency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers perceptual signature of potential-filled voids; stable close-third POV biases noticing consistently, modulating rhythm to heighten poised closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High-density lines integrate image/action without loops or muddle; varied rhythm propels meditative beats, with metaphors like "ripe fruit" coherent and propulsing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh premise of story orchards as absence yields organic synthesis; glass trees/glimmering parole transform tropes riskily, heightening stakes inevitably to closure.</comment>
