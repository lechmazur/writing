<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs. repair) act simultaneously in embodied reactions like throat tightening and pillbox warmth; final choice to join earned by causal buildup, foreclosing isolation with relational cost at handoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of codes, pillbox, dialogue revelations tighten toward RR/Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "pressed the pillbox into his palm," reconfiguring frozen cowardice with undeniable shame handover.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, bluff edge, snow codes constrain approach and charge final image ("silver hush"); sensory hierarchy (breath silver, thawing scent) mirrors internal thaw via Maren's biased priorities, evolving with mist thinning to reveal stakes below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem courage) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Yusuf's blade-like words and pillbox confrontation; agency in hand-taking forecloses disappearance path with felt relational/emotional price under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "fixing what's broken" emerges from particulars (snow codes, pillbox inheritance, bluff tilt); final image non-literally answers via charged reprise of frozen-to-thawing reconfiguration, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (codes in snow, bluff winds); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You left me..."), distinct voices (neutral Yusuf vs. tight Maren), modulates rhythm under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration ("breath silver," "clouds roll beneath like a second sea"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (mist gauze, amber cowardice) cohere without muddle in peak handoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy tropes via prudently daring redemption and snow-code ghosts; pillbox reprise transforms inheritance into courage calculus, risking quiet closure that heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
