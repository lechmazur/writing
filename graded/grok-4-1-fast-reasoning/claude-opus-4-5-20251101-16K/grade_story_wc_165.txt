<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's analytical compulsion shines through concrete interiority like calculating tides and cataloging failures, with contradictory impulses in embracing randomness yet ordering it; final endurance of his method feels earned without tidy epiphany. Flawless embodiment avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early pattern-teaching via interventions building to CR closure in tide's retreat and bishop turn-over, reweighting compulsion under indifferent stars with conceptual cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchored immediately; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains timing and reveals mosaics to charge final image, with stars' indifference mirroring stakes; selective sensory details like lapping water filter through Marcus's priorities without catalog excess. Micro-setting via steps and water levels guides choreography perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ordering monotony tightens texturally through intervention density and failure notation, narrowing to endurance with felt cost in ratios pleasing him yet endless tomorrow; agency in precise drops and retreats coheres pressure without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of serendipity vs. chaos emerges organically from particulars like bishop drop and paper boat, culminating in resonant CR where tide/stars reweight creativity's fragile flicker without moralizing. Ambiguity in failures invites counter-reading on meaning's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric observations; rhythmic prose modulates from precise calculations to charged poise at end. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven in bishop exchange revealing husband-wife reconnection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—e.g., "diagonal mover" precise and voice-fit. Final image's cadence shift recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess analogy and tidal reset transforms street-performer trope into analytical compulsion; risk in vignette mosaic heightens ingenuity, with bishop interventions feeling inevitable to closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
