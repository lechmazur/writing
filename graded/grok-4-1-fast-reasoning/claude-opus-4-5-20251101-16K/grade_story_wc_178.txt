<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's frugality and devotion create embodied contradiction—reusing charts yet splurging on lenses—compelling her patient encoding at closure with visible cost of regime threats. Interiority particular: "counting stars and counting coins with equal precision." Final choice earned by lifelong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tile tracing to nebula alignment as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her devotion with cost of impermanence ("Tomorrow, another regime might claim"). Orientation anchored early in observatory/Babylon; closure legible on-page with tile on ledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains: Babylonian chamber enables tile claim, telescope on deck aligns with nebula; dust motes "like distant galaxies" charges final harmony image. Sensory selective via POV: amber slits filter light mirroring internal dusk. Micro-object (tile) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncloak sequence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to equinox countdown—"precisely forty minutes"—forcing endurance with tears as felt cost; nebula reconfigures knowledge. Agency in patient positioning telescope narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion emerges organically: priests' encoding mirrors her schematics and final square, final image ("began encoding her own observations") resonantly reweights endurance over empires without moralizing. Complexity in empirical mysticism lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable, perceptual signature astronomical ("stars emerging like scattered salt"); rhythmic control modulates from precise buildup to charged "She wept." Voice texture distinct, biased to celestial bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "frugal astronomer by necessity and nature" advances char/prose); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors ("amber tears") taught early without muddle in peak nebula beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic square as dynamic stellar encoder transforms mysticism empirically; Babylonian revival setting + frugal devotion yield inevitable "covenant" reconfiguration. Risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
