<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied forgetting (chalk nubs, driftwood arrows), with blind spots compounding via self-markers; motivation consistent but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the sphere-listening beat for peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs accumulate to sphere discovery, CR closure in "the sound was gone" with felt cost of eternal slippage; one tightening via path convergence, orientation anchored early in fog garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sphere as micro-setting constrains listening action and charges final hearing/loss image; fog/sculptures selectively sensory (breathes, ghosts), POV-filtered (sacred forgetting), no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate/capture aging echo) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to sphere hearing then loss; agency in marking forecloses capture with legible cost, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of elusive echoes emerges via particulars (visions dissolving, mother's voice frequency), resonant CR in final marking reweights endless search without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature (tidal visions, sacred junk) rhythmic under pressure; diction modulates to charged poise in sphere moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy hearings amid flow), no loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful (fog as grief) without muddle in peak sphere beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precog-forgetting prophet chasing inaudible aging sounds transforms loss tropes; risk in solo accumulative quest heightens inevitability of cyclic closure.</comment>
