<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable's monthly personality molting and constancy in reconstruction earn a credible endurance with felt cost in her poem placement and response to Marcus, but internal contradictions play more as backstory labels than simultaneous scene impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise CR in the final image of the library waiting patiently as seeds root, reweighting resistance with conceptual cost of fragmentation and time; orientation anchors immediately in rusted library under moon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains choices like tarping vulnerable shelves and charges final image of open-roofed star-touched sanctuary, with sensory details (oxidizing shelves, silver moonlight) woven into action and mirroring internal fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of blooming resistance tightens accumulatively via poem placement deepening witness into potential action, forcing endurance with legible cost in patience and ongoing anarchy; agency in micro-choices like hiding poems coheres pressure without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creation over collapse emerges organically from particulars like penny poems on injustices and rebuilding wreckage, with final CR image resonating non-literally on fractures letting in light without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature in poetic bias toward beauty in ruin; dialogue natural/subtextual ("Who are you this month?") distinguishes voices and advances stakes without indirection overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic prose accelerating through work beats and breathing in reflective pauses; minor figurative density ("wounded cathedral") fits taught lyric pattern without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vagrant poet rebuilding open library transforms tropes of homelessness/resistance into inevitable acts of witness, with risk-taking in accumulative lyric form heightening stakes organically.</comment>
