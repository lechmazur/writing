<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotions and micro-choices shine in the freeze at the cliff edge, where somatic anchors reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Quiet talent constraint enables plant coaxing with visible endurance cost at closure. Minor ding for diagnostic labels like "somatic markers" bordering therapy-speak without full embodiment in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory layering and holds to Charged Poise closure in folding the photo and returning to seedlings, reconfiguring recovery to navigation with felt cost of "aliveness of her grief." Single scene oriented by arboretum/cliff by para 2. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cliff-edge platform and soil under nails constrain freeze navigation, charging final seedling image. Sensory hierarchy (salt spray narrowing vision) reflects POV urgency. Lighthouse automation mirrors theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief navigation signaled early tightens accumulatively to pearl of stillness, forcing endurance trade-off with cost legible in "lungs forgot their rhythm" persisting to held photo. Protagonist agency in letting freeze happen narrows to present reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of optimism through realism emerges organically from photo/seed/light beam images, reweighted non-literally in final tending act without moralizing. Jasmine/seeds reprise shifts from loss to reaching light, embracing grief complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in somatic noticing (earth under nails, spray on lips). Rhythmic modulation builds to compression in freeze breaths. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops, though minor synonym churn in grief descriptors ("freeze," "locking"). "Dust had settled on white lace like gray snow" exemplifies clean propulsion. Zero artifacts in peak freeze/ending beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of somatic grief work in cliff arboretum transforms PTSD tropes via botany navigation. Risky lyric stasis on "aliveness of her grief" heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; lighthouse automation inflects human tenderness uniquely.</comment>
