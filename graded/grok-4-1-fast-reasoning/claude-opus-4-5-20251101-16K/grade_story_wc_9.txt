<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary interior contradiction in doubting her right to climb yet proceeding; micro-choices like offering the saucer reveal hierarchy of values under grief's pressure. Embodied emotion peaks in "choking beauty pressed against her throat until breathing became an act of faith." Final renunciation of breaking earned by causal buildup of fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cloud rise and saucer reflection delivers Conceptual Repricing—"Lost time... gathered in the broken places"—with legible cost of choosing stasis. Orientation anchored immediately in ladder climb to glade. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Midnight glade's silver grass and rising clouds constrain kneeling/offer and charge final embrace; bone ladder and saucer as micro-settings alter ascent and realization. Sensory hierarchy (taste of starlight, mist pooling) reflects cartomancer's priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from climb to descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming time tightens via deepening reflection in luminous saucer, forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable in foreclosing further loss—"choosing, finally, to stop breaking." Agency in palm-pressing crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time in fractures emerges organically from saucer crack holding mercury-time; final image of tracing hands non-literally answers loss without moralizing, reweighting premise. Subtext in grief's release layers ambiguity of mending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature—"stars hung so close she could taste their light"; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in cloud sequence. No elision or head-hopping; diction reflects cartomancer's ink-soul.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud, peaking in "clouds began to rise." Figuratives coherent and purposeful, no muddle in realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repentance glade and time pooling in cracks transforms grief tropes; risk in lyric CR closure inevitable from saucer motif. Bold perceptual idiom avoids safety median.</comment>
