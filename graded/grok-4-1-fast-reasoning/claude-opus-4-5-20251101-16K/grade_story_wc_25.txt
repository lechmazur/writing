<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's expertise shines through embodied micro-choices like refolding maps and probing with the key, rooting motivation in consistent traits; internal faith-skill tension emerges subtly in coin ruse. Blind spots balanced by genuine struggle against shifting maze. Final endurance of her shadowed role earned with storm cost, satisfying 9+ test without closure slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm → disorientation → search via maps/whispers → girl found before surge. Orientation anchored early ("container labyrinth... port city"). Closure as Charged Poise in "pockets the key... planning tomorrow's routes," reconfiguring mastery with legible surge cost ("first waves lapping"). Persistent constraint (maze shifts) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers as micro-setting constrain choices (gaps for whispers/probing) and charge final image (refolding amid fading aurora). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sound over sight via "whispers travel farther"). Weather (storm surge) evolves causally, pressuring outcome; aurora pulses integrate action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue before midnight surge) signaled early, tightens causally via signs/rat-wrapper → hollow echo → voice response, narrowing options with time pressure. Agency in ruse ("I found your coin") forces girl out; cost felt in surge lap and deeper maze risk. Escalation driven by protagonist under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of skill over fate emerges organically via coin ruse and map refolds, culminating in resonant final image ("labyrinth had whispered its secrets") reweighting luck premise without moral. Subtext in "faith made people predictable" layers ambiguity. No tidy resolution; her unrecognized endurance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (walks, sounds, folds); diction/rhythm modulate pressure (whispers vs. aurora blaze). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Scorpios trust too much in fate"), goal-driven. No head-hopping; compression legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "turned the zodiac coin between her fingers. The girl had faith in luck, then."). Rhythms vary (short stress beats: "A small voice emerged."); no loops, artifacts, or overwriting in peak (probing echo). Zero issues touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: container maze as breathing entity navigated via walks/maps/whispers transforms rescue trope; calculated spontaneity feels inevitable. Risk in storm-time constraint heightens stakes organically. Coin ruse adds non-obvious ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
