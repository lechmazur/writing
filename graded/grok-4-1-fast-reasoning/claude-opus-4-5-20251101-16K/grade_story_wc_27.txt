<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid embodied interiority peaks in palm-on-stone vibration rising through bones, earning shift from doubt to certainty; awkward confidence trait mostly shown via persistent solo actions but early label slightly dilutes contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibration density builds from feet to circle-walk to light-threads CR, reconfiguring lull with her isolation cost legible in "walks barefoot into the darkness"; orientation anchors early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bare feet on "cold metal floor" tactilely constrain navigation over beams to warm stones, evolving with hum; opera glasses as micro-setting charge closure by revealing "threads of light... like a map"; selective sensory hierarchy fits Mira's vibration bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reigniting amid lull escalates via hum intensification during circle-walk, forcing agency in memorizing pattern; under Accum lens, cadence shift narrows to carrying burden alone, with cost felt in nightfall isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stones vs paved Authority emerges organically as roots reweighting crumbled rebellion; final "memorized pattern... hope encoded in geometry" non-literally answers meaning-in-mess without moralizing, resonating via geometric image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in subsurface "vibrations" and "hum... through her bones"; rhythmic prose modulates from scanning calm to "thunderous serenity," heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring hum build; minor figurative stack like "ribbons of dying gold... thunderous serenity" risks overwrite in opener but coheres with tonal payoff, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ancient stone circle under spaceport fuses sci-fi rebellion with settler mysticism ingeniously, transforming lull via vibration-map; barefoot persistence risks bold solitude without gimmick.</comment>
