<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reaper's interiority vividly embodied in "hollow chest" and silent lip-echoing, with contradictory silence-duty versus Mira's urging compelling the final micro-choice to speak fears aloud; earned endurance of grief with visible cost in "heart remained broken."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as recording playback densifies reflections into crystallization, yielding Charged Poise closure where reaper gathers crystals and plans soul-naming, cost legible in enduring broken heart against night sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusk observatory's brass mechanisms and crystal prisms constrain the pivotal crystallization via scattered light, charging final image of atlas page beside device as dusk yields to stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nameless fears tightens accumulatively through voice-made-visible crystals, forcing reaper's stance crystallization in gathering them for souls; cost felt in "broken things could still love" without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears emerges organically from map monsters to crystallized terrors, final line "love...another name for a fear that had been faced" reweighting premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
