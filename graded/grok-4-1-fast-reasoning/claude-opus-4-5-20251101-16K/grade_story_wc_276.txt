<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's cool-headed patience and emotion-transliteration trait drive micro-choices like voicing silence amid madness, earning the catch with sanity's cost embodied in calloused palms and stillness. Contradictory impulses (feral lullaby's savage tenderness) act in the reeling beat without tidy resolution. Final transliteration reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from casting to jerk to reeling, with pattern break (constellations) enabling Decisive Change (echo caught) and Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "held firm" against wild zigzag. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sound wave garden's crystalline structures constrain casting and reeling, with rail spike as tactile micro-setting handled across beats. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations, tastes like salt) biases to Maren's fisher priorities, charging final "settled back into crystalline stillness." Final basket image evolves environment tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early tightens via jerk and voicing under timeframe pressure, narrowing escape options with agency in "continued voicing silence." Cost unmistakable in endured madness and anchored spike. Escalation accumulates density to closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of breaking/remaking patterns emerges implicitly from garden falter, voiced echo ("patterns must break themselves"), and humming reprise, reweighting silence's power without statement. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer via feral lullaby modulating savage/gentle costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (emotions as frequency, silence voiced) biases noticing to harmonics and voids, with rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences at jerk). Lyrical diction reflects Maren's transliterative mind consistently. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., spike "remembers vibration" advances tool and world); metaphors coherent (purple-gray howl) without muddle in climax. Rhythm varies (long hypnotic opens to punchy "line jerk hard"); zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fishing myth with sonic surrealism (voicing silence via rail spike) transforms tropes organically, with risk in lyric compression heightening pattern-break stakes. Inevitable hindsight from spike's vibration memory to echo embrace.</comment>
