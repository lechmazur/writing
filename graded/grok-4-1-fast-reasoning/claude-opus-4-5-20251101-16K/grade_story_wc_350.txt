<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in empathy drives decisive actions like song and weight-passing; interiority concrete via heart cataloguing fractures. Secondary characters apply collective pressure through stories without deep individualization, fitting scope. Large cast coheres but dilutes singular micro-choices slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: story density builds via circulating weight and braided memories, tightening to Charged Poise in shared clock-chime silence. Orientation anchored early in tower and town silos. Closure reconfigures silos with felt communal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower's mechanisms and zodiac wheel constrain gathering and mirror mending; starlight filters hush the scene. Sensory details (creaking brass, borrowed light) charge final harmony image. Spatial circle choreography clear amid crowd.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging silos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through song recognition and story-sharing reversal narrowing wariness. Mira's agency forces communal crystallization; cost legible in passed weight's ancestral pulls. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voices mending fractures emerges from particulars like reconstructed hymn and traveling weight, without statement. Final image of unified silence reweights silos non-literally. Resonance from irony of neutral tower revealing hidden bridges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Mira's perceptual signature (loneliness as stone cold, voices as mechanisms). Lyrical voice modulates tenderly; multilingual dialogue natural, subtextual in greetings. Rhythmic control heightens hush-to-harmony shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in "voices had begun to braid together." Purposeful lyric figures (starlight dissolving into dawn) without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opener purposeful for tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral librarian wielding clock weight to mend silos in astro-tower transforms community trope organically. Risky crowd choreography heightens ingenuity; final weight-on-altar inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
