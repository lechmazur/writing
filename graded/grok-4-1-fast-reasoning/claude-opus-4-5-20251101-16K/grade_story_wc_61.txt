<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vael's contradictory grief and stubborn hope act simultaneously in reflections on 17k failures versus spore release, earning the final endurance with felt cost in gear pressed into palm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pings build density of patterns, culminating in Charged Poise closure via final petal's mathematical progressions reconfiguring eternal hope against repetition, with cost legible in "grief that never stilled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains transit via sonar and enables spore cultivation, charging final petal image that mirrors internal patterns and forecloses tidy escape from cycles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to break fire cycle tightens accumulatively via colony ping ("no fire yet"), forcing spore release as agency with visible cost of inherited failures weighting every action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of spores rooting versus sparks striking offers resonant non-literal answer to generational burning, reweighting patterns through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature fixates on patterns in light/gear/petal, with rhythmic control modulating serenity to grief under pressure; stable single POV fits accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful "ping" refrain; no loops, coherent metaphors (fire as "teacher that devours"), clarity intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cosmic sentimentalist synthesizing god-watcher trope with bioluminescent alternatives feels inevitable via gear/petal synthesis, risking lyric sci-fi for fresh pattern-break hope.</comment>
