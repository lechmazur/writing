<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's grief-bodied motivation shines in the button discovery tying to her daughter, earning endurance; minor telling in reflective summaries slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from dust/file to button to next-file poise; closure as Charged Poise lands in "The work continued," reconfiguring her stake with felt cost of irrecoverable losses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust patterns as micro-setting constrain choices ("reading the dust before she even touched") and charge final image; sensory integration (hum, spirits-dust) mirrors internal neglect without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to magnify kindnesses tightens via button deepening personal cost; endurance agency forecloses forgetting with visible price in her loss, coherent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved kindness emerges via particulars (button, tab); final image non-literally answers via "echoed forward," reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("dust like released spirits") biases toward hidden textures; stable close-third modulates rhythmically with quiet pressure, pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels; minor "small kindnesses" echoes purposeful, not looping; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-driven archival lyricism transforms forgotten-files trope; button's war-tie and dust-method risk bold quiet closure payoff.</comment>
