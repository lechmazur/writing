<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through scars as "ridged maps" and child's "rivers," with contradictory fire-love impulses acting in ritual choices; final endurance of heritage earned via on-page offering with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure in "her own element entire," scattering sand as felt conceptual cost reweighting legacy; orientation anchored early in dunes/lagoon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon's "dark mirror" and black sand constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (firefighter pressure-sense) filters clouds/sand purposefully, mirroring internal depth without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing vs. father's ash) signaled early, textural deepening via coin-lowering narrows to renunciation with legible cost in sand-offering; agency in ritual forecloses destructive path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from graft/scars/fire-water particulars, final coin-kiss reweights premise non-literally as Charged Poise without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in shared "heat, hunger" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (firefighter "whisper of change"); rhythmic modulation builds to lyric poise, purposeful compression taught early via cloud metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels to closure; coherent metaphors (kelp-drift, aerial whales) purposeful without muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling sand-scatter image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-firefighter graft in obsidian ritual transforms legacy trope; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes via irreplaceable lagoon/coin, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
