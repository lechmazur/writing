<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between immortality's anchor and obsession culminate in earned release of amulet; "pain... sharp, mortal beauty" embodies rare felt cost without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising to rift tear and CR closure; "Vael stepped forward" and amulet drop seal legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic walls constrain rift via thinnest overlap and fracture during storm, charging empty sanctuary's rainbow image; sensory bleed mirrors internal erosion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively as storm feeds rift against curse opposition; agency in pressing/releasing fragment forecloses immortality with pain as felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>CR reweights "what happens after goodbye?" via "profound, terrifying peace" emerging from particulars, not statement; final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cosmic perceptual signature ("boundaries of space beginning to strain"); rhythmic modulation heightens rift pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery like "violet consuming gold"; varied rhythm, no loops or muddle obscure climax step-through.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny via storm transforms immortal-trope breach into fresh synthesis; risky CR ending heightens dimensional stakes organically.</comment>
