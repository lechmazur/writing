<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stellar patterns layer to dream redistribution and CR closure: "felt Oren's absence as something she could carry—not alone"; cost legible in final telegram image reweighting premise, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's brass instruments and telescope constrain decoding choice; recurring daylily telegram charges final image, mirroring internal shift from faded petals to morning light; sensory hierarchy reflects Vera's priorities without catalog.</comment>
