<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rescue arts is embodied through baking and teaching, with contradictory dread/hope acting in the spotting of the daughter; final endurance of loss via successor earned by prior traditions. Minor reflection exceeds brief fragments but anchors to present choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via thawing veil and traditions building density to Charged Poise closure (successor integrates, reconfiguring preservation); cost legible in "rosewater dread" persisting amid hope, with one tightening at daughter's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto and waterfall constrain exposure stakes, emerald lens charges opening/closing images; sensory details (dripping halls, golden bread) filter through Mira's historical bias, evolving with thaw to mirror internal thaw of dread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultural survival amid thaw/exposure and supply loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to daughter's arrival narrowing isolation; agency in welcoming her forecloses self-reliant path with felt cost of Tomasz's death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory consumption emerges organically from bread-shaping and lens; final image (lens beside warm bread) offers resonant reconfiguration of loss into inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (emerald tint as memory) stable in single POV; brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Katya's question reveals transmission), rhythm modulates from dread to poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, varied syntax; "rosewater dread" motif consistent without muddle, but minor paraphrase loops in reflective passages (e.g., preservation repeated adjacently) dull momentum slightly pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile via tactile customs (initial-bread) transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes through thawing concealment without gimmickry.</comment>
