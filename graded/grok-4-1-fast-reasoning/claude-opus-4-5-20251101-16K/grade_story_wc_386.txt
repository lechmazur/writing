<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to salvage purity drives micro-choices like weaving truth gradually, embodied in her cautious dialogue with Elsa; internal conflict surfaces in weighing exposure versus carving, earning the final renunciation with felt cost to her labor. Ghost's hunger and innocence feel particular through flickering form. Contradictory impulses act in the exposure decision, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal revelations accumulate texturally) holds to Charged Poise closure: Mira's carving reconfigures Elsa's memory with glacier's permanence as cost. Orientation anchors by para 2 (shrine, Mira's trades). Dream analysis causality tightens to decisive truth without breaks; cost legible in "ice cracked—a sound like breathing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine constrains ritual (descent, carving) and charges final image (truth into ancient ice). Sensory selectivity (blue ice silence, steady flames) reflects Mira's wreck-diver bias; ice cracking mirrors release. Micro-setting (snow globe, candles) evolves causally, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free Elsa's memory) signaled early, tightens via dream evidence narrowing blame; agency in calibrated revelation forces trade-off (expose living vs. carve ice). Cost unmistakable in ghost's dissolution and Mira's ongoing dives. Escalation coherent under hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges organically via warped globe and carved innocence; final image (globe as "borrowed starlight") reweights premise without moral, satisfying 9+ test. Subtext in father's grief calcifies via particulars, lingering ambiguity on living's reception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with wreck-diver perceptual signature (rope fibers, corroded artifacts); voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive to charged ("ice cracked—a sound like breathing"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing Elsa's everywhere-voice. No head-hopping, 9+ rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Mira weaves truth carefully" anchors trait/action); rhythm varies read-aloud, metaphors coherent (borrowed light recurs without muddle). Zero loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream-sourced ghost-whispering transforms tropes; glacier-as-archivist risks bold payoff in carving closure. Non-obvious angle on blame (children easy targets) feels inevitable from particulars; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
