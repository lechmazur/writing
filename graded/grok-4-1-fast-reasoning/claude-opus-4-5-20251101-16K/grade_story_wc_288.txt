<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in consistent witness-grief, intensifying to compel independence choice; contradictory ease vs. purpose impulses act in ghost dialogues, earning final absorption with cellular cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ghost density builds knowledge, tightening to RR closure at "ghosts began to fade, not into oblivion but into her," reconfiguring grief with foundation cost; orientation anchored early in library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal library's ebbing shelves and stone circle hum constrain transformation choices, charging final dawn via sundial; sensory selection (hum, shifting clouds) mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs. unmaking) signaled early, accumulates via multiplying ghosts forcing "isolation into independence" crystallization; agency in reframing forecloses mourning path with internalized loss cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges from ghost challenges and absorption, resonant non-literal answer in "we coexist... we always will" reweighting prior extinctions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature (impossible reflections, cosmic rhythms); ghost dialogue subtext-driven, distinct from Elara's lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and images like "tusks swept through volumes without disturbing them"; minor figurative density in ghost peak purposeful without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation witness and extinction ghosts in tidal library transforms grief tropes; risk-taking in absorptive closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
