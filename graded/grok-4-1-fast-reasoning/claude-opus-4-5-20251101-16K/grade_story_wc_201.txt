<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancements embody trauma as "coordinates of agony," fueling concrete mercy data points; contradictory pursuit of formula yields weeping realization, earning strap-hanging closure with survival guilt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as trauma responses build mercy pattern to CR in clearing; orientation anchored early in Penance Grove; cost legible in "penance wasn't for what she'd done. It was for surviving."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV forest's pulsing indigo/violet constrains triggers (ozone, branches), mirroring internal fragmentation; body as micro-setting via proprioception charges final pulse "like a heartbeat learning to forgive."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mercy math stake tightens via deliberate worst-memory trigger in columns, deepening biological imperative insight; agency forecloses tidy redemption, with embodied seizure cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mercy as "thresholds" emerges from strap, water, "I'm sorry" particulars; final forest pulse reweights penance premise into human persistence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fuses math precision ("frequencies human eyes shouldn't perceive") with sensory waves; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm under peak stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "trauma responses had become her only reliable memory access" propels without loops; figurative "pain had become geometry" purposeful, rhythm varies with awareness waves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Mathematics of mercy" synthesizes enhancements/UV into fresh survival calculus; strap offering risks bold CR, transforming tropes with irreplaceable conceptual heartbeat.</comment>
