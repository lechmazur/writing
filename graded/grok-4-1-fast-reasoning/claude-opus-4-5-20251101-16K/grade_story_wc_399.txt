<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sev's motivation to preserve echoes drives ritual choices with embodied cost (knees tremble, scarred face revealed on mask removal), earning the closure's stasis. Strangely honest trait shown in raw admission ("They never are") forces relational pressure with Mahl. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak ritual slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: murmurs build density to hush, parapet cycle tightens urgency, closure RR via clearing's crystallization and pavilion silence with legible cost (Sev's scars). Orientation anchored early (Sev arrives at pavilion post-prophet). No causality breaks; persistent constraint of decay shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's folding interior and murmurs constrain ritual, charging final silence image; half-mask forces divided vision for consecration. Sensory hierarchy (whispers to hush) reflects Sev's peripheral awareness. Parapet breaches surface to guard, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve decaying wisdom) signaled early, escalates via parapet motion narrowing time ("hours, perhaps"), forcing Sev's ritual agency. Accumulative deepening reweights via murmurs condensing; cost felt in trembling knees and implied memory forfeiture, charging closure poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes preserved across endings/beginnings emerges organically from ritual condensation and final silence reweighting initial murmurs. Prophet's trigger integrates concept without statement; scars tie personal cost to wisdom's endurance. Resonant non-literal answer in "satisfied quiet of purpose achieved."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (peripheral awareness biasing notice); voice rhythm modulates from rippling tension to calm hush. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Mahl's doubt vs. Sev's honesty advances stakes). Diction controlled, prose texture reflects ritual mind-state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "half-mask... forcing the brain to reconcile two ways of seeing" advances setting/character/action). Varied rhythm propels to peak hush; no loops, artifacts, or muddled figures. Final image "gentle hum... eternal rest" recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic failsafe, peripheral ritual, echo-preservation transforms fantasy tropes via specific mechanics (conjured clearings as memory trade). Risky quiet closure heightens conceptual stakes; irreplaceable world logic (parapet guards new sanctuary) feels inevitable.</comment>
