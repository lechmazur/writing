<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in watching shadows' beauty versus duty peak when chest aches with unnamed regret; final guiding choice earned by stone's warmth and grandmother's legacy, foreclosing destruction with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as footage shards build pattern knowledge to Charged Poise closure; stone pressed to forehead anchors realization, with regret as legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming library's twilight boundary and rose-tinted shelves constrain shadow tracking and hope-preservation choices; river stone as micro-setting cools certainty then warms to charge decision moment.</comment>
