<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chronically curious trait roots motivation and compels climactic choice to speak star-names, earning memory return with embodied grief ("wept among the salt-stunted trees") as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observational density builds to pattern detection and ring-standing DC/RR; closure lands on-page at "The memories returned like a tide" with bittersweet reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain time via rising tide, charging final bark touch; selective sensory details (algae-slicked flagstones, brine air) mirror internal recovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early tightens via constellation study under accumulative lens, forcing agency in ring; cost unmistakable in grief-relief braid and submerging pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming personal legend emerges organically from avoidance break to "carrying her own legend home"; final image non-literally reweights curiosity's curse with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with folklorist perceptual signature ("observe, document, connect"); rhythmic control modulates from crisp observation to charged remembrance without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful similes ("half-drowned cathedral"); no loops or artifacts dull closure image of bark-pressed hand.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy ring lore with broken-constellation cipher transforms trope; risk in tidal submersion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
