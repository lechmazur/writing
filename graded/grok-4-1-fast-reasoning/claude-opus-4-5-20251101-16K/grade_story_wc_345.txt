<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's actions—digging the bell, ringing it to silence arguments—reveal hierarchy of values, earning her leadership choice with cost of abandonment; ghost's altruism is particular via botanist backstory anchored to present dig.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds via dawn messages to charged poise closure (fleet rises, ghost fades) with legible cost in crumbling planet and release; shards taught early, lens holds seamlessly.</comment>
