<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's reactively visionary gift is embodied with concrete costs (headaches, staggered intervals) that constrain her choices; motivation rooted in grandmother's silenced voice earns her final reconfiguration from restoration to navigation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment visions build density to CR closure in final harbor image, reweighting purpose with legible conceptual cost of incompleteness; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor's pale stone and sea-stain details constrain archival decay and charge final rain image; recurring rain and trumpet valve as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming history tightens accumulatively via pardon discovery and family impacts; agency in staggered revelations forecloses full restoration with felt cost of gaps, charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in absences emerges organically from visions and silences, final image repricing restoration as navigation without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature filters decay through archivist bias; rhythmic prose modulates with reflective intensity, no head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid, purposeful sensory integration (slick stone, corroded brass); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, zero loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary archival power navigating historical erasures transforms trope of restoration; trumpet valve reprise risks bold conceptual turn, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
