<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing bugs) acting in the child's appearance and lava-watching beat. Final renunciation earned by prior backstory anchors and micro-choices like opening satchel. Wealth-to-destitution arc shows blind spots compounding into felt cost of emptiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from beach hush to moons' alignment and bug release, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing where release reconfigures her premise of transformation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (beach, volcano, satchel). Child's brief intervention tightens without causality break; cost legible in "empty-handed at last."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Black sand "still warm," volcano's "incandescent orange" lava thread, and bug glow constrain choices (walk to base, bugs to edge) and charge final image of gentled flow. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's transformation focus, narrowing to lava's "texture." Atmosphere's vibrant hush evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gift as weight) signaled early, tightens via child's "mountain is hungry" forcing release amid moons' alignment under Accumulative lens. Agency in opening jars forecloses keeping bugs, with visible cost in spared village and her emptiness. Moral calculus between holding and offering sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of release-as-transformation emerges from bug spiral and "forgotten it wasn't yours to keep," reweighting prior holdings without statement. Subtext in hush's "vibrating with unspoken things" invites ambiguity; final bug flicker offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity in accidental prophecy lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "texture of transformation" bias; diction/rhythm modulates from hushed observation to release's poise. Child's sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Light"), distinct idiom. No head-hopping; elision of ferry backstory anchors present without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lightning bugs rose in a spiral... gentled, to slow"); varied rhythm accelerates in release beat. Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful, pattern-taught in hush/lava motifs. Propulsion peaks in "one suspended moment."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic philanthropy and bug-lava offering transforms coincidence trope via grounded details like "twelve glass jars." Risk in volcano prophecy payoff heightens stakes organically; final missed bug flicker inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
