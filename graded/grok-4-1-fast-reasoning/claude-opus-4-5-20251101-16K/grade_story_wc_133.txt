<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal exchange reveals Mira's values hierarchy—sharing paradox over solitary painting—earned by insomnia-driven discovery and embodied exhaustion; trader's pressure forces micro-choice with relational cost. Contradictory impulses act in hoarse murmur to insect and terse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rain trails to brooch density buildup, trader ellipsis as pattern break; CR closure in dream reconfigures war symbols as shared truth with insomnia cost legible in "first time in years, she slept."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal shore constrains discovery and exchange timing via tides/causeway; kelp-draped stones, rivulets mirror internal convergence, charging final dream image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to thresh meaning tightens via brooch paradox deepening knowledge, exchange agency foreclosing solo art path; cost felt in relinquished painting, reweighting to shared revelation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Brooch's dual symbol and insect endurance emerge theme of forgotten convergence without statement; final vision non-literally answers conflict premise, reweighting wars via exchanged canvas peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water rhythms and haggard noticing; dialogue subtext-driven (trader's luck query evades war pain), voices distinct (Mira's hoarseness vs. trader's weathered smile), rhythm modulates to quiet closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from rivulet-tracing to weighted exchange; no loops, purposeful lyricism ("haggard awe") pattern-taught without muddle in peak handover beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water wars/tidal art frame transforms post-conflict trope via brooch paradox and trader neutral; convergence synthesis feels inevitable, risking quiet CR over confrontation.</comment>
