<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's interior contradiction between protocol and immersion yields embodied micro-choices like pressing the shaving, earning the closure acceptance of burden; childhood memory reveals particular flaws driving the prophecy without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from shaving extraction to merged memory/prophecy CR closure; "He had spoken prophecy" reconfigures options with universe-debt cost legible in final writing beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard atop tower constrains via rustling trees as witnesses charging final image; sensory hierarchy (wax translucence, salt-air apples) filters through Silas's archival priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to archive cleanly deepens via memory-prophecy merger under Accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance with burden-cost; agency in continuing transcription forecloses safe protocol path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of words shaping worlds emerges implicitly via orchard's memory and prophecy's debt; final "trees waited" offers resonant CR reweighting archival purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in dead-language conduits and velvet diction; rhythmic control heightens pressure in Sumerian prophecy beat without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "perfume to fabric" integrated into action; zero loops, varied syntax propels to charged closure image without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-archiving scribe in skyscraper orchard yields inevitable prophecy via memory merge; risk in Sumerian emergence transforms trope organically.</comment>
