<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's feather as "terrain of her loss" and "second heartbeat" roots motivation in embodied grief, earning the "something unknotted in Vera's chest" via micro-choices like following warmth. Internal conflict between visitor status and deeper rhythm plays out simultaneously in her work and wonder. Old man adds crucible without overshadowing; final endurance of vigil forecloses isolation with relational/emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds from descent to firefly chamber, tightening via geothermal vent's warmth into Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (descent at dusk into facility). CR lands on-page in feather-to-glow image reweighting grief, with conceptual cost of transformed loss legible in "even ash could become beautiful."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and dome's "black water" with sunken city constrain path to antechamber and charge final vigil image. Sensory hierarchy (astrologer's alignments via tidal vibrations) filters details purposefully. "Pocket of humid atmosphere" via vent evolves causally, mirroring internal pressure relief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging's rhythm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via firefly density break forcing endurance choice to stay. Agency in tracking vibrations/following warmth narrows from measurement to presence; cost felt in unknotted chest and feather's reweighting. One decisive deepening suffices, charging final image without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-wonder emerges via feather-firefly reprise, offering non-literal answer in "sorrow...transforms into wonder" without stating moral. Subtext in shared silence and old man's non-questions builds ambiguity around belonging as rhythm. Final image reweights premise organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in astrologer-noticing ("constellations through fathoms," tidal rhythms). Voice modulates rhythmically from descent's poise to fireflies' wonder. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I was the last caretaker"); no head-hopping, elision purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences in discovery: "And there—suspended like living punctuation—drifted fireflies"); high density with multi-job lines. Minor simile density ("honey through gauze," "frozen weather") coherent/voice-motivated, no loops or muddle touching closure. Propulsion aligns with accumulative builds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater astrologer premise synthesizes stars/grief/fireflies ingeniously, transforming abandoned-trope via geothermal fireflies and feather arc. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in hindsight; "first fireflies of summer" in abyss freshens without gimmick.</comment>
