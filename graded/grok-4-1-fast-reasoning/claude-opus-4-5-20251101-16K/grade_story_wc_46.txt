<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied emotion and micro-choices like weighing glass and polishing rhythms, rooted in trauma-motivated renunciation of fire; earned stasis in returning to work shows credible endurance with isolation cost. Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, just reflective layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from morning gatherings to starlit polishing; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "light reached out again... to anyone lost," reweighting loneliness with undeniable patience cost felt in final image of grotto breathing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's misted passages and workbench constrain choices (ledge placement, polishing wheel); sensory hierarchy (cool skin, salt residue) mirrors internal states purposefully. Final image charges with starlight crack enabling glow, environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, textural deepening in starlight striking blue glass narrows to successful endurance; agency in polishing/placement forecloses fire path with patience cost legible. Lacks one more pressure-tightening beat for 8.8+ under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of radiance in brokenness emerges organically from sea glass evolution and memory anchors, subtext in "glass simply remembered the light"; final image offers resonant answer via light-sharing without moralizing, reweighting isolation premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature star-watcher specific (light sleeping in stones); rhythm modulates from patient strokes to held-breath tension without drift or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose dense and propulsive with varied syntax ("mist curled... patient as grief"); no loops, purposeful metaphors consistent (skin remembers warmth), high read-aloud rhythm peaks in "glass drank the light. Held it. Began to glow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes loss/craft into starlight-capturing beacons, transforming lighthouse trope via sea glass physics; risk in lyric non-causal drive heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
