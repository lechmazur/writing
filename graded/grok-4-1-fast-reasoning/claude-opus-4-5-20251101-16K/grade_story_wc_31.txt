<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via key tag's tactile warmth and weeping into mask; contradictory patience/solitude vs. longing earned through purposeful wandering; final endurance to continue search forecloses closure with emotional cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to jars' shimmer ("water around him shimmered amber"), culminating in CR closure ("live inside the question") with legible cost in committed descent; orientation anchored para 1, one tightening via unseen shelves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library jars constrain discovery and charge epiphany; sensory amber shimmer and lantern ripples filter through Elias's synesthetic bias; pier lamps' final flicker ("flickered differently tonight") recharges image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled via Marina's vow; accumulative deepening at jar opening narrows to completion choice with agency (weeps, decides "He could complete it"); cost felt in renunciation of finality, charging lanterns' image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of searching as luminous vow emerges via jars' unfinished thesis mirroring Elias's arc; final key warming offers resonant non-literal answer ("Marina knew"), reweighting promise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature (sounds as colors); rhythmic modulation peaks in "breath-held moment"; purposeful lyric compression taught early via wandering, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short weep sentence amid lyric flow); no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density ("meteor hush" motif purposeful); propulsion clear to final "He had work to do."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia jars in drowned library transforms lamplighter solitude; risk in accumulative CR payoff feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, bold premise integration.</comment>
