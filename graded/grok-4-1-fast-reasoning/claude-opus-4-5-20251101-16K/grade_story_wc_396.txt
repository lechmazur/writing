<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vela's characterization shines through embodied shadows pulsing and holding contradictory truths, earning her loneliness as felt cost in the final preparation beat. Sera's reactions add crucible pressure without overshadowing. Contradictory impulses in seeing all perspectives compel her closure stance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via glimpse density building to RR (Charged Poise) in Vela's translation of loss to direction, with cost legible in her embraced shadows and waiting. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse orchard. Single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vintage mirrors and frost-heavy apple trees constrain visions and charge final image of defiant fragrance amid shifting ice. Sensory details (salt-tinged cold, groaning floes) filter through Vela's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (mirrors) pivotal to method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening glimpses narrowing to forgiveness message, forcing Sera's purpose shift. Vela's agency in intuitive non-grasping drives turn; cost felt in paternal shame revelation and Vela's loneliness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reconstituting hidden meanings emerges organically from mirror-constellation and crystal truth made whole, resonating in final orchard defiance without moralizing. Subtext in unspoken loves and swallowed pain invites ambiguity on generational poison. Closing image reweights loss-to-direction non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Vela's perceptual signature (shadow-laced intuition, mirror glimpses); voice modulates rhythmically with vision density. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("How could she?"), distinguishing Sera's raw doubt from Vela's calm. No head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "glimpses came slowly... let them find their order"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Vivid specifics replace generics; final line recharges orchard motif crisply. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy-mapping via mirrors in improbable ice orchard transforms peacekeeper trope into anomaly with lived loneliness cost. Risky setting (trees on ice) heightens defiance theme organically. No derivative echoes; premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
