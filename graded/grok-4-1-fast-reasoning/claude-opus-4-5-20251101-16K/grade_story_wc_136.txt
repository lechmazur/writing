<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trembling certainty" and fingers that tremble yet certainty holds, compelling the punch press with earned emotional cost tied to buried family confessions. Micro-choices like following cracks reveal map-maker values under pressure. Final voice-speaking renunciation forecloses silence with visible tears-freezing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crack patterns density-build to gate slot, punch impression yields CR closure when pressed, reweighting life routes with undeniable personal cost in "tears freezing on her cheeks." Orientation anchors by para 2; one tightening via dissolving architecture narrows to entrance. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Starlit vault and mist recur to constrain path (thickens yet brightens, guiding deeper) and charge final image as "ancient and patient" witnesses. Cracks as tactile setting evolve causally, mirroring internal unsaid. Sensory hierarchy (visual mist/auditory hum) filters through analytical POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unsaid truths) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via arrow cracks forcing path commitment, culminating in punch agency that crystallizes stance with on-page cost (interrupted conversation completed amid frozen tears). Pressure coheres sans reversal overload; live option of return foreclosed. Moral calculus in daring personal exposure sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid words emerges via crystallized whispers/walls, reweighted in final RR where Elara speaks father's name aloud, answered by fortress—non-literal answer to central question sans moralizing. Particulars (punch inheritance, crack arrows) yield resonance; ambiguity lingers in open gate for next seeker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-limited perceptual signature (routes as patterns, "analytically artistic") biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens pressure in short, propulsive sentences at punch press. Voice modulates lyric density without drift; no elision or head-hopping. Prose as character reflects map-maker precision in mist contradictions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cracks led her through empty plazas" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Figurative integration purposeful (towers of "crystallized whispers") without muddle in peak gate beat. Propulsion matches escalation, zero scaffold in closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: route mapper navigates pavement arrows to unsaid fortress, transforming trope via punch inheritance and mist vault logic. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick; final open gate reconfigures premise organically.</comment>
