<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied curiosity via log cross-referencing and vector sketches driving micro-choices like splinting the pigeon; minor slip in label-speak ("credibly curious") slightly undercuts interior contradiction during intuition beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density from message to logs to intuition tightening knowledge; closure as Charged Poise in journal encoding with cost of solitary verification legible in "integrity demanding she verify alone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard workbench and olive tree constrain analysis and release choice, charging final bastion image; sensory dusk progression (bruised sky to stars) mirrors internal reweighting without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anomaly verification escalates via lateral intuition narrowing options (bait realization forces solo path); cost felt in pigeon release foreclosing immediate evac/report.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of oblique truths in storms emerges organically from log vectors and bait reweighting; final "solitude nurtured, integrity bloomed" resonates without moralizing, though minor counter-reading ambiguity in pigeon "truce."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with meteorological perceptual signature (vortices, theodolite lens); rhythmic modulation peaks in intuition without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in observation beats with varied rhythm; minor patterned repetition ("layered tranquility," "quiet courtyard") in final third nudges below 8.5 but closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-weaponized pigeons and lateral storm intuition transforms quarantine trope; risk in poetic speculative tone heightens courtyard stakes without gimmick.</comment>
