<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied contradiction in "wept silently for the dead, even as logic cataloged the entries," earning final heritage wholeness; trait shown through micro-choices blending sorrow and publication resolve. Repeated "emotionally rational" label slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density (letter→microscript→ledgers) tightening to CR closure: "truth rescued from lies' noble shroud" with grandfather's cost legible in final emergence under stars. Orientation anchored immediately; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy constrains entry ("pushing through the ivy curtain") and mirrors lies in closure ("ivy whispering surrender"); bare rosebush charges final image as "season of pretense ended." Sensory selection purposeful, POV-filtered by historian's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, deepens via decoding gas revelation narrowing options to deeper tunnel venture; agency in "pry[ing] open a rusted locker" with emotional cost felt on-page. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from letter/ledgers/particulars, resonant non-literal answer in "noble lies as ivy, beautiful but suffocating" reweighting premise without moralizing. Parallels motif accumulates without token force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in historian's detail-noticing (microscript technique); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively. Minor register elevation in repeated diagnostic phrasing ("emotionally rational") fits but converges slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "drawing parallels" (four instances) and "emotionally rational" (repeated verbatim) create template cadence in final third, dulling closure propulsion (−1.1); high density elsewhere, rhythm varies. Minor synonym churn on "pit of lies."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of WWI microscript forgery, gas atrocity, and modern parallels transforms noble-lie trope via personal grandfather tie; risk in accumulative discoveries heightens stakes organically.</comment>
