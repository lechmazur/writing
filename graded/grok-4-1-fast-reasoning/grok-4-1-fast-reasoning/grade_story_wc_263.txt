<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resistance to rest—"fearing the creativity's escape in idleness"—reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene, with embodied ache earning final surrender and visible cost of eternal cycle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tracing density builds to CR closure—"Stardust awoke, remembered, unbound"—repricing premise with conceptual cost of unending cycle; orientation anchored early in archway vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astrolabe and ice pedestal as micro-setting constrain tracing choices; archway's final brighter pulse charges ending image under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing creativity tightens accumulatively through whisper-deepening that narrows to rest; exhaustion cost legible in "body ached, yet she pressed on."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic origins emerges via stardust visions, final image of erupting ideas yet eternal archway call offers resonant reconfiguration without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with cosmic perceptual signature ("silent symphonies... radio waves") stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation fits moonstruck intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density peaks overwrought in tracing beats ("silver vein" stacks with "arcs etch patterns"); "unspoken words" repetition (4x) creates paraphrase loop dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cosmic creativity block resolved via meteor-tracing surrender offers fresh, non-obvious synthesis; transforms dreamer trope through specific auroral mechanics.</comment>
