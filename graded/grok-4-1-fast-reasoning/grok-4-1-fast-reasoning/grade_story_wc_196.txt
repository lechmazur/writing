<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's grief embodied in "broken heart a fresh wound" and "eyes misted" drives micro-choices like prying the box; final purpose renewal earned via discovery without tidy epiphany. Minor slip: backstory summary slightly abstracts initial motivation before cueing present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns → pry → compartment → letter builds density to CR closure in "purpose renewed" with scarred heart cost legible in final polish image. Orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity or shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust motes, mildew, grimy windows constrain choice via "peculiar patterns" on box, charging discovery; tactile integration like "gloved finger" mirrors archivist bias. 9+ gate met: setting shapes pivotal pry and final tuck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover kindness amid grief) signaled early, tightens via compartment find narrowing despair options; cost felt in "spirit lifted" yet "scarred" heart. Agency in patient scrutiny coherent under accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of kindness amplification emerges via letter's "small kindnesses woven," resonant CR in button polish reweighting grief without moralizing. Final image answers "coaxing light from shadows" non-literally; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: archivist notices "faint outlines like ghostly fingerprints." Rhythmic control in varying syntax heightens dust scrutiny; no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, e.g., "pried gently... soft crack" advances cleanly; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor artifact: "tactfully hopeful" thrice creates slight loop, but motif-taught; no closure touch or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-emancipation archive dust revealing interracial foster bond transforms discovery trope. Risk in quiet CR heightens emotional stakes; button/letter particulars irreplaceable.</comment>
