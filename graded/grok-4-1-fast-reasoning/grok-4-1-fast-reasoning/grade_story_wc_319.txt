<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Feral guardian's contradictory impulses—feral growl warring with lucid resolve—act simultaneously, compelling the earned lunge at the cultist ghost that merges knowledge and opens the portal with homesick cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as interiorizing density builds from garden chill to mist apparitions, yielding Charged Poise closure when "portal yawned amid the thorns" with felt reshaping cost; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
