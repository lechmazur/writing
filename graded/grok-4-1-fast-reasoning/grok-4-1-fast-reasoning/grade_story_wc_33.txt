<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in bride's loss drives micro-choices like deferential patrol smile masking drone launch; contradictory impulses (respect vs. rebellion) act simultaneously; final letter earns path-foreclosing endurance with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (density of linked absences) holds to CR closure in letter's coordinates reweighting drone network's reach; orientation anchored early (Elias at arcade border); no lens ambiguity, cost legible in "heart heavier with ghosts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt booth constrains drone vent-launch and patrol tap; twilight hush mirrors internal hush-thickening tension; recurring vial glow and mailboxes charge final glance-back image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (foster escapes) signaled early, tightens via patrol check narrowing options; siren deepens under lens; agency in drone fueling/launching drives escalation to letter's payoff with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending borders' broken vows emerges via drone-chained absences; final vial "thunder rumbled... unbound" reconfigures premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity in letter's script lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (mapping voids); poetic diction/rhythm modulates from hush to rumble; dialogue subtextual ("fine evening," manifest handoff) advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration into propulsion (vial "cradling thunderstorm"); minor metaphor density in opening risks overwrite but patterns purposefully; no loops, rhythm varies with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman-drone smuggling transforms border trope; vial-drone absences chain organically; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
