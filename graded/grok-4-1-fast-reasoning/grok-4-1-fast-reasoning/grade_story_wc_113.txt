<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in dreams and family legacy drives consistent micro-choices like tracing symbols and slashing the lantern, earning the shift from "lately inspired" to "ignited." Interiority embodied via trembling bow and racing heart, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, muting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oriented quickly in orchestra pit of flooded opera house; causal chain of program discovery → water coaxing → lantern slash → grate pry delivers Charged Poise closure with Elias clutching score amid collapsing house, legible cost in alarms and groaning structure. Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid holds, tightening via disruptions narrowing revelation options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded pit muck and bobbing lanterns constrain choices, with water enabling image revelation and grate access; recurring lanterns topple in chain reaction charging climax chaos. Sensory hierarchy musical via "unstruck chords" and "water's lap," filtered through Elias's pit expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher code signaled early, escalates via agency-driven disruptions (dripping fingers, slashed lantern) foreclosing dry stasis for flood risk, culminating in score gain with house-cracking cost under Hybrid lens. One tightening suffices, visibly reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of bridging in-between spaces via disruption emerges organically from water-born symbols and final aria promise, resonant non-literal answer in "orchestra pit of his soul" reweighting silence-to-song without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in musical biases ("unstruck chords," bow's arc); poetic compression of motifs like "flicker" taught early, modulating rhythm under rising chaos without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence ("in-between spaces," lanterns), but minor paraphrase loops in repeated "images bloomed vividly" and "lantern light dancing" dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies, strong verbs propel to "aria soared."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water damage as code-revealer in musician's haunted pit transforms ghost trope via tactile disruption mechanics, inevitable in hindsight from program glint to score payoff.</comment>
