<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in loss intensifies through micro-choices like mirror placement and breathing sync; embodied emotions via breath fogging glass. Internal conflict subtle in grounded refusal vs dream pursuit, but epiphanies lean toward stock reconciliation at embrace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrors build labyrinth → sextant anchors → breathing dissolves veil to RR closure with orchard's wholeness as reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early; cost legible in fog's retreat and years' loss recaptured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass mountains from mirrors constrain tactics and charge final sentinel image; sensory fog, rot, frost evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw. POV filter sharpens via mirror-maker's light/refractive bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture dream) signaled early, tightens via breathing sync narrowing boundaries under accumulative lens. Agency in recreating intimacy forecloses illusion path with felt cost of prior vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of boundary dissolution emerges organically via mirrors/breathing, reweighted in final embrace without moralizing. Resonant image of whole orchard answers loss/recovery question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in reflective diction; rhythm modulates from setup to sync breaths. Poetic texture purposeful, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (glass mountains). Minor density overload in peak sync beat slightly blurs rhythm but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors/sextant/breathing transforms dream-capture trope; surreal orchard fog feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky surrealism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
