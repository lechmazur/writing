<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in past-life memory and sparks, compelling the healing choice with embodied curiosity; Mira applies secondary pressure as quest link. Final realization earns change via prior causality, foreclosing distant-vault seeking. Minor weakness: Mira's traits shown lightly, lacking distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sparks/memory to projection/breathing, culminating in CR closure ("unused love...in these connections") with conceptual cost of reweighted quest. Orientation anchors early (viaduct, twilight). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (fog, wisteria glow, foggy breaths) filters through Elias's spark-perception; obscura/tear as micro-settings constrain healing choice and charge final blooming shimmer. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's wound/sparks, forcing synchronized breathing agency; knot dissolution narrows options with felt release cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love's storage in connections emerges organically via healing particulars, reweighted in final realization without statement; resonant image (merged sparks into flame) answers quest non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (spark-seeing, spiritual curiosity bias); voice texture poetic/mystical, modulates rhythm in peak breathing sync. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I see the lights too").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; "foggy lucidity" repeats purposefully for tone but borders loop (-0.4). Minor scaffold in breathing descriptions; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obscura-healing, sparks pilgrimage, breath-release transforms mystical tropes; risk in abstract "unused love" paid via concrete projection ties to inevitable CR.</comment>
