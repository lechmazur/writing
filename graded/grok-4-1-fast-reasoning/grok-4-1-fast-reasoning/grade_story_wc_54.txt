<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through steady competence rooted in her engineering traits, driving micro-choices like splicing lines. Interiority is concrete and embodied in tactile actions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no visible internal hesitation mars her stoic efficiency. Final endurance of decay reversal feels earned with felt effort cost; no real flaws complicate peak choices. Single-POV voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via exploration density and holds: flows redirect accumulatively to resonator awakening as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of quantified hope. Single continuous scene anchors who/where/when by para 1, no orientation debt. Closure lands on-page ("holograms blooming... Awaiting intentions") with undeniable reconfiguration of maze possibilities. One tightening via sextant alignment narrows options elegantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "cracked ferrocrete," "stress fractures," and "vents hissing" constrain choices (e.g., prying panels, routing pipes through maze conduits), charging final holo image. Sensory hierarchy filters through engineer's priorities (structural decay, flows). Atmosphere of stoic decay mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent in tightening maze convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect terminal via engineering hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through flow redirections that deepen pressure and narrow options with visible costs (sparks, rust flakes). Agency in her tactical choices (splicing, uncapping) drives one meaningful tightening at sextant click. Cost legible in steady hand under stoic focus, charging final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope via redirected intentions emerges organically from particulars like sextant alignment and flow rerouting, reweighting decay premise in final holo paths without moralizing. Subtext in maze as frozen purposes yields resonant CR: "equations for hope etched in her mind." Protagonist arc inextricable from theme; ambiguity lingers in open trajectories. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (engineering lens on fractures, flows); diction/rhythm modulates from exploratory breath to humming crescendo. Prose texture distinct in celestial-engineering fusion ("arc etched with celestial calibrations"). Resonator's single line natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; distance tightens at climax without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sextant piece fit perfectly... Click" advances plot/action/image), but minor paraphrase loops ("stoic wonder," "equations for hope") and repetitive phrasing ("flows") drag rhythm slightly. Read-aloud ear strong with varied syntax; no heavy artifacts obscure closure. Figuratives coherent, no muddle in peak. Strategic telling efficient for background.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering in sci-fi decay: sextant-flow resurrection transforms abandoned trope into "maze of intentions" ingenuity. Risky stoic tone heightens stakes without gimmick; final image inevitable from prior particulars. No derivative templates; premise commits to fractal equations without retreat.</comment>
