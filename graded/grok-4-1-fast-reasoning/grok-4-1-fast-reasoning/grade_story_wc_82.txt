<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in grief's "radiant agony" driving ascent amid emotional plummet; final folding rite earned via prior causality with poured essence as cost. Interiority concrete and particular through crafty adaptations of lanterns to dream-quartz. No safety-hedging flaws; competence balanced by torment's tremble in fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shadow-detach haze to basilica projection, culminating in RR (cranes scatter torment) with legible emotional cost in tears/essence. Orientation anchored early (Elar post-detach on isle). Single-shard progression with purposeful causality in gem-to-dream-to-fold chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating isle, staircase paradox, and basilica constrain choices (updrafts lift amid descent drag; glass amplifies projection). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gems pulse like heartbeats; camellias weep dew mirroring grief). Environment charges final image: glass vents release cranes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief) signaled early, escalates via density increase: polishing visions → lucid recording → basilica warp, narrowing to fold-or-yield under lens. Agency in crafty precision forecloses raw torment with visible tear-cost. One tightening suffices, coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-fragile-peace emerges organically via shadow/grief/crane particulars, reweighted in final wheeling image without moral. Subtext in luminous paradox tensions release; no tidy binaries, ambiguity in "reborn amid folded echoes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: all through glow/haze (e.g., "steam curled... petals aglow"). Rhythmic control modulates from torment density to release cadence; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at crane burst.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., polishing hums visions while advancing rite); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak polish/projection beats purposeful for lyric tone, no muddle/coherence loss. No loops/scaffold; "luminous torment" recurrence pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shadow-detach grief recorded via lantern-gems, paradox-folded into cranes on levitating isle transforms loss tropes organically. Risky fantasy logic (dream-quartz whetstones) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via Lira-echoes. Bold voice commits fully without retreat.</comment>
