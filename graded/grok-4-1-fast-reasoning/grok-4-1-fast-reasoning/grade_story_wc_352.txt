<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait consistently drives refraction of histories and visions, compelling the leap into the threshold; embodied latent blaze sharpens focus amid inversion chaos. Interiority concrete via spectral facets and pulsing doodle. Minor abstraction in "seeds of vigilance" blooming avoids higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist, spirals, and inversion builds to on-page CR closure where memorized patterns reconfigure Elara's soul with felt cost of fleeting hour ("As the hour waned"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine paths and mist constrain navigation and reveal threshold ripple; inversion lifts pebbles, swirling mist upward, charging inversion chamber's crystals. Prismatic POV filters gleam and pulse vividly. Final mist lingering mirrors enduring vigilance, recharging opener.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find combinations) tightens via inversion hour's pressure, forcing leap agency; revelation deepens knowledge with cost of prior failed entry implied in reenter drive. Accumulative escalation via spectral build to prism touch; cost legible in waning gravity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vigilance refracting hidden truths emerges organically via doodle seeds blooming into archon visions; final "prismatic soul" image offers non-literal resonance on concealment's price. No moralizing; ambiguity in cosmic unraveling lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with prismatic perceptual signature (histories into spectral facets); rhythmic lyricism modulates from quiet inferno to beacon blaze under inversion stress. No head-hopping or elision; voice purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion (mist coiling like thoughts) with varied rhythm; purposeful motif recurrence (spirals, blaze) taught early avoids loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("waves distorting air") during threshold leap dings peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prismatic archival fantasy with gravity inversion and alchemical combinations; risk-taking in lyric accumulation transforms grotto tropes via reenter climax grounded in doodle pattern.</comment>
