<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in pride-silence regret intensifies compellingly to evoke visions; contradictory tenderness-fierceness embodied in tears mixing with mist at first clearing. Internal conflict acts simultaneously via pressing on despite fractured vision. Minor label repetition ("fierce tenderness") slightly abstracts peak embodiment without touching closure embrace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via song density and shard pulses building to Thorne's limbo pull; orientation anchored early in labyrinth intro. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (reclaimed bond) lands decisively in root-throne embrace with felt cost of healed regret legible in "wounds sealed forever." No slips; persistent shard constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove specifics (twisted roots, glass-leaves as windows, spirit-thorn lash) constrain via gash and shifting paths, charging final root-throne image. Sensory hierarchy (hymns tugging regrets, moonlight veins) reflects Elara's longing bias. Environment mirrors internal frayed bonds purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke pre-decision moment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fractured pool vision narrowing options before root-throne deepening. Agency in repeated evoking forces trade-off (weeping amplifies but risks fracture); cost legible in hollowed spirit mending. Minor abstractness in "what-ifs limbo" slightly softens visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed unspoken apology emerges organically via unsent letters etched in mist, shifting from fractured vision to resonant reunion without moralizing. Final image (hand-in-hand emergence) non-literally reweights silence's cost. Counter-reading (pride's persistence) adds ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (ethereal hymns as regrets, shard as captured storm) stable in third-limited POV; rhythm modulates from humming air to crescendo song. Minimal dialogue ("I waited") natural, subtext-laden goal pursuit. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with incantation swells, but "fierce tenderness" motif loops 4x verge on paraphrase churn in high-pressure evoking beats (−0.4). Figurative density coherent (vines claiming shores) without muddle. Propulsion strong to dawn lullaby; minor scaffold in repeated "unsent letters" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove spirits' hymns and condensation messages transforms apology trope via limbo-pull logic. Risky lyric fantasy risks purple but heightens stakes coherently (+0.3). Core premise (moonlight shard evoking what-ifs) inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
