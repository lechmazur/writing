<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust drives embodied choices like tempered breaths and sequential vows, revealing contradictory impulses (exuberance vs. caution) that earn the final trust reconfiguration. Thorne applies relational pressure via doubt, forcing micro-choices. Minor label-speak in repeated "cautious exuberance" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vow inscriptions build density, unsnarling glyphs in rising cadence to RR closure (trust reborn, ink talisman) with felt risk cost legible in "one errant glyph could unravel them both." Orientation anchored early in vault; single scene coherent. Persistent ink constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's hush and spectral murmurs constrain choices (wary of wraiths), glass ink well as micro-setting charges final image (pocketed droplet). Sensory hierarchy (hum, chime, vibrations) filters via Elara's priorities. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, tightens via accumulative deepening: visions from unsnarls reweight knowledge, forcing stance crystallization with agency in chained vows. Cost visible in revealed fears and curse risk. Climax crescendo charges final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of enduring bonds via linguistic truth emerges organically from symphonies revealing histories, final ink talisman offering non-literal resonant answer (paths diverge but not divide). Subtext in silence bridged by vows avoids moralizing. Particulars like bramble glyphs shift meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (glyphs as brambles, ink alive); poetic diction/rhythm ("shadows clung to shelves like forgotten syllables") modulates with pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Not risk... restore"), advances plot. Distinct voices; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short crescendo sentences), high density integrates action/imagery. Minor artifacts: repeated "cautious exuberance" and "carefully reckless" phrasing borders template cadence in opening beats (−0.5), but no closure touch or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Vorathil unsnarling via vows transforms pact-weaver tropes into relational magic, with ink well's symphonies inevitable from setup. Risky poetic fantasy voice heightens stakes organically.</comment>
