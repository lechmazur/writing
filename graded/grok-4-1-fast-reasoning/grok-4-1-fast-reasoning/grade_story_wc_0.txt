<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in neutron star philosophy drives concrete micro-choices like dusting leaves and data, earning her humbled change with felt cost in ambition stripped; interiority concrete via waveform analogies. Minor slips in over-articulated epiphanies like "truth emerges in patience" don't undermine pivotal spectrometer success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from leaf to mirrors to data tightening stake; on-page CR closure via publication and "decay a kindled humility etched in her soul" shows legible conceptual cost in foreclosed dramatic quests.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse vividly anchors sensory specifics like "muddied remnants" and "humid light," constraining choices via debris-rigged spectrometer; final "vines decayed to skeletal frames, yet bloomed tiny new shoots" charges closure image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revive research via dust stripping drama signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening experiments narrowing options to humility; cost visible in "wingless now, but alive" butterflies and refined data's simplicity at spectrometer peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of gradual decay stripping excess emerges organically from dust trials paralleling pulsars, resonant in final greenhouse rebirth without moralizing; whisper "No more theatrics" mid-story echoes but doesn't replace scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fractal/pulsar filters; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, purposeful poetic diction taught early legible at closure despite minor elevated register in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops like "preprocesses reality" (4x) and "decay" variants create patterned artifacts dulling density in reflective beats; paraphrase redundancy in "gradual change orchestrated through accumulated dust patterns" paraphrase near spectrometer, but rhythm varies overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly dust as pulsar preprocessor in ravaged greenhouse transforms tropes organically; risk-taking lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
