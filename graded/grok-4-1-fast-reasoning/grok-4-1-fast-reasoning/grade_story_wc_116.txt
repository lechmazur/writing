<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment compels the burrow decisively, rooted in loose grip trait that enables ethereal agency. Interiority particular through mythic perception, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal burrow beat. Earned immersion shows meaningful change with felt cost of slackened reality grip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from swan unfolding to refuge immersion, culminating in CR ("eternity's truest ledger") with legible conceptual cost of further slackened grip. Orientation anchored early in library catacombs. One tightening via memorized folds guiding burrow narrows to deeper vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent fungi, river lullaby) reflects POV's serene urgency; obsidian refuge as micro-setting constrains arrival and charges final image of self-healing pages. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal erosion to regeneration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deeper unjudging vigil via regenerative silence) signaled early, tightens texturally through burrow's reality compression with agency in following folds. Cost legible in "body compressing reality's edges" altering to renewed state. Quiet pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle erosion to regenerated observation emerges organically from particulars like yielding soil and self-healing pages. Final image ("swan... awaited another seeker") offers resonant CR reweighting change as eternal bridge, with conceptual cost of endless watch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical texture (e.g., "fingers tracing words... as whispers adrift"); perceptual signature biases toward mythic geometry and decay. Rhythmic modulation heightens burrow meditation; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in burrow beat ("helix born of paper's geometry," "soil parting like obedient pages") risks coherence without pattern payoff, docking for overwriting. Minor paraphrase loops ("drift of untold seasons" twice). Rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami geometry as burrowing method transforms fantasy tropes into inevitable path to regenerative core. Risky lyric drift heightens stakes of loose reality without gimmick; final swan reprise feels organic and non-obvious.</comment>
