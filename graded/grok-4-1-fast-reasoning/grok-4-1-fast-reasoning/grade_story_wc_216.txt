<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in Lira's loss intensifies compellingly to the chest-pressing beat; interiority concrete in heart syncing and visions. Minor weakness: internal conflict leans toward summary rather than simultaneous impulses acting in the capsule-prying moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("time's texture was loss made eternal"); cost legible in eternalized grief. Orientation anchored early in silo/Shift; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald silo setting constrains choices (hiding from enforcers, descent to undercroft) and charges final broadcast image; sensory details (verdant glows, veined walls) selective via POV. Recurring fungal sheen mirrors internal warp without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture understanding) signaled early, tightens texturally at fragment touch narrowing options to visions; agency in descent/pry/press forecloses numbness with felt loss cost. Coherent pressure culminates in reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time as textured loss emerges organically from urn fragment and visions; resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("etch into his bones—coarse, yearning, alive") answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (chronal vapors warping air) stable in close third; rhythm modulates intensity. Minor register elevation in peak visions feels slightly mismatched to stressed horologist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful compression; high density advances texture. Weakness: figurative overload in climax visions ("silken drags... gritty rasps... plush weight") triggers coherence dip without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh Shift premise (numbers echo, garage sales underground) synthesizes ingeniously into textured time-weaving; garage listing reprise transforms tropes organically.</comment>
