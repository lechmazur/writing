<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mapkeeper's motivation rooted in guardianship traits compels precise micro-choices like tracing cracks; embodied repose (breath forging resolve) shows contradiction between outer din and inner calm. Interiority particular via ripple readings. Minor slip: poetic "hammered repose" borders formulaic but ties to change at bloom's swell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripple-crack patterns densify to cadence shift at bloom unfolding. Orientation anchored early (caves, beings, descent). Closure as RR (hush petals muting roar) with conceptual cost (ongoing vigil) legible in "she carried the quiet within, ready for the next fracture."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost-veined ice, crack veins as maps constrain conjuring choice and charge mandala image. Sensory hierarchy: narrowed to tactile fissures amid din. POV bias: Mapkeeper notices ripple echoes, evolving causally to luminous hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim harmony) signaled early; tightening via spiral node discovery narrows to epicenter positioning under accumulative lens. Agency in conjuring forecloses chaos path with recoil cost felt in tendrils snuffed. Charges final poised vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of enduring quiet emerges from fracture readings to hush petals; subtext in recoiling energies implies fragile balance. Resonant CR in restored mandalas reweights invasion premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: ripple webs, silt steps bias noticing. Voice texture modulates rhythmically from hammered din to stilled thrum; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density propels but "hammered repose"/"ripple" loops (4+ repeats) and synonym churn (luminous/glow/ember) create paraphrase drag across bloom beat. Dense metaphors coherent yet overwrite climax fissures pulsing. Rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ice cracks as ripple maps conjuring hush bloom transforms invasion trope; risk in lyric pattern heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight from silt steps to mandala closure.</comment>
