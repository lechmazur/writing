<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elowen's sentimentality embodied in "quiet ache for lineages lost" and contradictory drive to warn softly despite progenitors' fate compels the embedding choice. Final retreat with "eased yet forever haunted" heart shows earned endurance with cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via gear's "screaming eternal loops" vs. subtle embedding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pings and gear visions to throne embedding as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting patterns with choice's light. Orientation anchored early in nebula garden. Closure cost legible in "patterns might yet loop, but her light...offered the first true fracture."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden's thickening veils demand sonar, constraining transit; petal-throne and gear veins charge final image of fledgling's widened eyes. Sensory hierarchy via pings' "echoes laden with data" reflects Elowen's priorities. Petals' sigh evolves causally, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share patterns softly) signaled early, tightens via gear's projections forcing subtle embedding over blaze. Accumulative escalation in intensifying pings and visions narrows to renunciation of direct truth. Cost felt in haunted vigil, but lacks sharper trade-off in peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cycles fractured by gentle light emerges from weavers' vision to fledgling's "bridges of tempered ambition." Final image reweights premise without moral: "gear spun on, whispering infinities tamed." Emergent from particulars, invites ambiguity on rupture's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in echoed patterns and sentimental bias. Lyrical rhythm modulates: short pings build to flowing closure. Purposeful repetition taught early pays off legibly under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; motif repeats ("petals sigh") patterned and propulsive. Minor paraphrase loops in final "quiet sigh" cluster dull closure image slightly (−0.5). Rhythmic variety supports lyric propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic cycles with gear's infinity and sonar in nebula garden transforms trope via sentimental calculus. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at fledgling's divergence.</comment>
