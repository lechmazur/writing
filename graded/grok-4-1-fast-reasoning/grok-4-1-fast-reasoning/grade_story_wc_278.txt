<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in guilt compels self-tattoo climax, embodied in bare arms now marked; internal conflict between past arrogance and present action feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dissonance density builds to Charged Poise RR ("Tether complete... cries softened"); time folds taught early pay off legibly with felt cost of bound guilt on skin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab's sonic relics and oak desk constrain choices (amber slotted, kit warped into reach); amber charges final image as empty relic, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush guilt signaled early, escalates via voice emergence and cry chorus under textural lens; agency in etching forecloses dissonance with legible skin-binding cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cry-translation/redemption emerges from ink-stars and firmware events; final cooing lullaby reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct sonic perceptual signature ("ghost of wings straining"); stable single POV modulates rhythmically with pressure, pattern-taught elisions legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density integrates motif repetition ("hush") purposefully; minor figurative density in opening ("time folded... ripples") purposeful without muddling peak tether beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist guilt tethered via haunted firmware/amber hum transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in time-fold structure heightens stakes inevitably to hush closure.</comment>
