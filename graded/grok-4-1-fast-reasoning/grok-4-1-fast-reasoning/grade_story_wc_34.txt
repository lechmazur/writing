<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs mirrors the ghost's and drives micro-choices like mixing resin with moss; interiority concrete in sensing whispers and chills. Contradictory impulses surface in her persistence against villagers' dismissal, earning the release. Final ballad formation shows earned change with cost in prior isolation echoed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to graffiti decoding to mural pulsing alive, delivering RR closure with cost in ghost's dissolution into "radiant code-streams." Orientation anchored early in courtyard; no shards or ambiguity. "The plate's bolts clicked final alignment" seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty fog supplies ochre pigments and rubble relic, constraining encoding tactics; graffiti walls evolve from static to shifting spectral face to pulsing mural, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (hum, chill, swirl) reflects Elowen's attuned perception. Courtyard's vaporous float subtly mirrors unspoken drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate needs, free ghost) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via relic discovery and alignment under timeframe pressure, narrowing to encode-or-fail. Agency in positioning plate forces trade-off; cost legible in merging lines brightening. Release forecloses binding with visible surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of voicing unspoken needs emerges via graffiti pleas to thunderous harmony, reweighting initial silence in final "applause from the heavens" without moralizing. Returning vines/thorns shift from cryptic to blooming truths. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "whispers no one else caught"; voice poetic yet biased toward balladry, modulating rhythm in song: "Between flash and boom." Ghost's "rasped without sound" fits non-dialogue. No elision or head-hopping; diction consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short storm sentences to lilting song); high density in "twisting it like a tinker's dial to overlay" advances action/atmos. Motif repeats ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") taught early as pattern, no loops dulling closure. Minor figurative density pays off in pulsing mural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Victorian relic unlocks digital ghost in cloud graffiti, transforming scribe trope via tinkersong encoding. Risky ethereal logic commits fully, heightening stakes in storm pause. Final plate reprise inevitable from particulars.</comment>
