<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to teach silence drives consistent actions like vial monitoring, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws complicating choices; children read as stock noisy kids without distinct voices or pressure on Elias. Mira's weariness embodies transit fatigue effectively. Final pride feels earned but untested by genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: noise patterns build via crystals, catalyzed into hush for RR closure (vial clear, silence wiser) with emotional cost in chaos transmutation. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in terrace post-whistle. One tightening via foam absorption narrows to peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism facets and vial constrain choices (noise spikes crystals, gondola drift limits intervention) and charge final image (vial serene filigree). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Elias notices chimes over visuals. Atmosphere tensions noise against hush purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comfort via silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as crystals dance then dissolve, forcing Elias's catalytic agency with cost in softening chaos. Children's giggles test commitment, resolved by foam without coincidence. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence transmuting noise emerges via vial's reaction and passenger shift, resonant in final "silence wiser" without statement. Subtext in softened voices invites ambiguity on control vs. teaching. No moralizing; Mira's tears recharge prior pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias with perceptual signature (hush calculations, crystal symphonies). Voice rhythmic, modulating poetic hush under intervention pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: "Silence isn't empty" pursues goal. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Figurative density high ("veins of predicted turmoil") borders overwriting in opening but purposeful for tone; minor paraphrase loops ("vaulting hush" recurs without escalation). Propulsion strong in catalytic beat. Rhythms vary, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm glass as noise absorber in prism transit transforms silence trope into tactical tool. Vial's evolution feels inevitable from setup. Risky poetic sci-fi coheres without gimmick.</comment>
