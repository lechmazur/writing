<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope roots in consistent vigilance, shown through embodied ache ("heart ached") and micro-choices like drawing the stone; contradictory impulses peak in her resolve amid regret, earning the sacrificial metamorphosis. Internal conflict acts in scene via observation-to-action progression. Flawless under single-POV defaults; final endurance forecloses human warmth with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dusk/light patterns builds to shadow discovery and stone ritual, yielding Charged Poise closure in Elara's transformation ("form began to shift"), with legible cost in cracked stone and luminous regret. Orientation anchors early ("blooming library above the clouds"); single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (light softening "gold into lavender," orbs pulsing) filters through Elara's dusk bias, constraining choice at orb nexus where stone is placed. Recurring river stone charges final image ("cracked but victorious"). Purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism; 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope vs. shadow unbound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via comparison footage tightening to ritual, narrowing options to personal metamorphosis with agency-driven cost ("mourned the human warmth... forever altered"). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one decisive deepening suffices. Cost unmistakable in final patrols tinged with regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope's preservation at cost of wild potential emerges organically from fraying auras to leashed shadows, resonant in final image ("hope bloomed unbound no more... regret glowed softly"). Non-literal answer reweights sharing's dilution without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable. Counter-reading (shadow's promise) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (dusk shifts, orb petals); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, compressing at climax ("library trembled"). Purposeful elision of mechanics taught early via vigilance pattern, legible at closure. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, but minor paraphrase loops ("softly deliberate," "luminous regret") echo across beats (−0.3); purposeful pattern minimizes drag. No artifacts dull closure image; syntax propels to stone's glow. Read-aloud ear strong despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, cloud library, and primal stone transforms reverie-trope into specific moral calculus on diluted hope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via metamorphosis payoff. Inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
