<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to navigate loss feels rooted in embodied scars and micro-choices like scavenging driftwood, with tears at climax showing contradictory grief/resolution. Internal conflict emerges in "raw solace amid grief's vast terrain," avoiding tidy epiphanies. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak building drive without full present tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting density of moon-synced calls and building beats tightening to full-moon activation; closure as Charged Poise in "villages flickered alive," reconfiguring loss with legible cost in "tears carving clean tracks." Orientation anchors firmly by second paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Starlit station and churning sea constrain via wreckage scavenging and wind-whipped isolation, mirroring internal patchwork; censer foot as micro-setting charges final "patina gleam" image. Sensory hierarchy (salt-stung nights, lodestone hum) filters through Elias's navigator bias. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally with lunar phases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build beacon for reverse migration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through denser calls and moon fluctuations narrowing to ignition choice. Agency in mounting/lighting forecloses isolation path with tears as felt cost. Climax pressure coheres without coincidence resolution; minor abstractness in "geography of loss" slightly mutes visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of charting loss emerges organically via building from ghosts' voices and censer's pulse, culminating in non-literal "solace raw and real" reweighting reverse migration. Subtext in fluctuating relic avoids moralizing; final image resonates without tidy binaries. Counter-reading (ghosts as echoes) adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in scarred hands and ancestral tugs; voice modulates rhythmically from gritty isolation to charged poise. Cryptic calls carry distinct idiolect (gravelly father, hissing sister) pursuing goal advancement. No head-hopping; compression taught via lunar pattern pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short peak sentences ("Light it, navigator.") accelerating propulsion; density high, integrating sensory/action. Minor overwrite in "jagged map of villages emptied" metaphor string during early reflection deducts slightly, but no loops obscure closure. Varied openings avoid template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lodestone censer guiding ghost-built beacon transforms ghost story/reverse migration tropes via lunar causality and patchwork scars. Risky poetic compression heightens ingenuity without gimmick; final "woven ghosts into guides" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
