<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to preserve textures roots consistently in copper veins pulsing with tales and intensifies through elders' deaths and curse gamble; micro-choices like pocketing diamond reveal quiet resolve under peril. Final fulfillment earned via invocation feels character-particular. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses shown in scene caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to bird-synced symphony, closure as RR in diamond's hum and reborn echoes with cost of language death legible in "final tale etched eternally." One tightening via flock patterns narrows chaos into precision. Orientation anchored early in canyon/towers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and tunnel constrain choices—positioned diamond at mouth, shadows modulate echoes—charging final chorus image. Sensory textures (grit bass, silk harmonics) filter through Thorne's priorities, mirroring internal loss. Environment evolves causally with invocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dimming veins/curse risk to bird-deepening that reweights chaos with precision cost. Agency in chanting sync to wingbeats forecloses madness path. Entry to 8.8 via visible trade-off in solitude fulfillment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of broken vessels capturing dying essence emerges organically from flawed diamond transmuting textures, resonant in final reborn symphony without moralizing. Returning echoes reweight loss into guardianship. Closing image answers preservation question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with tactile diction ("rasp of bone on stone") matches quietly articulate POV; perceptual bias toward sonic textures selective and biased. Stable third-person limited, rhythmic control heightens climax invocation. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "copper veins igniting as he recalled"); varied rhythm suits accumulative build without loops. Minor repetitive phrasing ("quietly articulate," "across the death") purposeful but nudges down; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic textures, cursed diamond, bird fractals into language vault transforms tropes organically; risk in curse harness heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early motifs to eternal echoes. Bold perceptual frame feels singular.</comment>
