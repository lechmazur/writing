<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength in embodied motivation via precise shadow examinations tying to identity-sculpting drive; final doubt ("Had she always been Summer-Quill") reveals contradiction acting in scene. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("preemptively nostalgic heart aching") borders on unearned without deeper embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via shadows/whispers to CR closure ("Conjecture crystallized: identity was collective"); cost legible in doubt/unraveling fear reconfigured to wholeness. Orientation anchored early (observatory, fog-bridge); single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (rain-slick crystals amplifying whispers, fog-path sculpting steps) filters through archival POV, constraining traversal and charging final ascent. Environment evolves causally (storm wanes, shadows normalize), mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt identity via conjectures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intensifying whispers/shadow anomalies (forked shadow signaling schism) to Charged Poise; agency in examinations forecloses erasure path with felt unraveling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of collective identity emerges organically from shadow measures and whispers, culminating in resonant CR ("identity was collective, forged in shared hush") reweighting prior doubts without moralizing. Minor friction in semi-declarative line ("Collective memory endures not in stone").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (shadows as memory oracles, hush as affective texture); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but repetitive phrasing ("deepening hush" x3, "preemptively nostalgic" x3) creates paraphrase loops dulling peak momentum at final conjectures; figurative consistency voice-motivated offsets some overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival fantasy with shadow-measurement mechanics transforms nostalgia trope into ingenious method for memory dilution; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via final encircling shadow.</comment>
