<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's methodical planting and kindly sharing with pilgrims reveal contradictory impulses between haunted drive and gentle precision, earning final peace through prior isolation's void; no unearned epiphanies as change builds accumulatively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening via seed sprouting and relic decoding, landing Charged Poise/CR closure in final image of thriving vine and whispered thanks, cost legible in persistent "touching distance" veil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's wavering fields constrain planting choice and charge final humming stability, with iron-rich bark and levitated soil mirroring internal flux; sensory details (humming, shuddering) integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reestablishing harmony escalates accumulatively through arbor's descent risk narrowing to seed's stabilizing growth and communal decoding; agency in etching/inverting polarity forecloses collapse path with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transition as magnetic intimacy emerges organically from analogical particulars, final vine-binding image offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting haunted ambitions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with analogical perceptual signature (e.g., "particle shifting quantum states"); brief nomad dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythmic modulation suits lyric accumulative texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but minor "ambitions" paraphrase loops and synonym churn (haunted/reestablished) deduct; no closure harm, rhythm propels to etched final inscription.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform physics and magnetic mysticism transforms tropes via arbor/seed logic; risk-taking in analogical lyricism heightens stakes inevitably toward CR closure.</comment>
