<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in trembling hands syncing breath with cosmos; final change from tremors to "quiet power" earned via accumulative empathy. Minor diagnostic slips like "vulnerability was no weakness" abstract peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single star to shower, pattern breaks in personal memories, CR closure in tears pressing forehead to glass with emotional cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern glass as micro-setting constrains viewing choice and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (warmth seeping palms, humming scopes) filters through janitor's tactile priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength via vulnerability) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in meteor shower deepening to personal arc; agency in tracing paths forecloses fragility with tear-cost, but internal focus limits visceral external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from star paths mirroring losses; final image of broom with "janitor's quiet power" resonates non-literally, but explicit "strength bloomed: vulnerability... forge" nears moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature ("stardust that shimmered like forgotten memories"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "breath syncing with the cosmos's rhythm" without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but figurative overload ("vein of liquid sunlight," "branching veins") muddles coherence in shower beat; minor paraphrase loops on "vulnerability" in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise transforms solitude trope via lantern empathy; fresh synthesis of sci-fi lyricism risks poetic scope without gimmick, inevitable in "fall with grace" hindsight.</comment>
