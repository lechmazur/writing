<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in artistic fragmentation intensifies through descent choices; interiority particular but leans metaphorical over sharply embodied. Earned change at loom-weaving credible via prior tugs releasing memories. Rhetorical questions surface as reflective tic without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from untangling to weaving; on-page RR (Charged Poise) at loom with lingering ache as felt cost. "He wove the tarot cards into the loom" reconfigures fragments coherently. Single continuous descent scene fits scope; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting anchors early (lighthouse library, storm); bioluminescent fungi and closing walls constrain descent choices purposefully. Sensory integration vivid and POV-filtered via artist's fractured gaze. Walls' constriction charges final emergence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend fragmented reality) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via portals revealed and loom convergence; agency in untangling/weaving forecloses broken path. Ache as visible cost legible at "glowing scar of transformation." One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of shadowed renewal emerges organically from fragments-to-tapestry arc; final image ("light without shadow held any meaning?") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Rhetorical questions tilt toward overt articulation, slightly thinning subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature (prismatic gazes, glowing dust motes); rhythmic modulation builds intensity in descent. No dialogue to judge; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure descent ("walls pressed closer now, the storm's fury warping..."); mixed metaphors (e.g., Gordian snarl, phosphorescent waves) verge on muddle (-0.6). Varied rhythm propels but "rhetorical questions" loops (4 instances) add scaffold (-0.3). Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tarot-threads-loom synthesis transforms artist-fate trope organically; fresh descent-weaving redesign feels inevitable from established fragments. Risky metaphorical intensity heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
