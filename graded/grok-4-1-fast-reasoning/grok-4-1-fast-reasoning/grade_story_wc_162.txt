<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation rooted in sacred thresholds drives consistent micro-choices like grain analysis and hesitation at the log's warning; contradictory impulses peak in "Elowen hesitated in the hush," earning the final weaving of distance into arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (grain, codes, prisms) density-build to CR closure: realization reweights premise with conceptual cost of honored gaps; orientation anchored early ("drifting prism terrace"), no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood table's grain constrains discovery (unearths logbook) and charges final image (etched code); prism facets and corn sea evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite via sacred why) tightens accumulatively through intuitions narrowing options; log warning forces trade-off ("Close the distance, lose the light"), with agency in realignment and felt cost at crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Necessary distances emerge organically from particulars (grain curves, weather hashes), resonant CR ending reweights chaos-to-hush without moral; ambiguity lingers in "forever changed" post-reunion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("featherlight" traces, intuited codes) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates tension, elisions taught early (butterfly effect) pay off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via image-action fusion, but minor overwrite in metaphor stacks ("swirls tightened here, like paths... echoing flight logs") risks coherence in mid-discovery beat; no closure touch, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviator-maze codes post-butterfly prisms transforms tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable CR from grain-log-vector convergence feels non-obvious.</comment>
