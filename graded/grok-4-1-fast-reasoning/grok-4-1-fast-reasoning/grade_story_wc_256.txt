<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied emotions (pain lanced her, breath caught) and micro-choices (adjusting lens to weave sounds) reveal contradictory impulses of doubt and resolve, earning final reconfiguration with tears' cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via chamber progression tightening density toward CR closure ("scarred, resonant grit" reweights premise) with felt cost in knelt tears and rising; orientation anchored early in lab/power stabilization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (prism-song fracturing tones, carbide lens sharpening waves) filters through POV urgency; lens/recurring shadows constrain choices and charge final pulse image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, escalates texturally via doubt-driven deepenings narrowing assumptions (volume to silence to grit) with agency in lens refractions; cost unmistakable in shattered pain and final unveiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sonic particulars to resonant CR ("disconnection was the forge"); final image offers non-literal answer reweighting journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct sonic/perceptual signature ("rainbows of timbre," "silken threads"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, elision purposeful/lyric-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor figurative density ("golden shadows pooled like molten amber") in peaks purposeful for textural lens but borders overwrought without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh sonic pilgrimage premise synthesizes lab-world/loss into inevitable CR; risk-taking lyric structure heightens textural stakes organically.</comment>
