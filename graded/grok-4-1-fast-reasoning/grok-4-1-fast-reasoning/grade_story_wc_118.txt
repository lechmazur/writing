<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thorne's odd perceptiveness drives probing into sealed chamber and decoding diaries, earning shift to fulfillment; contradictory dreamless void vs. wall-listening anchors endurance with felt cost in final settling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of discoveries (diaries to tapestry) tightening axis riddle to CR closure; "dreamless man dreaming through stone" reconfigures curse to chronicle with undeniable conceptual cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tilted silo with upward dust motes and warped gravity constrains perception and probing choices; recurring "bronze quiet" and wall-whispers charge final image of eternal listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collecting axis stories tightens accumulatively through layered discoveries narrowing to renunciation of realignment for archival endurance; cost legible in "anchored him against the dreamless void."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of myths bleeding into ruins emerges via tapestry-diary alignment, reweighted in final pillar-mounting without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in historian's own wall-story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature filters warped silo through sensitive ears and vibrations; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Purposeful poetic density with "bronze quiet" refrain propels texturally, but minor paraphrase loops on "displaced axis" (e.g., repeated "haunted/warped/thrummed") slightly dull mid-discovery beats without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Tilt silo-walls as story-absorbers with dragon-tapestry as axis guardian transforms mythic tropes organically; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes in quiet CR.</comment>
