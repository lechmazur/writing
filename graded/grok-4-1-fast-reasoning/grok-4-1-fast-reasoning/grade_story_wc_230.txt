<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's rational traits drive precise micro-choices like measuring the socket thrice and testing lies on Lira/Thom, earning the final duality endurance with embodied pain and doubt. Contradictory impulses surface in the gloaming ponder: occlusion heals or deceives. Minor abstraction in emotions ("shattered with blunt admissions") dilutes peak embodiment slightly, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern of storms/fractures builds to CR closure in "had occlusion truly healed, or merely draped the fractures in silken deceit?"—repricing truth with duality cost. One tightening via relic discovery to insertion tests safety motive. Gate caps at 8.7 due to Q7 prose debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-battered ravine/orchard constrains foraging and aerie rite, mirroring internal tempests; truffle soil anchors rational tools. Sensory selection (winds howl elegies, thunder assents) biases via Elias's data-folkloric tension. Charges final "smiled into the gale" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety via truth-cure) signaled early tightens accumulatively: probe snag to insertion reversal forces relational trade-off tested on Lira/Thom. Agency peaks in rite; cost legible in occluded doubts charging duality poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Truth vs. merciful shadows emerges organically via relic occlusion events, resonating in final duality image that reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in veiled dialogues layers complexity. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature blends rational probes with poetic distortion post-insertion. Dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden ("I see boundless potential" evades data grimness). Rhythmic modulation under stress clean; minor filter in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with vivid rhythm, but overwrought metaphors ("lightning etched the sky’s fractures") crowd insertion beat without pattern payoff, dragging peak slightly. Minor paraphrase loops ("fractured grace" motif over-repeated). No closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of virus-truth curse, glass-eye neurology relic, and truffle rationality transforms post-apoc tropes boldly. Inevitable hindsight via textbook rite to duality CR. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
