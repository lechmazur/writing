<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in bloodline curse, compelling vendetta choices like poisoning; however, interiority leans poetic abstraction over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in murmured confessions without shown hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oriented early via lighthouse prison and Elias's heritage; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of shades/motifs building to RR closure in core chamber where shades merge into hush, cost felt in impending body discovery ("before they found the bodies").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "salt-etched windows" and "copperlight pooled like molten repose" filter through Elias's hush-chasing bias; lattice and scuffs constrain path and charge final replacement image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hush/redemption signaled early, escalates accumulatively via binding shades with confessions that narrow to core chamber; agency in threading story forecloses cries with visible cost of hidden bodies tightening pre-discovery pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth silencing lies emerges organically from wolf-shades bound by narrative, culminating in resonant CR where "no more cries of wolf; only the sea's murmur" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in repetitive hush/repose diction; purposeful poetic compression taught early sustains lyric texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "hush," "repose," "copperlight" creates motif density but triggers −0.6 for paraphrase loops and figurative overload dulling propulsion, e.g., adjacent "reposeful sheen" and "molten repose"; rhythm varies but elevated register drifts in peak maze threading.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "boy who cried wolf" into labyrinth-threading redemption with hovering shades sustained by confessional lattice; risk-taking in mythic-poetic frame heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
