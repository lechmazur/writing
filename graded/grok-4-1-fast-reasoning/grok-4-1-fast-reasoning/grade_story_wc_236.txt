<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied calm ("fingers, steady yet trembling") and micro-choices like extracting the screw, rooting motivation in lost smell turned intuition; final repair earns change with felt cost of her losses. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("mapped emotional terrain") slightly abstracts peak insight without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation in shop/fog, density builds via screw discovery to backstory intuition, CR closure in shared story and tears reconfiguring repair's meaning with conceptual cost of occluded pasts; cost legible in "her own losses humanized."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog and workbench constrain choices (fogged views limit sight, forcing touch), recurring fog thinning charges final gold light image mirroring revelation; sensory hierarchy (plink syncing pulse, no smell) filters via POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil miracle via repair) signaled early, tightens at screw find narrowing to intuitive backstory, agency in fashioning compartment; cost felt in trembling focus yielding relief, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles through occluded humanizing emerges organically from screw's arc; final handover image resonates as non-literal answer reweighting losses without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (touch/sound dominance); rhythmic texture modulates (short plink sentences build hush), purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy artifacts in final third ("But wait, the count exceeds—trimming thoughts," meta word-count notes) dull closure image with loops and scaffold; paraphrase redundancy ("humanized" overuse) and register drift into self-aware generator voice obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water clock repair intuiting midwife tale via clamp screw transforms antique trope into emotional archaeology; risk in lyric fog motif heightens stakes organically.</comment>
