<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Elias's pondering of his "unpardonable silences" act in scene, compelling the closure choice to press the bolt back with earned cost via Thorne's parallel; Thorne's gestures reveal flaws without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught imagery tightening to CR closure—"Elias pressed the bolt back... nodding. 'I understand'"—reconfiguring safety's cost legibly; orientation anchored early, bolt causal turn pays off without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress and staircase constrain discovery and isolation choices, charging final image of enduring spires; sensory details (prickling fire, dust motes) filter through regenerating nerves, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety's cost) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bolt/logs to agency in confrontation/renunciation, foreclosing outcry with soul-cost in "regeneration complete, not just nerves, but soul."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence theme emerges via parallel regrets, reweighted non-literally in Elias's whisper and choice to remain without moralizing; final image answers "What did safety demand?" through charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual signature of neural tingling biasing details; rhythmic prose modulates from hazy to ignited clarity, elisions (logs) taught and paid off in understanding without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful choir/ice motifs propels without loops, though minor synonym churn in "silence" motifs in mid-section slightly dulls one beat; peak confrontation image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural regen, silent choir sabotage, bolt-etching transforms silence trope organically; risk in gestural "voiceless aria" heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
