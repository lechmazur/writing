<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's embodied "mulberry ache" and contradictory solitary dream vs. propagated sharing impulses act simultaneously in the violin-lifting beat; final composer choice earned by prior weighing and plant pressure with throb cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of stains, ivy whispers, and visions builds to RR closure in crescendo shattering rift, reconfiguring perforated destiny with ache transmuted—cost legible in "resolute throb."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's ivy constrains by pulsing telepathically on brush, enabling propagation and charging final "new growth" pulse; sensory hierarchy (humid mulberry, quivering leaves) mirrors internal mend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant dream-empire stake signaled in opening weigh; textural escalation via stain arabesques tightening to thorned crowns, then ivy urging and violin play narrowing to hybrid with on-page throb cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perforated destiny theme emerges organically from stains/vines/violin, final shatter offering non-literal hybrid answer reweighting rigid empire via "laced with propagating life" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in verdant whispers and stain arabesques; rhythmic swell in "notes cascading like glacial avalanches" modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via motif integration, but figurative stack ("steam curling like spectral fingers... dew on midnight petals") in brew-to-note beats risks minor muddle, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plant-telepathic propagation of ice violin harmonies transforms empire-dream trope into fresh organic synthesis; risky lyric texture inevitable in hindsight from stains-to-crescendo.</comment>
