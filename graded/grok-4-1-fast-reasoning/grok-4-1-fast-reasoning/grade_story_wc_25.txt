<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias's traits—map mastery, walk identification, whisper tactic—drive consistent micro-choices under storm pressure, earning the win; Harlan's arrogance contrasts sharply in dialogue and defeat. Internal contradiction shows in feigned disinterest masking "mind raced with calculated spontaneity." Minor flaw: motivation feels slightly told in murmur rather than fully embodied pre-challenge.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: storm strands them therefore challenge; shouts scramble therefore whispers guide to first arrival and zodiac alignment unlocking Heart. On-page DC closure with Harlan's forfeiture cost legible in "maps surrendered, pride shattered." Orientation anchored early in ladder rung and container maze; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Labyrinth containers constrain paths and sound propagation, charging final climb-out with "walks of defeated rivals fading"; storm auroras scramble tech, narrowing to paper/instinct. Sensory hierarchy: Elias notices walks amid "groaning" steel, professional bias sharp. Micro-setting of zodiac wheel on Heart door forces key tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—win race/proof via whispers—tightens causally as Harlan's yells lead to dead ends, forcing Elias's map mimicry trade-off. Protagonist agency in whispering directions and aligning symbols forecloses Harlan's lead with visible cost in cursing arrival. Escalation driven by storm pressure, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of subtlety conquering chaos emerges implicitly from whisper victory over shouts, resonant in final "whispers of victory humming farther than any roar" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in coin flip echoes bet; ambiguity lingers in Elias's "calculated leap." No overt statements, complexity in sound physics.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias: notices "clip-clop" arrogance, filters storm via bass waves. Dialogue subtextual—Harlan's barks vs. Elias murmurs pursue goals, distinct idiom. Rhythmic prose modulates tension, e.g., short strides matching creases; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: sentences layer action, sound physics, perception without padding; rhythm varies with storm peaks. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors like "pocket-sized prophecies" doesn't muddle closure. Slight paraphrase loop in "whispers" refrain thematic, not artifact; propulsive to coin-warm fist.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm enabling whisper physics in container maze, zodiac key as magnetic aligner, transforms race trope via sound/walk/map ingenuity. Risk in conceptual lock pays off hindsight-inevitable; no template echoes, bold physics integration heightens stakes.</comment>
