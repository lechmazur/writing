<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to collect burdens drives all choices, intensifying in the thief's fractal that pulls her heart; embodied panic flickers like the lamp in the trap moment. Interiority concrete via fractal diffusion, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from weaving to merging fractals trapping her boundary-lessly, cadence shift via calcification with cost (diffused form coalesces) in final paragraphs. Orientation anchored early ("bronze grotto's walls"); closure as RR/Charged Poise legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze-veined grotto and starlight constrain choices (apex alignment for weave/calcify), charging final monument image; sensory hush and meltwater evolve causally. Micro-setting (burner as altar) shapes climax tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens without collapse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via merging fractals' trap, agency in orienting burner forces trade-off with felt cost (solidified freedom). One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transcending infinite burdens via calcification emerges organically from particulars, resonant non-literal answer in "grand fractal now a calcified monument" reweighting recursion's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractal patterns, hush layers); voice modulates rhythmically in reverie to trap intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density in fractal weaves; minor figurative density in peak trap ("suspended in the infinite") coherent but borders overwrite without muddle (−0.3). No loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal burdens and calcification under starlight feels inevitable; risk-taking in boundary-less recursion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
