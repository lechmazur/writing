<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reclaim unused love drives concrete micro-choices like pressing the film strip to her pendant, earning her pocketed fragment and transformation. Interiority particular via spatial mapping of visions; embodied emotions in "veins" flooding. Minor slip: backstory of fiancé feels slightly diagnostic without mid-crisis contradiction acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from film touch to box discovery to CR closure: "love stored not in boxes, but in the spatial architecture," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of eternal incubation. Orientation anchored early in booth; single scene causality holds via vision linkages narrowing spatial knowledge. Cost legible in final projector reunion image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Booth's ducts, panel, projector constrain choices, charging final rewind image. Sensory hierarchy spatial/tactile via POV bias; details evolve causally (pried panel yields box). Weather (thunder) syncs revelation without dominance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused love storage) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via psychometry tightening spatial options to box find. Agency in incubation/prying forecloses inert love path with cost of her own vow's half-spoken ache now hatched. Escalation coheres under lens with lyrics/storm density break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love's spatial migration emerges via particulars (letters to architecture); final image reconfigures goodbye to hello without moral. Subtext in locket warmth/lost fiancé echo invites ambiguity on unclaimed essence. Resonant non-literal answer charges prior visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with spatial perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythm in visions ("bloomed...flooding"). Poetic diction consistent, purposeful compression in scrying. Minor register elevation in peak ("gestate in the darkness") borders opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density but figurative overload in vision beat ("tactile memories flooding her veins... swirled, lyrics pleading") dulls propulsion amid pressure; −0.6 for density without pattern payoff. Varied rhythm, clean syntax; no loops but synonym churn on "incubating."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, spatial imagination, migrating lyrics transforms spectral trope into love's architectural storage. Risky lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight via booth relics.</comment>
