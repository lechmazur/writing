<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's persistence and quartz eye root motivations consistently, compelling higher-stakes mending; Lila's feistiness shows in scoff and shove, forcing relational crucible. Internal conflict embodied in clutching ribbon amid fear of irrelevance. Minor label-speak ("endearingly feisty") slightly undercuts, but final shared renewal earns change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: breach causes wild orchard and persistence, bag spill triggers surge, Lila's return and storm force mending DC. Closure as RR in visions and "roots that regrow" with felt relational cost legible in Elias's masked fear revealed. Orientation anchored early in cathedral climb; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard rafters constrain climbs and storm peril, charging final swirling leaves image. Sensory details (dripping sap, rustle, thunder) selective via Elias's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Spatial choreography clear in scaling to apex amid falling beam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge wisdom via mending) signaled early, tightens causally through bag find and Lila's news, narrowing to heart-tree under storm. Agency in joint repair; cost visible in beam fall save and orchard excess from unbound vows. Escalation coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges via orchard excess and visions' intimate truths, reweighting vows non-literally in final image. Subtext in ribbon tie and locket scroll; ambiguity lingers in feistiness fueling return. Lila's closing line borders thematic echo, slightly softening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias-dominant focalization; perceptual bias in quartz glimpses and vine grips. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Superstitions," yet persists), distinct idioms (Lila snaps, Elias soft). Rhythmic prose modulates with storm intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bag spill advances plot/emotion); rhythm varies, propulsion fits beats. Lush metaphors consistent orchard-patterned, no muddle. Minor fig-lang density in opening and synonym echoes ("persist") dock slightly, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz eyes, rafter orchard, deciduous vows synthesize fresh premise organically; tropes (estranged daughter) transformed via mender craft and storm mend. Risky lush fantasy grounded in tactile choices heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
