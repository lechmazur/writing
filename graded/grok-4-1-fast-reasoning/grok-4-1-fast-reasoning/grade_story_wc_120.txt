<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied chronological homesickness fueling micro-choices like mapping memories onto the shell despite trembling exhaustion. Contradictory impulses—ache versus persistence—act simultaneously as she conducts toward collapse. Final endurance/renunciation of homesickness feels earned with visible cost in her gentle collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mapped memories builds to CR closure in eternal harmony, with exhaustion as felt cost in "She collapsed gently onto the ice." Orientation anchored early in spire/lake. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and mirrored horizon constrain choices (mapping, conducting) and charge final image of etched spirals. Sensory details (pearlescent glow, ice vibration) filtered through Elara's nostalgic bias, evolving causally with symphony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphonies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory-mapping to crescendo, narrowing to exhaustion trade-off. Agency in waving shell forces stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in collapse before "true exhaustion claimed her."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of past-to-harmony emerges organically from particulars like shell spirals and symphony motifs, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: homesickness orchestrated into "eternal harmony," inviting reflection on silence-as-song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (logarithmic time curls) stable in close third POV, modulating rhythm with intensity—no head-hopping. Diction/rhythm heighten pressure in crescendo beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush," "mirrored horizon") recur without full pattern payoff, docking in non-closure beats; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing, shell-mapping, and symphonic nostalgia transforms tropes into bold lyric risk; inevitable in hindsight via nautilus as baton in frozen-mirror climax.</comment>
