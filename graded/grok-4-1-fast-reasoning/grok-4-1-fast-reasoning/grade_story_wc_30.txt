<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Librarian's core motivation to preserve wonder compels precise smelting ritual; Elara's contradictory impulses embodied in writhing orb ("archivist clashed with cartographer"). Minor slip: librarian reads more archetypal than individually flawed under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds to on-page RR closure as smelted essence rises ("molten harmony emerged"), reconfiguring Elara's flux with legible cost in yielded paradox; orientation anchored early in atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains action—waves lap ankles, orb bounces off swelling tides ("tides that swelled with lunar pull"), crest higher mirroring ritual escalation; recurring bamboo-weave echoes scrolls for charged final drip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity migration) signaled early, tightens texturally via evading orb pursuit and forge writhe; librarian's agency forces acceptance trade-off, cost felt in potential shatter avoided through paradox yield.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved via contradiction acceptance emerges organically from ritual ("I accept you, whole and halved"); final image reweights routine with awe ("maps unfurled... laced with enduring awe"), resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-person, perceptual signature via gear-whirrs and tidal pulses; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Your core fluctuates wildly"); rhythm modulates serene to heated forge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose motifs purposefully (tides/gears recur to build texture); minor paraphrase loops in "wonder" and "cycle" phrasing, but pattern-taught without dulling ritual propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of post-calendar tidal library, gear-librarian smelting moon-flux identities with creel transforms tropes; risk-taking in alchemical paradox closure feels inevitable from world logic.</comment>
