<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to crystallize emotion drives ritual with embodied conflict—omitting bitterness for purer vision—earned by memory's haze; final doubt as Earned Stasis shows contradictory impulses acting in the scattering beat. Interiority particular via mask shards glinting like fractured memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds ritually to chair's falter (pattern break), culminates in powdering/scattering (cadence shift) with CR closure—doubt reweights ritual's premise, cost legible as "cold in his chest" and inert chair void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery and chair constrain rite—ash spirals to vanishing point, chair's stop triggers climax—charging final image; sensory hierarchy (creak's metronome, scorched scent) filtered through Elias' grief bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallize smile) signaled early, tightens via chair falter forcing rite under accumulative lens; agency in powdering forecloses pure preservation with doubt's cost felt on-page, though internal pressure dominates over external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of illusory safety emerges organically from selective weaving and ritual, resonant CR in final doubt—"merely the mirage"—reweights prior acts without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in powder's impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with perceptual signature (grief-warped illusions); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at mask removal, diction purposeful and biased toward fractured wholeness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor loops ("weave truth carefully," "mirage of safety," "somber marvel") and end artifacts ([word counts]) create scaffold drag without obscuring closure; rhythm varies naturally overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-ritual in optical-illusion gallery transforms grief tropes; risk in powdering/smile's destruction heightens conceptual cost, inevitable via chair's gears and vanishing points.</comment>
