<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Traits like orderly intuition drive graffiti plans and flotilla alignment, earning final resolution of dual allegiance; however, label-heavy telling ("attribute shone," "dual allegiance peaked") undermines embodied contradiction in peak beats like yacht painting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via meeting Kai therefore graffiti series therefore reorganization; multi-shard structure (twilight to weeks passed) taught by action pattern but lacks single tightening to closure's Charged Poise ("Aquafeste bobbed triumphant"); cost legible in lingered privatization shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Raft city carnival vividly filters through Elara's priorities (chaos sensed amid neon frenzy), constraining choices like parade-masked shuffle; foundation stone chip charges final pocketed warmth image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to save carnival tightens causally through adaptive graffiti despite enforcers, forcing trade-offs like patrol blind spots; agency peaks in yacht map-paint with felt desperation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Coexistence theme emerges organically from graffiti blending chaos/order; final "dual allegiances could coexist" offers resonant reweighting, but repetitive "hopeful desperation" echoes dilute subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (intuitive order amid swirl) stable in single POV; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven ("I've seen the contracts").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax, but paraphrase loops in ending ("bobbed triumphant... danced eternal... carnival forever") and repeated "foundation stone chip clutching" create scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Graffiti codes as resistance synthesize carnival/gentrification freshly, transforming tropes through decoded vines/binary; risk in encoded secrecy heightens stakes organically.</comment>
