<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in longing intensifies to compel full sacrifice at climax, with embodied essence-fraying cost; interiority concrete through loom actions, though contradictory impulses more latent than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to Charged Poise closure—tapestry vanishes as Elara fades to mist with life-force cost legible in "body slumping... form faded"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via puzzle find.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bamboo/orchard vividly constrains rite (stalks lean, silence raveled) and charges final image (hushed eternal, bead half-buried); sensory selection purposeful through wistful POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message across gulf) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puzzle scaffold to frenzy-weave with agency-fueled deepening; life-cost unmistakable at "poured her wistful core... dimming".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial weaving emerges organically from particulars, final bead-waiting image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation with enduring hope at mortal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with weaver-biased perceptual signature (threads as longing); diction/rhythm modulate to frenzy clack-clack under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("raveling silence", "unraveling tapestry") purposeful for accumulative texture but risks loop; figurative density overwrites climax weave beat without full propulsion payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle edges + amber bead + loom transforms message trope into irreplaceable rite; risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
