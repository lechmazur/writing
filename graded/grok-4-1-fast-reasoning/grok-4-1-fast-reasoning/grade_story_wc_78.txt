<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to turn obstacles into instruments compels micro-choices like lashing debris into xylophone, with restlessness as embodied flaw persisting to "sated for the moment." Internal conflict in "harmony clashed against chaos" acts simultaneously. Minor abstraction in "motivation burned deep" but earned change at slump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density swells from cloud sketches to fractal dome repelling beam as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in "perfection was illusion" and half-kept promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and debris constrain choices, supplying bars for xylophone and charging climax. Sensory hierarchy: thrums, hums narrow to mallet strikes amid swells. Final roots gripping mirror initial haven, recharging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prophesy/survive via euphony) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through rogue wave to massive beam. Agency in fractal strikes forecloses capsize with cost in slumping exhaustion. Coherent pressure to final navigable maelstrom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peril-to-prophecy emerges organically via debris transmuted; final "dreamed of waves unbound, instruments eternal" offers CR reweighting endless seas without moral. Ambiguity in persistent restlessness lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in fractal/vibration bias (e.g., "patterns of vibration etched in vapor"). Rhythmic modulation swells with pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm supports euphony build; minor figurative muddle in "visible mandalas of shimmer, branching like lightning frozen in harmony" slightly blurs peak. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal music from shipwreck debris transforms survival trope organically. Risky afloat orchard premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight at dome repel. Bold voice heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
