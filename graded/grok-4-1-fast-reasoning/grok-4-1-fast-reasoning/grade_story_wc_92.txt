<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to spark revolution roots consistently in vigilant traits, shown via inventive decoding and risk-taking passes; actions align under pressure. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken peak depth, but micro-choices like pocketing crystal reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly detection to spark activation to ally handoff, tightening rebellion pattern. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in revolution's hum and Elara's plotting smile, with felt risk cost legible in "blackout's embrace." Orientation anchors early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phosphor veins, cool stone, refracted shadows vividly constrain choices like sundial alignment and vault insertion. Twilight's "sly grin" charges final image, mirroring internal hush; sensory hierarchy fits sentinel bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution vs. Overwardens) signaled early; accumulative escalation via blackout-enabled decodings narrows options, forcing handoff trade-off. Agency in quill twists shows cost in exposure risk, charging poise at revolution's simmer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle ignition emerges organically from sparks, angles, hush; final image reweights "cradle" metaphor with revolution's unstoppable hum. Avoids moralizing, lingers in ambiguity of dawn's approach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: inventive calm filters anomalies into coded plays. Voice texture modulates rhythmically, poetic diction fits fantasy hush; minimal dialogue natural, subtextual in Mira whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("winking hush," "calmly inventive," "cradle" phrasing) create paraphrase churn in ending third, dulling propulsion; −1.1 total artifacts. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors like "thief in velvet gloves" borders muddle in buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sundial codes and quill wards transforms rebellion trope into intricate, phosphor-veined intrigue. Risky poetic compression heightens sly tone without gimmick; ending reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
