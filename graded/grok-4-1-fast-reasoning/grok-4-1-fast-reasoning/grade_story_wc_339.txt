<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's analytic solitude and Elias intimacy drive conflicted plunges, earning the globe-release epiphany; embodied equations reveal flaws without diagnostic flattening at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds from plane mention to note/globe cascade, delivering CR closure in release and ascent with conceptual cost of unbound superposition legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brine-bloated books and gloved silt interactions constrain choices, with snow globe as recurring micro-setting charging the final swirl-and-resettle image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to decode letting-go deepens texturally via transmission pierce and globe shake, agency foreclosing attachment in release with sated melancholy as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transmission and globe particulars reprice entanglement non-literally, resonant CR ending reweighting dives without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Analytic perceptual signature ("sediment from truth") holds stable POV distance, rhythmic modulation heightening closure without elision or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density physics motifs propel without loops; figurative density coheres lyrically, minor overload in opener spared as it doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantum letting-go synthesis of Earhart artifacts and diver's Death yields fresh, inevitable CR; risk-taking in refraction payoff heightens without gimmick.</comment>
