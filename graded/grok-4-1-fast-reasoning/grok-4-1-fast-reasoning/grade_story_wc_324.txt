<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's persistent curiosity overrides caution in tampering with the hearing aid, embodying contradiction that drives the relay to Clara; Clara's recoil to sobs traces realistic progression with cost in foreclosed suicide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via escalating echo/pulse density to charged poise closure as Clara rises, pulses spent; photo-to-aid discovery tightens without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight constrain approach (mist parts) and charge final thinning/exhale; hearing aid as micro-setting tool anchors pulses, mirroring internal echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing/protecting voices tightens accumulatively as aid pulses urge assurance, narrowing to confrontation; cost legible in Clara's hollow-to-steadied shift and spent pulses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges via Elara's unplanned relay reweighting death/life divide; final pocketed aid offers resonant answer to protecting echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature tunes to pulses/hush; dialogue distinct and subtextual, with Clara's "Why you?" pursuing stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("reeling hush," "vulnerable voices," "faint pulses") creates minor loops and synonym churn, dulling density in coda; rhythm strong otherwise, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hearing aid as pulse-tracker synthesizes heart-tracing premise freshly, transforming relic trope; incidental save via curiosity risks poetic voice inevitably.</comment>
