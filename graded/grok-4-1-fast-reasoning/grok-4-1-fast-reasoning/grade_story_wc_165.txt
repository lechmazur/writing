<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in analytical traits, compelling the orchestration; Jasper's micro-choices under crowd pressure reveal values. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal planning beat. Secondary characters apply pressure effectively but briefly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: planning → precise scattering → bishop landing → connection. Closure as CR via final harmony reconfiguring monotony with Jasper's hidden cost legible in "slipped away." Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (spray, clamor, tide groans) filters through Jasper's analytical bias; constrains bishop's trajectory via wind/tide. Charges final image: "tidal arcade thrummed on, forever subtly altered."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenading monotony) signaled early; causal escalation tightens via calibrated throw narrowing chance to success. Agency in orchestration; cost felt in anonymous payoff charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ordered chaos emerges organically from chess orchestration and final collective; resonant CR in "randomness ordered into wild harmony" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with analytical perceptual signature (dissecting patterns); voice modulates rhythmically. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but minor artifacts: exact "lightly attentive" repeat and synonym churn ("monotony" variants) dull propulsion slightly in setup. No closure impact; strong image propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as chaos-tool in arcade; risk in orchestrated chance transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via bishop's diagonal path.</comment>
