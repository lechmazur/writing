<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove enduring kindness is embodied in trembling fingers and chest warmth, with doubt as contradictory impulse shown in paused brush; final sleep earns closure via prior exhaustion cost. Minor abstract phrasing in visions doesn't touch pivotal trance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions and city responses build density to CR closure where Elias sleeps amid glowing symbols, reweighting doubt with undeniable proof cost in banished insomnia. Anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse jungle and smog-choked city constrain painting on panes and charge final womb image; sensory details (fogged glass, vine brush) filter through Elias's hopeful bias, evolving with moon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness remembered) signaled early; accumulative escalation via deepening visions and stranger beacons narrows doubt, charging sleep with felt exhaustion cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kindness chains emerges via glyph visions and city flickers; final unbroken chains image resonantly reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity in "erased epochs."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (saffron inks, moon-kissed tip); rhythmic modulation heightens trance without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (saffron motifs); minor overwriting in vision cascade ("daydreams bloomed/cascaded") doesn't obscure closure image of curling among pots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost languages as kindness vessels via moon-brush visions transforms trope of isolated artist; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
