<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via poetic verses and embodied sewing under trance pressure; motivation to defy precedents earns the final mending with felt risk cost. Minor label-speak in "hauntingly optimistic" slightly abstracts impulses without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from entry to sewn tapestry closure as Resonant Reconfiguration, with conceptual cost of dissolved traditions legible in dawn's glow filtering through cracks. Orientation anchored early at water's edge; single scene progression coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory palette (damp earth, brine, glowing petroglyphs) filters through Elara's weaver bias; canyon walls and orchid thread constrain sleepwalking choices and charge final blooming image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence vs. forbidden labyrinth) signaled early; sleep-sewing deepens pressure under Accumulative lens via path overlaps, foreclosing rigid precedents with risk of permanent loss felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fluid dream-mending over broken rituals emerges organically from stitching chaos into coherence; final summit image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting tradition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with poetic perceptual signature (verses humming seams); rhythmic compression suits trance escalation, pattern-taught early without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but dense figurative layering ("gossamer threads dyed the hue of orchid solace") borders overwriting in sewing climax, slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalking surrealism and literal path-mending transforms maze trope; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
