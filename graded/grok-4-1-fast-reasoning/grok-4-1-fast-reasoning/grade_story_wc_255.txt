<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—yearning for color yet rejecting it via imperfect song—act simultaneously at the phoenix barter, earning the renunciation with tactile motivation rooted in prior glass-tracing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: plant code → reed retrieval → spire climb → warped song creates RR closure as phoenix accepts imperfection over sight, with cost legible in unchanged blindness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard's warped glass spires and plants constrain choices (codes, climb) and charge final bubbled pane image, filtered tactilely through colorblind POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to awaken Mira tightens at phoenix counter-demand for sight; Elias's agency in warbling imperfection forecloses that option with legible cost under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of touching bubbled pane reweights barter premise non-literally: imperfection trumps perfection, emerging from song barter without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with tactile perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulates from descriptive buildup to terse climax blow, dialogue sparse but subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops or muddle; figurative layering (e.g., "warbling hum warped by inexact breath") purposeful in barter peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant codes, reed barter, colorblind rejecting sight via dissonant song transforms phoenix trope; cunning ploy inevitable from flaw-celebrating buildup.</comment>
