<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's defiance and mischief drive consistent choices, like warping nursery ditties to lure youths and refracting verses sharply, earning her final prismatic victory with felt cost in father's faded paintings. Internal conflict embodied in veiled resolve under elders' gaze. Group yields clear pressure without diluting her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry density swells from solo verse to collective chant, tightening to CR closure where spire shimmers with rainbows, splintering forgiveness with conceptual cost in faltering ritual. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain via amplification, charging final rainbow refractions on bone; mist-veiled spire pulses, mirroring rising doubts. Sensory hierarchy sharpens on resonant cadence and marrow pool. Micro-setting (vertebrae perch) guides mischievous orchestration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shatter forgiveness via refraction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as session swells with deepened doubts—"forgiveness forges chains"—forcing Elara's sharper prompts; agency in orchestration narrows options with spies' ashen faces as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fractured forgiveness emerges organically through verses like "price our very echoes?", culminating in resonant CR: spire's rainbows reweight monolith into jagged edges without moralizing. Subtext in hesitations and weeps invites ambiguity on balm vs. blade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in paint-smeared tracing and warped ditties; voice poetic yet distinct—Elara's silken hooks vs. boy's stammer. Dialogue goal-driven, subtext-laden: "Peace? Or prison?" Rhythm modulates with giggles to piercing laughter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful echoes/refracts building texture; rhythm varies, propulsion strong in cascading verses. Minor artifact: "innocently mischievous" loops (x3) without full pattern payoff deducts, but no closure touch or filter stacks. No paraphrase runs dulling peak chant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-canyon poetry revolution transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in spire's bending light. Non-obvious defiance via prismatic verses personalizes grudge.</comment>
