<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's reticence cracks authentically in "I can't stay, but this... I'll protect it," revealing warmth through action; Harlan's cough and confessions deepen motives. Traits like observation constrain dialogue sparsity effectively. Minor archetype lean in skipper archetype without strong internal contradiction limits higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries of stones/notes build density to CR closure in Elias rebuilding the stack with his note, cost felt in Harlan's rattle and Elias shoving off alone. Orientation anchored early in skiff approach. Single scene fits defaults; one tightening via note chain revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room constrains via fog, shadows twisting "like grasping fingers," charging climax; sea glass and stones as micro-settings evolve tactilely, mirroring internal glow. Sensory hierarchy (salt whispers, wet cough) reflects Elias's priorities. Final dawn gleam recharges storm-lashed opener.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving safety's glow) signaled in lamp snuff-out, escalates accumulatively via worsening cough/haunt to Elias's vow, narrowing "stay" option with felt cost of departure. Agency in pocketing glass/writing note forecloses inaction. One deepening via chain history coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bottling safety emerges organically from note particulars (child's hand, lamp spark), reweighted in Elias's "stone that doesn't fall" reply without statement. Subtext in Harlan's hidden replies invites ambiguity on isolation's solace. Final stack sentinel offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Elias with perceptual bias (traces silhouettes, brushes stacks); voice texture in "luminescent ache" modulates storm intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Pocket that"), advances revelation. No head-hopping; rhythm tightens at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Density high with multi-job lines (e.g., "flickered like a dying heartbeat" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("grasping fingers," "captured tear") and repetitive "warmth" phrasing dull peak slightly (−0.4). No loops touching closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as message code transforms lighthouse trope ingeniously, synthesized via chain into fresh premise of preserved glow. Risk in haunted lyricism heightens isolation stakes organically. No derivative echoes; final vow feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
