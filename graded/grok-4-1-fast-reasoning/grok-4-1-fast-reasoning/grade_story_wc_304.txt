<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in duality, with contradictory service impulse yielding to self-infusion at climax ("Pain lanced"); earned change forecloses oblivion path with embodied cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density to dual infusion DC; closure cost legible in "Pain lanced; brilliance erupted," with persistent constraint of dimming spark shaping tactics; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto's static and aurora constrain pattern-finding and surge climax, charging final nexus image; sensory hierarchy (visual crackles, air hum) reflects lucid watchfulness, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, tightens via inward turn under Accumulative lens; agency in self-infusion forecloses oblivion with unmistakable pain cost on climax page, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defying oblivion via duality emerges organically through spark fusion; final ward image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting service vs. self, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (patterns in static) stable in single POV; rhythmic control heightens infusion pressure without slippage, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative weave (aurora coils, helix light) propels to closure; minor overload in climax metaphors ("veins of viridian fire") tempers from 9+, but no loops or artifacts dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual and static patterns yields inevitable self-infusion; risk-taking in inward helix turn heightens stakes, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
