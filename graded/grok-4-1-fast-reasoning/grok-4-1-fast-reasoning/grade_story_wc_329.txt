<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly from subtle signaling to fierce uprooting at climax, rooted in consistent traits like callused fingers and clutched shell. Interiority concrete via embodied pulse-syncing and shell-warming, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music's density builds from whispers to swelling pulse, tightening to DC closure in uprooting with legible cost (shell cracks, cry merges bow-scrape). Orientation anchored early; single scene with seamless descent transition fits defaults. Lens taught early via violin's "resonantly soft" signaling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—statue patrols force "resonantly soft" music; sky-bridge enables descent rush—and charges final image of unrusting blossoms. Sensory hierarchy violinist-specific (auditory whirring, rusting scents). Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical order) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pulse density narrowing options (evade sensors → trees throb → statues converge). Protagonist agency drives tightening to uprooting trade-off with on-page cost (digging soil, tearing iron roots).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from shell's brittle relic to cracking cheer, reweighting mechanical decay via music's bridge from knowing to understanding. Final image ("violin weeping triumph") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Recurring gap motif shifts from longing to bridged divide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (rhythmic, resonant noticing: "ba-dum" pulse, whirring gears). Voice texture modulates from soft whispers to swelling/louder rhythm under pressure, purposeful for musicality. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits enchanted idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in climax ("iron roots tore free, gears clattering"), but repetitive "gap between knowing and understanding" (4x) and "resonantly soft" (3x) border paraphrase-loop artifact, dulling momentum slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin heart-signals awakening policed orchard transforms fantasy tropes via grounded pulse mechanics and shell talisman. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically; Tarnished wonder premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
