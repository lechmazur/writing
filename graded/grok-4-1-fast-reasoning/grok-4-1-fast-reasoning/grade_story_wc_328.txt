<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's bitterness is embodied concretely (tears freeze on cheeks), driving micro-choices like clutching the arrowhead, with internal conflict peaking in her whispered confession. Change feels earned via brother's voice, but resolution tips tidy with minimal contradictory impulses in the final ascent. Brother and Mira apply secondary pressure effectively at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (arrowhead to phone) build density to RR closure (metamorphosis with cost of shedding grief, legible in "bitterness transmuted"). Orientation anchored early (underground garden post-Change). Pivotal inciting (unearthing arrowhead) causally leads to climax without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's bioluminescent herbs and quartz veins constrain wandering and charge final blooming ascent; frost mirrors thawing internal state. Sensory details (rime crackle, dew tasting of pine) selective via researcher POV, evolving with gravity play. Recurring garden/fern elements reweight closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim hope from bitterness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via confessions deepening knowledge of "cosmic prank." Agency in Elara's whisper forecloses grounded grief with legible cost (body lightening). Escalation coherent under lens to Charged Poise at ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness as cosmic joke emerges organically from confessions and metamorphosis, with final soaring image resonating non-literally (arrowhead as badge recharges prior void). Subtext in playful gravity avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in wild indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cryptid lens on glowing ferns, warped gravity). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, diction biased to sylvan whimsy. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("See? Gravity's got a sense of humor") advances closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but overwriting in climax (figurative density like "static weaving like spider silk" across confessions) muddles slightly without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops ("cosmic joke" echoes). Rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax purposeful. Closure image clear despite peak slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Change cryptids, static confessions via old phone, and gravity whimsy transforms tropes organically. Arrowhead-phone discovery feels inevitable in hindsight; risk in playful physics heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
