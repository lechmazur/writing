<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Personality borrowing creates embodied contradiction in the fear swap ("drowning in her dread"), compelling higher-stakes release; flaws like overconfidence amplify loop without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds to CR closure ("transposed empathy was the ultimate equation") with conceptual cost in fragment's dimming and new star's flicker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Topaz walls amplify starlight, constraining press work and charging final "topaz gleamed eternally" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Feedback loop tightens stakes via agency (grabbing fragment), with legible cost in "searing transposed pains" reweighting math quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final "new star flickered—emotion's rebirth" offers non-literal resonant answer to math-of-emotion question, reweighting ambiguity without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cryptic perceptual signature ("joy equaled sorrow's derivative") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation under stress stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in "lucid turbulence" peak slightly clouds but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Letterpress-empathy-math synthesis transforms fantasy tropes organically; feedback loop turn feels inevitable from early ambiguity setup.</comment>
