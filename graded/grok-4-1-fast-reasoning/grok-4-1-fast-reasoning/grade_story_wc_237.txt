<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transform scars pulses through embodied flaws like crystallizing arms weighing her down, compelling micro-choices like quill-tracing; contradictory doubt surges against ritual rhythm, earning the final binding of scars into "Legacy's Breath" with felt lung-ache cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as quill dips and sigils accumulate shedding flakes, tightening to charged poise in the final rune where time rushes forward post-exhale; on-page cost legible in "lungs ached" and prior pain-lancing, with platform descent reconfiguring exile stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating platform's runes glow awakening to quill-intent, constraining rite via suspension and stone-taps; recurring matcha as ink and tea charges final sip's triumph, mirroring internal hush against external storms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of guild exile tightens accumulatively as crystals bloom heavier, forcing quill-revisit; agency in sigil-tracing narrows to legacy-binding with unmistakable pain and breath-cost charging the exhale rush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scars-as-chapters theme emerges implicitly via holographic vignettes narrating failures, reweighted in constellation-threads; final "portals" image offers non-literal answer to pain-into-legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rune-scholar signature—sigils "flowing like suspended rain"—modulates rhythmically under stress, stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias to scars/crystals; purposeful compression taught early pays off in hush-cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "steam that curled like forgotten sigils"; figurative pattern (prismatic shards, luminous flakes) coherent without muddle, though peak shedding dense—varied rhythm sustains ear-test through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes tea-rite with crow-quill superstition into rune-transformation on storm-suspended platform, inevitable hindsight via childhood faith bridging to "scars now stories"; bold risk in timeframe-pause heightens without gimmick.</comment>
