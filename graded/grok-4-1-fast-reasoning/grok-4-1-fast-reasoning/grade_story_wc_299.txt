<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trembling hands and loupe mantra embodying roadie grit vs. appraiser precision; confidently uncertain trait motivates appraisal micro-choice under loss pressure. Final stance shift to memorial earned by scrap trigger without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fact density (weave, dating) accumulates to Charged Poise closure in pocketting scraps and truck departure; legible before/after reconfiguration with emotional cost of leaving trailer. Orientation anchored early in trailer/quarry; one tightening via duplicate scrap suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trailer dust and pit blasts as recurring micro-setting constrain isolation, mirroring "feedback whine" to charge final descent; body/tools like loupe/scraps filter through appraiser bias, evolving causally with blasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Loss-to-purpose stake signaled early, deepened accumulatively by scrap provenance narrowing options to memorial action; agency in appraisal/sketch forecloses hiding with resolve cost felt in trailer exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging echoes emerges via scrap bridge, culminating in "After the applause, life played on" as non-literal resonant answer reweighting loss without moralizing; particulars like intertwined weaves avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in cable-knot simile and fact rhythms; voice modulates from hollow ache to "purpose hummed anew," consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated blasts/scrap handling; minor "echoes/wrest" paraphrase loops (-0.4) do not obscure closure image of unspooling road.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ex-roadie appraiser in quarry transforms relic trope into fact-vs-heart synthesis; fresh scrap provenance arc risks quiet Charged Poise over roar, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
