<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "weathered resolve" intensifies through centuries of persistence, compelling the final forehead press; interiority concrete in pulse syncing with breath. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong, not exceptional; endurance earns closure change with body cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stone skips build density to colossal flock pattern break, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure as mind roams unbound, body stilled in final image with eternal cost legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain skimming arcs and amplify harmonies, charging final dusk image; dust layers evolve causally, mirroring internal weathering. Sensory hierarchy (clack-clack, hum, wings slicing grit) selective via Thren's priorities. Exceptional micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise arrowhead for navigation knowledge) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via denser flocks over time, narrowing to final perfect skim forcing payoff. Agency in honed throws; cost unmistakable in body stilled for mind's roam. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent reverence yielding unbound essence emerges from particulars like spirals mirrored in flock; final image reconfigures time's layering without moralizing. Resonance from pulse reunion reweights shaman's loss and Thren's stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (dust as "patient memory," echoes as "sighs") modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, no elision. Prose texture reflects Thren's timeless resolve without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short clack-clack amid long weathering sentences); purposeful repetition (layered dust) taught early, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in flocks "like smoke" integrated without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic stone-skipping via birds over centuries transforms relic-hunt trope; risk in extreme timeframe heightens stakes organically. Final unbound roam inevitable from established vigil.</comment>
