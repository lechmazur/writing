<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's polished calm trait roots motivation and earns endurance at closure, with Raoul and thugs providing crucible pressure; internal conflict emerges mildly in legacy ghosts versus startup vision. Flaw: contradictory impulses mostly summarized, not acting simultaneously in pivotal dissuasion scenes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in rise/fall shards and CR closure ("discovered the truth... forged enduring harmony") with legible cost (startup crumbles). Mosaic shards (Track B) taught early with legible transitions; orientation anchored in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train setting vividly selective and purposeful, with hoops/markers constraining choices (dissuasion) and charging final image (eternal outpost); dusk/stormy patter mirrors internal states through action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's calm priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform/guard legacy into startup) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via investor push and thug intrusion tightening to endurance; Raoul/thug scenes force trade-offs with on-page cost (intruders falter, but startup later crumbles).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of circling paths/calm guardianship emerges organically from hoops/markers/events, resonating in CR final image without moralizing. Weakness: closing lines border thematic echo ("polished calm... enduring harmony"), slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (calm light/shadow noting); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Paths circle back"). Repetitive "dusky harmony" phrasing mildly disrupts rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting with repetitive descriptors ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony," "territorial markers") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across descriptions; figurative density dulls climax (thug scene summary). Read-aloud rhythm varies but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber legacy, circus train vault, currency art startup transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in poetic mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via circling motif.</comment>
