<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in foresight cultivation drives micro-choices like anemometer placement and mask donning; embodied adaptation (senses tuning to gusts) reveals character under pressure. Patch inheritance earns a meaningful change with felt vigilance cost. Minimal internal contradiction limits to strong but not exceptional; no therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as data layers build to CR closure: transmission reconfigures labyrinth from maze to map with conceptual cost of ignored wind shear. Orientation anchored early (Elias in port stacks post-crash). Single continuous scene fits defaults; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain choices (narrow alleys force recalibration, stack climb risks wind shear) and charge final image (haze sharpens adapted gaze). Sensory hierarchy (wind whispers, dust devils) reflects investigator bias. Environment evolves with action, mirroring internal mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map winds to foresee chaos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening data at crater tying vectors to black-box. Agency in survey forecloses ignorance path with vigilance cost. One tightening suffices; no reversals needed for lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation vs. convergence emerges organically from wind funnels and patch reprise, reweighting premise in final transmission without moralizing. Patch shifts from talisman to badge, charging closure image. Complexity in AI failure vs. human vigilance avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (haze as lens for precision); diction modulates with intensity (short logs amid howls). No dialogue or head-hopping. Voice texture distinct in wind-channeled rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("rapidly adapting," "singular convergence") create template cadence across beats, dulling density without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops (wind patterns restated). Rhythm varies but figurative haze/wind overuse borders overwriting in peak crater beat. Propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind micro-bursts as drone-herder in container maze transforms disaster trope via specific anemometer data and patch. Risk in quiet CR closure (foresight sown amid silence) heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
