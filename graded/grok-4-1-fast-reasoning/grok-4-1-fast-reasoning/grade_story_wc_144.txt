<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's blind intuition drives consistent, trait-rooted motivation, shown through touch/sound oversight and passion for machines' stories; micro-choices like directing water immersion reveal values. Limited internal contradiction or contradictory impulses in scene caps from 9+; competence dominates without much struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chain rattle incites urgency, vibrations decode turbulence leading to refraction exam and patch (because/therefore). On-page DC closure in drone's steady hum/test flight with time cost legible as anchor groan; orientation anchored early in depot/shop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist depot, lanterns/basins constrain repair via refraction, mirroring Elias's fog-piercing mastery; sensory hierarchy (sound/vibration over sight) biases to blind POV. Recurring chain clanks evolve with pressure; final depot vigil charges image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone repair before departure) signaled early, tightens causally via flaw discoveries narrowing options; agency in Elias's commands/patch forecloses failure path. Escalation peaks at chain crescendo, cost felt in urgency but no deeper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of intuitive renewal emerges organically from blind decoding/repair, reweighted in "his own decoded truth" without stating moral. Final shop vigil as beacon offers resonant CR on guidance amid departing pull; avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with blind perceptual signature (vibrations/voice/refractions via others); voice modulates rhythmically, poetic diction fits artisan calm. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, distance tightens at touch/patch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figuration ("prismatic rainbows... spectral fingers") in repair beats borders overwriting (-0.4), but purposeful for refraction; minor paraphrase on "calm" ("magnetic calm" repeats). Propulsion strong, syntax varies; no loops obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh blind artisan decoding drone hums via water refraction transforms repair trope; risk in non-visual mastery heightens stakes organically. Synthesis of steampunk elements feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
