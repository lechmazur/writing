<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief ("pain clawing her ribs") and micro-choices in naming drive motivation, earning change from heartbroken to strengthened; minor slip in tidy end-epiphany ("heartbroken no more") slightly abstracts cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via successive recordings/namings to Charged Poise closure ("fears crystallized into allies"); cost legible in "touching the crystallized page, feeling Lirian's warmth trapped within."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's oculus and scattered light constrain method and charge final image, with sensory details (echoes amplified by dome, pulsing ink) mirroring internal shift; selective, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) tightens via each crystallization narrowing nameless terror, with tears as felt cost accelerating final Vorath; agency in channeling essence forecloses grief's veil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice's echo conquering fears emerges organically through naming acts, resonant in final scythe-lift reweighting loss as strength without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias on echoes/light/grief; rhythmic lyricism modulates intensity, distinct texture in reaper's lens ("whisper in the ether").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but motif repetition ("echo of sacrifice," "scattered light") borders paraphrase loop in naming sequence, slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper naming ink-monsters via recordings/light transforms grief tropes; bold risk in accumulative crystallization feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
