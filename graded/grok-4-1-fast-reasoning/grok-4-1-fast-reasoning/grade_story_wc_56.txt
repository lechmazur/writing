<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to grasp "architecture of lies" compels salvage amid mud risks, earning pivot to "no longer errant" via dual sundials; interiority concrete through ripple-reading instincts, though reflective phrasing borders on diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via motif density to CR closure—"hindsight clarity flooded him" reweights myths as "salvageable truths" with cost of past quest failures legible in sundial inscription; single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening at wreck discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight canal's mudflats and eddying currents constrain salvage choices, charging final dual-sundial image; sensory hierarchy (ripples, ooze slurp) filters via Elias's instincts, evolving causally with deepening shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of myth-truth pursuit tightens accumulatively through wreck salvage narrowing options (shifting mud risks); agency in poling/probing yields felt cost of prior "failures stemmed from ignoring such submerged scaffolds," charging poised realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of lies as temporal scaffolds emerges via sundial shadows and inscription without statement; final barge onward reconfigures errant pursuit non-literally, resonating with salvage particulars over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (shadows as anomalies, water lapping) modulates rhythm with intensity; voice texture poetic yet consistent, diction biased toward watery guile without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive motifs ("serene upheaval" x3, "by training instincts" formula x3) create paraphrase loops and template cadence in reflective beats, dulling propulsion; overwriting density (e.g., "mist clung... like unspoken regrets") mixes metaphors without pattern payoff, though syntax varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sundial twins decoding lies via shadows transforms legend-seeking trope organically; risk in poetic waterway immersion heightens stakes, fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight pivot.</comment>
