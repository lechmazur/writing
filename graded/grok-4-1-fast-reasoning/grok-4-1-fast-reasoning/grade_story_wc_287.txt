<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's wistfully pragmatic trait shows in contradictory impulses: lingering on the rose stem yet descending to act, earning Mira's handoff. Mira's vulnerability peels via micro-choices like flinching then leaning in. Minor slip in overt "wistfully pragmatic in her smile" label-speak slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: petal drop seeds pattern of endings/renewal, density builds via rowing cadence to Charged Poise closure in Mira's resolve and Elara's pruning. Orientation anchors early (fire escape to harbor). Cost legible in "roots must yield to frost" reconfiguring light's persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and rosebush constrain choices: petal drop prompts descent, gauge tests knot, boat enables rhythmic instilling. Final pruning charges image, mirroring internal renewal. Sensory hierarchy (moonlight diamonds, oar splash) selective via gardener's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reflect light into dark corners) signaled early, tightens via Mira's confession and tooth handoff under accumulative lens. Agency in rowing/words forecloses isolation with emotional cost in tears and yielding rose. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through measurement emerges via gauge tooth shifting from lock-testing to soul-gauging, reweighting petal loss in final pruning image. Subtext in silences and implications avoids morals. Minor echo in "pragmatism whispers to water roots" borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with gardener's perceptual signature: rust-to-nectar, petals twirling. Voice rhythms modulate with oars (splash-lift). Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Row with me?"). No head-hopping, diction biased to blooms/light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via oar cadence mirroring sentences, high density in integrated metaphors. Minor overwriting: dense figures like "waves stilled mid-whisper" in hush repeats slightly muddle peak boat beat. No loops, scaffold clean; propulsion holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith gauge as hope talisman transforms via gardener's renewal motif, rowing rhythm uniquely instills resilience. Bold lyric accumulative frame risks poeticism but coheres. No template tropes; petal-gauge-harbor inflections inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
