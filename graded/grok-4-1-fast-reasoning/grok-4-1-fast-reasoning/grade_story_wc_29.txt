<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit tricksters intensifies through micro-choices like the demo to Harlan, earning her decisive broadcast with embodied hope vs. encroaching dark. Harlan applies immediate pressure as opportunist. Repetition of "cautiously hopeful" as label slightly undercuts particularity in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal intercept therefore plan, Harlan intrusion therefore demo/broadcast DC disrupting divide. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure on-page with rust-taste cost ("victory tasted of rust") and vigilant poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's console, transmitter, and charts constrain choices (patching laptop, flipping switch) and charge final sentinel image. Sensory grit (hum, shouts, solder tang) filters through Elara's priorities. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit tricksters) tightens via Harlan intrusion narrowing options to demo under pressure. Agency in interference forecloses divide with on-page cost (imperfect win, lurking threat). Causal escalation coheres to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance amid chaos emerges from interference turning tricksters' method, reweighted in final vow without moralizing. Subtext in gritty stars vs. utopia promises invites ambiguity on eternal watch. Final image answers hope's fragile endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmic grit bias); voice modulates rhythm in stress (short sentences at broadcast). Dialogue goal-driven: Harlan's growl pursues control, Elara's "Listen" seizes moment. No head-hopping; diction cosmic-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels but "cautiously hopeful" repeats (6x) and "ethereal grit" loops create template cadence, mildly dulling closure vigilance beat. Rhythm varies; metaphors coherent (pulsar jam). Minor scaffold in ending divides-softening paraphrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of SETI subsonics and inverted pulsar interference transforms trickster tropes via charts' specificity. Risk in gritty cosmic voice heightens stakes without gimmick. Turn at demo feels earned from prior decoding.</comment>
