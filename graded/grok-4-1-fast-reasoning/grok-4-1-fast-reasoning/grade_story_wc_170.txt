<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in beloved's despair drives consistent traits and renewal ritual; strength in actions revealing values under fragile existence pressure. Weakness: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, serenity dominates without embodied conflict at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as borrowed heartbeats density-build to CR closure: mirrors reconfigured with conceptual cost of innocence infusion, Elowen dissolving into elusiveness. Orientation anchored early ("echoing terrace in spring"); single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains painting/singing and charges final glow image, rain droplets refracting light filter perceptions purposefully. Sensory details (rain-kissed stone, distant coos) selective via Elowen's priorities, evolving with action to mirror internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heartbeat renewal to alter mirrors) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via threaded heartbeats gathering to final lullaby tightening. Cost legible in fragile form sustained yet dissolving; agency in ritual drives under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities infusing rigid reality emerges organically from mirage-painting and innocence-borrowing, final image resonating as mirrors hum with potentials. Subtext in ethical ambiguity of theft-like borrowing avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (light quivers, vapor trails), stable single-POV distance modulates serenely; rhythmic poetic syntax fits accumulative tone without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting flaw dominates: figurative density ("petals unfurling like whispered secrets") in every high-pressure beat without pattern payoff obscures propulsion (-0.7); repetitive phrasing ("perceptively calm" x3, "grace" x4, "dusky harmony" x3) creates template cadence and paraphrase loops (-0.8), dulling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise of heartbeat-borrowing mirage painter transforming mirrors via children's dreams feels inevitable synthesis; risk in lyrical fantasy execution heightens stakes organically (+0.3), no derivative echoes.</comment>
