<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's callused hands and tree obsession root motivation in embodied curiosity, driving micro-choices like dream-mapping; final smile earns realization without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream-deconstructions build density to pin-drop CR, reweighting sorrow with conceptual cost in tree-rings image; early pattern anchors orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonlight healing constrains workbench and corridor repairs, charging oaks' sap-starlight in closure; selective storm/moonglow filters Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to uncover trees' witness tightens accumulatively through escalating numbers (47 to 3,204), forcing agency in final shard; dilution cost viscerally reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sorrow deconstructed into rooted growth offers resonant answer to cosmic indifference via tree vision, emerging organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward sentinel oaks and whispering doors; stable close-third modulates rhythm with storm breaths, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax syncing storm flashes; figurative layering (grieving limbs, quantified echoes) purposeful, though repair-beat density nears overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sextant-dreams-trees synthesis transforms quantified grief into arboreal sextant, risking lyric fantasy for mundane miracle with inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
