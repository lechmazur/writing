<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Daughter's shadow-sleep anchors motivation that intensifies to compel the tether action; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under covenant pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with insight ("mending what isn't torn") linking to tether action and DC closure as melody erupts transmuting shadow to light with tear-cost legible in final lines; orientation anchored early in chamber and twilight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains repair via amplification and guides choices (tether hums with vibration); sensory hierarchy (sound primacy) charges final crescendo image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light) signaled early tightens texturally via frequency clash to agency-driven crescendo under causal lens; cost felt in prior loss and tears as midnight recoils.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth defeating shadow emerges organically through rust covenant and flower integrity, reweighted in closure's golden light without moralizing; final image resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (sound-as-heartbeat, light-as-fire); rhythmic poetic texture modulates to climax intensity, but elevated diction borders register drift in peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure climax (most sentences layered metaphors like "gears kissed" amid cascades) dulling propulsion (-0.7); minor "tinkersong" loops and synonym churn (balance, light reclaim) add scaffold (-0.4).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical music box and rust-truth pact transforms tinker tropes via covenant logic; risk in lyric fantasy heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
