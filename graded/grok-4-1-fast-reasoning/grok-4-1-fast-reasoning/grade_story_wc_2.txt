<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between rigid planning and urge to improvise, embodied in fingers hovering over timepiece; earned change at journals where certainties crumble. Minor slips in stock phrasing like "heart raced" slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of coincidences tightening to compass discovery and journal revelation; CR closure legible in "weight of his old certainties crumble like ash," felt conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchored early in workshop by waterfall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices vividly—waterfall veils fissure, vines block path with swirling leaves, ashes hide chest—charging final retracing image; sensory hierarchy (roar drowns ticking) POV-specific to tinkerer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to embrace uncertainty signaled early, escalates via density of discoveries under Accumulative lens, agency in improvisations narrowing rigid options; cost felt in crumbling certainties at journals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from coincidences and journals; resonant CR in final image of clocks "fixable in new, unplanned ways" reweights premise. Journals' quote borders thematic echo but integrates via discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature—mechanisms, gears as uncertainty metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from meticulous to liberated, as in "whispering to himself that befriending uncertainty meant trusting the twist."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "mist hung like forgotten thoughts") taught early without muddle; no loops, propulsion peaks at chest opening "popping the lock with a satisfying click."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-treasure motif into philosophical uncertainty quest, transformed by compass rose's "Doubt's Drift"; risk in lyrical cavern choreography heightens stakes organically.</comment>
