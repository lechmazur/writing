<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in witnessed bleaching intensifies through embodied tapping and micro-choices like prying lockers, earning closure resolution; interiority concrete without stock phrasing. Knuckles stilled at revelation shows contradictory endurance with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from taps to hologram stabilization, yielding on-page CR ("delayed revelation crested... metamorphosis") with conceptual cost of past inertia reweighted. Orientation anchored early (station, 2047); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (swells groaning, sensors ticking) constrains choices (salvaged projectors, core samples); station/recurring buoy field charges final "horizons reborn" image, mirroring internal flux.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, deepens via assembly anomalies under accumulative lens; agency in wiring/taps forecloses aimlessness with exhaustion cost ("hours blurred").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-metamorphosis emerges organically from reef surveys and hologram; final "paths awaited rediscovery" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (wave-synced noticing); rhythmic prose ("taps encoded... pulse") modulates purposefully, distinct texture enhances accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, minor overwriting in metaphors ("blue ghosts," "rogue wave") purposeful and pattern-taught without muddling closure; no loops or scaffolds obscure revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban eco-regeneration via reefs/gyres transforms climate tropes; tapping-as-mnemonic and path-metaphor feel inevitable, risking lyric accumulation for charged CR.</comment>
