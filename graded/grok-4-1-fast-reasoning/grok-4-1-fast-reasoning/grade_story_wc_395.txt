<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files intensifies compellingly through her lie, with embodied tension in "Heart pounding in the sterile hum" driving the pivotal forgery. Contradictory impulses shine in her hesitation before lying, earning the job-losing closure choice. Flawless alignment of actions to traits avoids stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (2519 recurrences) builds to CR closure: "nothing truly vanished," with legible cost in job loss and local archive of patch. Single scene anchors orientation early ("corporate memory keeper for the Social Nexus Archive"); no shards or ambiguity. Causality tight from spotting anomaly to forged query triggering audit bot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Social Nexus Archive as micro-setting constrains choices via sealed vaults and audit bots, charging final "screen dimmed, songs echoing faintly." Sensory hierarchy (sterile hum, pixel glitches, echoing songs) reflects Elara's priorities without tourist catalog. Patch recurs constraining discovery and local save.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deleted files' fate tied to cold case) signaled early tightens via lie narrowing options, with audit bot forcing job-costly endurance. Accumulative escalation coheres as pattern density forces agency in forgery, visible price in "terminal locked" and "lie had cost her job."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of persistent echoes in absence emerges organically from 2519 pattern and Lena's log, reweighted in final CR: "2519 pulsed once more, a final song unsung." No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, with ambiguity in "sensed absence lifted, if only for her."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature in "laser sifting through the void" and rhythmic modulation under stress. Purposeful compression of elisions (crew posts) taught early pays off at revelation. No dialogue; diction fits archive-keeper lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy artifacts from bracketed word counts ("[412—no, recount properly]") and meta-loops ("trim back mentally, but proceed as is?") obscure mid-story causality and dull propulsion. Repetitive phrasing ("sensed absence," "echo") creates paraphrase churn across beats, stalling density in high-pressure discovery. Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs ("across the echo of forgotten songs") harms ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social archive ghosts and digitized minds from spaceship crash transforms digital-haunting trope via specific 2519 pattern and lie's cost. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; final "bridge to the deleted" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
