<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guarded nature shown through hesitation to yield flesh, cracking under visions of the elder; embodied pain and final unguarded soul earn change with cost. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in blood-pricking micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from seed-planting to plant-growth circles freeing the frozen confession (CR) with conceptual cost of fractured self. Orientation anchors immediately in vortex; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-kissed soil underwater and spiraling roots constrain planting and growth, charging final straightening trees; sensory hierarchy (humming air, groaning branches) reflects druid's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (face hidden truth) signaled early tightens via vortex squeeze and visions, forcing blood-tradeoff agency; cost legible in sharpened pain and raw truth under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-deceit emerges organically from seed ritual to confession thaw, final image ("unbinder of self-deceit") reweights mirrors' lie with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward runes/spirals; rhythmic diction ("warlike serenity") modulates pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor figurative density ("poised tranquility," "calm ferocity") in growth beat slightly overwrites without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-vortex ritual and seed-unbending transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking in sustained "warlike serenity" pattern heightens thematic stakes inevitably.</comment>
