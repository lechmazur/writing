<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's jittery traits embodied in twitching fingers steadying with purpose, motivation to coax wonder intensifies via pendant's hum driving offer to Lira; earned change from routine to myth-verse in final reflection. Lira applies relational pressure, revealing her weariness through visions. Minor unembodied epiphany phrasing like "wonder germinated like seeds" slightly abstracts closure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of aurora-memory-vibration builds to CR closure where "Thorne's absence? A seed, long germinated" reconfigures legacy with conceptual cost of routine's fade. Single scene oriented immediately (ridgeway, courier). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in Kael's lighter steps foreclosing jittery void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain choices (fork pause, offering) and charge final image ("auroras etching their path into legend"); sensory hierarchy via Kael's pulse-sync sharpens visions. Details tactile (wind hunch, wing membrane), mirroring internal shift without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax wonder from routine) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at vibration peak syncing heartbeats, narrowing to germinated change; agency in relic offer forecloses Lira's drudgery with felt relational cost. Escalation driven by pendant's hum complicating routine exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder germinating from routine/myth from memory emerges via pendant visions and final CR image ("Kael... became the myth's next verse"), reweighting prior tapestry without moralizing; subtext in shared reveries invites ambiguity of Thorne's reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (auroras as "captured sky fragment," syncing reveries) stable in third-limited POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Relic for your forge?"). Rhythmic modulation heightens vibration peak without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (vibrate/germinate as textural motif) propels accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops ("wonder germinated... seeds in thawed soil"; repeated "fade") dull two mid-beats. Rhythms vary read-aloud; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sympathetic vibration extends encounters, transforming absent-mentor trope into lineage-seed CR; ridge-dragonfly relic and aurora-sync risk bold lyric magic without gimmick, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
