<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in husband's rose engraving mirrors stencil and drives all micro-choices like adapting tools to origami; embodied tears and callused hands show contradiction of withered soul igniting. Final vow and persistent work earn change with felt cost of endless infinities. Minor abstract epiphanies like "grandest truth" slightly unearned but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of crafting/placing origami parts successive curtains, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as final lotus parts grandest veil and nebula births with conceptual cost of infinities ahead. Orientation anchored by ~100 words in mist/observatory entry. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "etching revival across the void."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's brass telescopes, orreries, and obsidian domes constrain choices (perch cranes on eyepieces, nest in gears) and charge final image of thrumming sanctuary. Sensory hierarchy via jeweler's tactile tracing; details evolve with revival (stars greening). Micro-setting of vellum/lectern anchors inciting incident.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive withering stars/self) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via first curtain stir to spectacular cluster bloom, forcing endurance with cost of blurring nights and tears. Agency in ritual lantern and placements; moral calculus of husband's memory vs. oblivion. One deepening suffices, charges closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intention transmuting mourning to renewal emerges from particulars like wilted rose to blooming plasma; final nebula image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "subdued ardor" motif layers complexity. No tidy binary; ambiguity in endless curtains lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with jeweler-biased perceptual signature (filigree hands on relics, folding pendants into cranes); rhythmic prose modulates from numb despair to dancing hands. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early holds to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pierced coordinates... shaped origami" advances plot/character); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("withering flames... apathy") during peak revival, but patterned cosmic/jewelry weave avoids muddle; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jeweler's filigree to cosmic origami talismans transforms grief tropes; genuinely artificial stencil enables non-obvious revival logic. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via timeless blur, inevitable in hindsight at "forged eternity's jewelry."</comment>
