<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past shouts vs. present tenderness compels vial use, with embodied conflict (trembling hand, pounding heart). Micro-choices like uncorking reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: "screaming tenderness" borders on label-speak without full contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure—Mira's return reconfigures stakes, past scars as felt cost legible in "scars faded." Single scene oriented early (lighthouse summit post-heatwave). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency: jasmine scent as carrier wave constrains beckoning tactic, garden pulses in sympathy. Lighthouse lee hides garden, cobalt paint charges reunion beam. Body/tool (vial) integrates as micro-setting for final recork.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers via purified vibrations) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via uncork/whisper/wait to Mira's climb. Agency in vial use forecloses shout-path with relational cost visible in her wonder. Tightening reweights options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (subtlety > force) emerges from vial's purification and reunion image, reweighting shouts/whispers without statement. Final embrace answers question non-literally, scars' fade as conceptual cost. No moralizing, ambiguity in magic lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (tenderness as vibration). Voice texture modulates rhythmically, scent diction character-specific. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You... whispered?"), advances closure without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak wait ("pink fingers... stroked," "ripple finer than sea foam") without pattern payoff, muddling clarity in high-pressure beat (−0.6). Minor paraphrase loops on shouts/whispers. Rhythm varies but synonym churn ("screaming tenderness" x2) drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vial cork's rune magic transforms lighthouse trope into fresh vibrations premise, cork recorked as ingenious talisman. Risky magical realism synthesizes organically, no template echoes. Transformation test passes: swaps break logic.</comment>
