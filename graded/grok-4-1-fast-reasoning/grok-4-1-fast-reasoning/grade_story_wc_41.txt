<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via tidal longing and micro-choices like chalking runes under fading visions; precognitive forgetfulness constrains actions with visible cost in dissolving flashes. Final endurance of ongoing visions feels earned. Minor abstraction in some interior phrasing slightly detaches peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of visions and sound building to RR closure at tape playback, where chalk-anchored capture reconfigures longing into certainty with conceptual cost of impermanence ("new visions flickered, already fading"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via nexus arrival suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-veiled paths and driftwood constrain navigation choices; sculptures like "VCR giant" mirror internal decay and charge final amphitheater image. Sensory hierarchy (hums, rasps) reflects prophetic bias. Micro-setting (chalk on driftwood) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture sound) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of audible shifts and visions narrowing to nexus under Elias's agency. Cost legible in "trembling strokes" and snapping-chalk flash. Minor abstractness in some pressure points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from echoing visions and captured decay; final tape loop ("growing older with every loop") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting prior longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prophetic perceptual signature (fractured reflections, bony crackles); lyric voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, diction biased toward tidal/echo motifs. Purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm; motifs like "tidal longing" taught early without loop excess. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity, but peak capture beat propels cleanly. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>鮮 premise of "sound of growing older" synthesized uniquely with junkyard aesthetics; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, transforming tropes into inevitable prophet's triumph-with-cost.</comment>
