<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silent vow and persistent traits drive concrete micro-choices like prying the halo fragment and humming, earning the closure renunciation with embodied cost in throat vibration; contradictory impulses subtle but present in fevered grace amid decay. Minor slip: mythic archetype edges toward one-note without deeper flaws complicating peak repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density building to CR closure in final workshop carving, where halo's pulse reconfigures silence with vow's felt opportunity cost; orientation anchors early in tracks/train entry. Single scene fits defaults; wrong turn incites without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oasis vines/spring constrain repairs, charging final dawn image; sensory hierarchy (mildew to misting hush) reflects carpenter's priorities, integrated via goal-directed action like chisel on pony. Recurrent bells/dew subtly mirror internal restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive carousels from silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment discovery forcing repair under bells' time, with agency in hum altering tactics; cost legible in foreclosed muteness during climax hum. Enters 8+ via trade-off but lacks overt reversal beyond deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silence-as-possibility emerges organically from particulars like fragment's hum and pony repair, resonant CR in pulsing halo reweighting decay without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in vow's cost. Final image answers thematic question non-literally via "wheels turned once more."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in silence/whimsy bias; rhythmic modulation peaks in hum's "wordless aria," diction purposeful without drift. No dialogue; elision of backstory anchors to present cues like tales as boy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motif recurrence (misting hush, chime) teaches pattern for textural lens but risks paraphrase loops in descriptive runs like "whispering gleam" echoes dulling propulsion; high density overall, rhythm varies, but overwriting in oasis entry ("vines cascaded... wildflowers nodded") hits −0.7 in high-pressure discovery. Zero scaffold at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Halo in mossy pony transforms abandoned circus trope via silence ethos, fresh synthesis in hum-powered restoration; risk in magical fragment pays off inevitably at dawn image without gimmick. Minor proximity to mythic wanderer but grounded in carpenter tools.</comment>
