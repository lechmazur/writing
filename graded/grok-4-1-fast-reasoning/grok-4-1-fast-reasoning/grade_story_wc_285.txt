<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to distill vows intensifies through embodied needle work and percolating memories, earning the final revelation; contradictory impulses surface in the haunting question amid serene trance. Interiority particular via ambient attunement, no stock phrasing. Passenger's minimal pressure mirrors without complicating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via rain's percolation and mending until gutters stop, yielding CR closure in "tapestry reborn—layers honored, yet essence laid bare" with cost of foreclosed complexities. Single scene anchored early, no orientation debt. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog, mist, ticking gutters, river pulse constrain timing and charge mending/closing; sensory hierarchy (plink over visuals) reflects attentive POV. Details evolve causally with rain's wane, mirroring internal distillation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill promise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening memories and unpicking layers to core vow revelation, narrowing tangled options. Agency in deliberate pulls yields charged poise at knotting, cost felt in "no more tangled oaths."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of essence over layers emerges organically from palimpsest mending and final image of straighter paths, reweighting prior vows without moralizing. Resonance in "spindrift peace distilled his soul's complexity," inviting ambiguity on duty's serenity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ambient whispers and sync'd pulses; rhythmic modulation heightens serenity under pressure. Lyrical diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plink, plink" advances time and calm); purposeful lyric repetition (percolate, ticking) taught early pays off at silence's bloom, minor template cadence in serenity phrases dings propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic coachman trope via tactile palimpsest mending and fog-distillation; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens closure image without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: generic heirloom swap breaks mending arc.</comment>
