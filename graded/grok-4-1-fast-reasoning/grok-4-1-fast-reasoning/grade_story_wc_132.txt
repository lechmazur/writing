<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to study plants via immersion drives consistent choices like brewing and sipping tea, with reluctance embodied in prickling skin and fragmented memories; internal conflict shows contradictory impulses peaking at "legs rooted tentatively." Repetitive labels like "circuitously sincere" dilute character-particular interiority without embodied cost in peak transformation beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds from tea-sipping warmth to hybrid form, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "Elias, plant-man eternal, whispered to storms" with legible conceptual cost of lost humanity; orientation anchors early in nursery and storm season.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mossy trellis after rain constrains choices by beckoning and syncing pulses during transformation, charging final image; sensory details like "droplet's prism" and "rain pelted anew" filter through Elias's observational bias, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of immersive study tightens accumulatively via prickling to rooting, forcing renunciation of humanity with agency in clinging to trellis; cost legibly felt in "reluctance peaked as human thoughts fragmented," charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-through-sacrifice emerges organically from transformation particulars, resonating in final "harmony bloomed" without moralizing; "circuitously sincere" repetitions echo prompt-thesis, triggering Thematic Echo penalty in multiple lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in verdant, looping observations like "green veins threading through flesh"; murmurs to wind carry subtext of yielding, but repetitive phrasing converges voice texture under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn in "reluctant," "circuitously sincere," "sustaining transformation," "releasing control," and "reconstruction" across ≥3 adjacent lines dull closure image; template cadence in transformation beats ("arms elongated... legs rooted... torso twisted") triggers -0.6; heavy artifacts in final third cap high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nursery-owner's obsession yielding plant-man hybrid transforms metamorphosis trope through storm-synced behaviors; risk in circuitous prose heightens verdant vigilance premise without gimmickry.</comment>
