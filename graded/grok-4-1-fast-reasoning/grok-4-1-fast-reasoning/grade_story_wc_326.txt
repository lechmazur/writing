<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's heartbeat counting embodies fear of oblivion, grounding her under pressure and driving defragmentation choices. Motivation to fetch wisdom from failure intensifies via ghost parallels, earning identity mend. Minor flaw: ghost's hubris told in memory flash without full embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from radio static to ink defragmentation, culminating in CR closure: "survival was no error, but a heartbeat's defiant song" reweights premise with felt cost of humility. Single scene coherent; orientation anchored in opening lines. No causality breaks; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opal veins pulsing and snow muffling constrain ink patterns and heartbeat sync, charging closure shard refraction. Sensory hierarchy (chill deepens, ink swirls) filters through Elara's priorities. Micro-setting (console, shard) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetch wisdom) signaled early, escalates via defragmentation deepening knowledge of shared failure, narrowing to renunciation of ghost-like fear. Agency in pouring ink forecloses error-identity with legible emotional cost at "I've no more beats to tally." One tightening suffices under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically via ink mirroring code/veins, reweighting Elara's bureaucratic death. Final shard image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Counter-reading (hubris cost) embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: heartbeat rhythm biases noticing. Lyrical diction ("snowflakes danced like forgotten stars") modulates consistently; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Why count heartbeats?"). No head-hopping; elision of ghost form taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short counts amid lengthening descriptions); density high, ink patterns doing image/causality work. Minor loop: "midnight solace" thrice without full pattern payoff dulls slightly. No artifacts in closure; metaphors coherent (nebulae, veins).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ink fractals defragment digital ghost, paralleling clerical error survival. Risky lyric compression heightens textural stakes; porcelain shard transforms trope into irreplaceable anchor. Non-obvious payoff inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
