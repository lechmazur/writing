<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove coincidences' meaning roots in consistent doubt and visions, intensifying via shard-sharpened retrocognition; contradictory impulses (doubt gnawing vs. fierce burn) act in scene through etching and aligning, earning closure's weeping release with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard discovery to vigil etchings to storm-climax ignition as RR/Charged Poise, with cost in sustained effort and doubt's foreclosing; orientation anchors Elara-tower-post-collapse by para 2; closure image of beacon pillar pierces with undeniable price paid in persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's glass hum and skylight lens constrain alignment choice, charging final surge; sensory selection (muted hum, storm drums, star paths) reflects Elara's mystic urgency, evolving causally (etched floors, conduits cold); shard as micro-setting mirrors internal doubt-to-proof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove meaning via rekindle) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shard-deepened visions narrowing doubt-options; storm eve forces endurance agency, cost legible in "nights blurred into vigil" and weeping blaze; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterned meaning emerges organically from vision-life alignments and star rite, reweighting coincidences via beacon's proof; final "thistle-blown hope" image answers central doubt non-literally, lingering ambiguity in ongoing vigil without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via fractured visions and star counsel selective to Elara's bias; rhythmic modulation heightens vigil pressure (short sentences at alignment); purposeful compression of nights taught early, legible at ignition payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (hum crescendo mirrors surge), high density in vision overlays; minor overwriting in climax figs ("fallen star's heart," "pillar piercing") risks muddle but pattern-taught via prism motif avoids loop penalties; no scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocog post-apoc with hush-shard rite transforms tropes via star-memory proof; risk in lyric compression heightens mystic stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early doubt-constraint; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
