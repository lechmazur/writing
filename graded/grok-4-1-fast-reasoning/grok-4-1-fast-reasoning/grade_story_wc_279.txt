<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical motivation drives precise micro-choices like placing the tile flake, earning the intervention; socially perceptive trait enables tension-reading but edges toward label-only at "ever socially perceptive." Contradictory impulses (playful creation amid sensed discord) act in scene, fulfilling 9+ test with visible fulfillment cost in ephemeral unity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns/whispers builds to CR closure via emergent hush reconfiguring ritual fractures, with legible cost in "mandalas destined to scatter" and final scattering image; orientation anchored early in grotto/unlearning; one tightening suffices as hush spreads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto acoustics/tile constrain choices (flake unearthed, words amplified); mist/sand charge final image (scattering evokes ephemerality); sensory hierarchy (echoes, glow) reflects Elara's priorities; details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning from mess) signaled early, tightens via clamor peak to hush under textural lens; Elara's agency in mandala interjection forecloses fracture path with relational cost (ephemeral unity); one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-from-mess emerges organically via mandala/hush patterns, not statement; final tile-whisper image offers non-literal resonant answer ("Meaning hides in the hush you create"), reweighting ritual premise with ambiguity of ephemerality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (chalk-dusted whimsy amid unease) stable in single POV; diction/rhythm modulate with pressure (frantic chants to hush); interjection dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("lilac unease" x3, "emergent") patterns tone but risks paraphrase loop in mid-build; figurative density coherent in low-pressure beats but borders overwriting near climax; propulsion strong overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual acoustics, sand mandala, tile-flake hush transforms unlearning trope; risk in lyric hush emergence heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from early patterns.</comment>
