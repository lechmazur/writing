<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (merrily melancholic laughter amid regrets and peril) act in scene; final alignment earned by persistent paddling under pressure with embodied cost in tears and muscle protest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of regrets and pole-navigation builds to Charged Poise closure with star-pole alignment; cost legible in "regrets receding like ebbing tide" after rogue swell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poles as recurring "terrestrial constellation" constrain navigation choices and charge final star alignment; kayak body and waves tactilely pressure actions throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heart-action alignment vs. regrets backlash) signaled early, deepens via swell broadside and pole-syncing; agency in endurance forecloses evasion with cost in flickering-to-steady faith.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final whisper "Heart leads; follow" resonantly reconfigures navigation theme from tools/regrets to internal pull without moralizing; star-pole image reweights prior failures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (nautical whimsy under stress: poles as "lifeline rosary"); rhythmic modulation via shanty humming and short peril sentences heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif repetition ("merrily melancholic," "flickering faith") taught early as pattern; minor figurative density in regrets beats slightly muddles peak swell without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poles-as-navigation synthesizes broken tools and heart-pull into fresh, inevitable method; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
