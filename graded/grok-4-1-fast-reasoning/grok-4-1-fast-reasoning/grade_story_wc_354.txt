<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via chess-filtered perception and embodied worry stone tracing; motivation rooted in exile and father's dent intensifies choices. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("beauty in the difficult dance") abstracts peak realization slightly. Final endurance of exile with hope earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silences build density to final reconfiguration ("covenant stirred... glimpsed"). Orientation anchored early ("Elias, the exiled chess tutor, trudged toward the magnetic nexus"). Charged Poise closure with legible cost ("exile unbroken") on monoliths' shudder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worry stone and chessboard as micro-settings constrain correlations ("pawn's shadow fell just so on the dented stone"); nexus hums and shadows filter through precise POV. Twilight evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Charges final image of humming promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend covenant) signaled early, escalates via accumulating correlations under Accumulative lens; final deepening ("aligning king to the dent's curve") narrows to fragile renewal. Agency in precise piece shifts; cost felt in "melancholy tugging" and looming phase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-struggle emerges organically from pawn sacrifices and silence translations; final image ("worry stone warm in hand") reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in partial mend invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with chess-perceptual signature ("each step measured like a knight's calculated leap"); rhythmic prose modulates from measured to humming intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion ("silence here was language, each pause a Morse"). Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("twilight bled purple... eclipsed covenant haunted") during buildup, but closure image clear and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess logic mending magnetic pact via silence; transforms exile trope through "pawn's sacrifice" guiding renewal. Risky Accumulative structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from early nexus-chess linkage.</comment>
