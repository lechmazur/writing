<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in aesthetic compulsion to dissolve boundaries via verse, embodied in "tremor of certainty" syncing with quartz pulse. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; certainty dominates without genuine internal struggle or flaws complicating choices at pivotal paraphrasing beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through successive paraphrases blurring boundaries, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("poet emerged transformed... boundaries forever permeable") with conceptual cost of surrendered sacredness legible in final image. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening at tremor peak narrows to traversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: quartz colonnade constrains choices by vibrating/resonating to verses, forming archway; frozen lake evolves causally (cracks, softens, thaws), charging final mirror image. Sensory hierarchy (hum, cool facets, steam wisps) filtered through poet's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (striding sacred boundaries) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via verse-driven dissolutions narrowing options; agency in paraphrasing forecloses division with transformation cost. Tightening at colonnade archway forces traversal without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of aesthetic dissolution freeing post-ban realms emerges organically from verse/events, not statement; final image ("world felt remade... hush deepened, pregnant with possibilities") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting sacred illusions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (shadows, hush, gleam); rhythmic control modulates from murmur to chorus, stable single POV. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring escalation; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("cloak woven from fleeting umbras... shadows stride") during early beats, but pattern-taught and legible without obscuring cause/effect or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic fantasy: verse-as-solvent for boundaries transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in accumulative lyric design heightens stakes, with "paraphrase the ancient ode... reshaping its words" as inevitable ingenuity charging closure.</comment>
