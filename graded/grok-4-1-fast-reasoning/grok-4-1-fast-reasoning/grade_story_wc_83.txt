<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shift from scarred survivor to sovereign earned via scars burning during awakening and crystal seal; embodied contradictions in thrilled scars' itch and jagged laugh compel high-stakes hunt. Minor abstract labels slightly dilute peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as overload sparks awakening → hunt → pool harvest in charged poise RR; breakers' "ten precious minutes" timeframe legibly costs delay, shaping closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Null-grav spindle's shimmer constrains pool discovery choice; crystal's glow as "sole light" and final pulse charges ending, with scorched earth view mirroring desolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest potential tightens via emitter perturbations to "readings spiked," forcing seal under humming breakers; agency in pressing crystal forecloses reset interruption with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Void-harvest theme emerges organically from rubble crystal to sealed "stolen might," culminating in "geode pulsed, her heart's echo" CR that reweights trauma without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with quantum-biased perception ("quantum foam ripples") modulates rhythm under stress; purposeful "intangibly tangible" motif taught early enhances texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in "virtual particles pregnant with power" propels without loops; minor "bleak exhilaration" echoes purposeful, though slight repetition nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perturbation theory fused with drone-trauma hunt yields fresh quantum-post-apoc synthesis; "phasing through barriers like a quantum specter" risks bold voice-heightened stakes inevitably.</comment>
