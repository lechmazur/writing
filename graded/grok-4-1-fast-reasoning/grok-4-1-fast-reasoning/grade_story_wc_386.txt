<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to salvage purity drives all micro-choices like coaxing threads and cross-threading cameos, embodied in callused fingers tracing the globe; internal consistency shines without contradiction, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak ritual delve for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cameo density builds knowledge of betrayal, tightening via cross-threading to unified vision; on-page closure as Decisive Change in salvaging locket with binding cost felt in "held firm, her whisperer's gift"; orientation anchored early in shrine/ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's ice prisms and candle flames constrain ritual (invocations hum walls, globe pulses), charging final image of starlight fade; sensory selection (fogged breath, viscous pool) filters through Elara's wreck-diver bias, mirroring purity quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage purity) signaled early escalates via deepening cameo analysis under accumulative lens, narrowing to mate's exposure; agency in commanding "Reveal" forecloses shattering risk with legible binding cost, though no live option explicitly traded pre-climax caps at high 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of purity enduring betrayal emerges organically from locket's gleam amid rot, reweighting cameos in final unified vision without moralizing; resonant non-literal close in "purity endured" ties to motivation, but ambiguity leans tidy for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (wreckage metaphors like "hull cracked like shattered vow") modulates rhythm for ritual intensity; stable single POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early fits accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density ("flecks of pure white—remnants... twisted into windows") in peak delve borders overwriting (-0.5), with "borrowed starlight" motif nearing loop but purposeful; strong propulsion and varied rhythm otherwise sustain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver ghost whisperer using dream cameos in melted globe transforms ghost ship trope; risk in lyric accumulative ritual heightens ingenuity, inevitable hindsight in locket salvage from betrayal map.</comment>
