<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ezar's frugality consistently motivates micro-choices like reusing stylus and scraps, culminating in the final lamp extinguishing as earned endurance. Interiority embodied via callused foot and heart quickening under pressure. No deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: schematic layers deepen density to rift's uncloaking as Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early in palace corridors. Closure costs legible in tile reset and thrifty murmur, foreclosing empirical isolation for cosmic binding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vines pulsing in sympathy and crystal dome constrain astronomical schematics, charging final palace conduit image. Sensory hierarchy astronomer-specific: alignments over gold. Gate-capped due to Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to seal covenant tightens via schematic deepenings under Accumulative lens, narrowing empirical doubt to mystical pact. Rebels glimpsed add situational pressure without resolving. Cost felt in frugal vow recitation amid teetering regimes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Empirical irony theme emerges organically from tile defying odds to rift paradox, reweighted in final thrifty devotion mirroring harmony. No moralizing; ambiguity in Unknown lingers purposefully. Final image answers covenant question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: thrifty, stellar-biased noticing. Prose texture modulates rhythmically, poetic diction voice-motivated for dusky tone. Gate-capped due to Q7.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("frugal," "dusky harmony," "reimagined," "schematics") and paraphrase redundancy dull density, especially in descriptive runs; overwriting with metaphors pervades peak rift beat (−1.2 total). Propulsion intact but artifacts touch closure image. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square cipher in reimagined Babylon transforms empirical-mystical tropes via frugal schematics. Tile-rift turn inevitable from particulars. Gate-capped due to Q7.</comment>
