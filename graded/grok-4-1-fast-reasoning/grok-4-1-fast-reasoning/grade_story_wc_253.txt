<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—grief coils heavily yet she narrates it away with blank detachment; final endurance of void with faint lightness earned via whittling choices, embodying moral ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build of shavings, petals, carvings; Charged Poise closure in talisman ties bouquet/wood with legible conceptual cost of ongoing ambiguous mercy, anchors clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turbines as recurring constraint underscore performance via throbbing hum/dirge, charge final image of shadowed farmhouses; tactile shavings/slip, bouquet dust integrate selectively through POV's narrowed grief lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lighten grief via performance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via turbine groan/slip/voice crack narrowing to feather-weight endurance; agency in mimed churn/whittle shows trade-off cost in void's persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remade lightness amid void emerges organically from whittle/narration vs. mandate's rot; final talisman image reweights hush/mercy ambiguity as resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of dramatic flair (e.g., "blade of fate") biased by performer's detachment; rhythmic prose modulates swell/crack under pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figural texture (shavings as "pale whispers/snow"); minor repetition of "blank-faced"/hum purposeful for accumulative drone, no loops dulling closure talisman image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-mandate void/performance/whittled turbines transforms dystopia into intimate endurance; risk in blank detachment amid grief heightens stakes, inevitable in talisman reconfiguration.</comment>
