<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's scheming motivation drives micro-choices like winding the box, earning Thorne's release; contradictory impulses peak in Thorne's silent convulsion versus exhaled dissolution, with embodied cost in cellular toll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening vibrations and memory probes; closure RR/CR lands cleanly in "resentment dissolving like mist," with legible cost in wasted grace; orientation anchored early in sanctuary intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of sanctuary and music box constrains violence/echoes and charges memories, mirroring turmoil; final stabilization recharges shifts; sensory hush and vibrations vivid, purposeful under POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing resentment signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deeper memories narrowing grace's return; agency in Elias's winding forces Thorne's confrontation with cost in armored isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resentment calcifying grace emerges organically from cellular replays; final image of dissolving mist offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting broken pin metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias toward scheming patience; rhythmic texture modulates with shifts, perceptual signature in silent projections; no head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, motif without loops; "shifting" recurrence pattern-taught early, propels via varied rhythm; no artifacts dull closure image of vanishing box.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory via broken pin transforms pacifist trope organically; risk in soundless flux heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in grace's restoration.</comment>
