<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find courage intensifies credibly through embodied doubt and memory of the leash pulling at her ankles; guides apply relational pressure via tales and adjustments. Internal conflict emerges in trembling resolve versus fear, with micro-choices like clutching the ticket revealing values. Minor slip: final realization of "her own, reflected back" borders on unearned epiphany without deeper prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs of mist, loops, and lullaby build density to CR closure at tidal pool stamping, reweighting inner courage with tears as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in ridgeway and twilight vigil. One tightening via indirect routes unraveling fears narrows to revelation; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and tidal pool constrain choices (brambles part, path spirals) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (waves' hum syncing breath) reflects Elara's bias. Details evolve causally from fog-shrouded loops to cleft overlook. Tidal pool mirror of courage elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused courage) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through path loops forcing endurance; agency in pressing on despite falters forecloses return to village. Cost legible in tears mingling with spray at climax. Guides complicate via wisdom, not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unchaining via indirect revelation emerges organically from path motifs shifting to internal essence; final pool image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in guides' tales enriches without abstraction; ambiguity in "endless journeys" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in wave-synced breath and fog-filtered sight; voice rhythmic, modulating from hush to chorus. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Direct paths bind tighter"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping; diction fits embodied lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short doubt beats, flowing path prose); density high, advancing via integrated motifs. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loops in "indirect routes" and "gently persistent" repeats, though pattern-taught; no closure dulling. Star blooming avoids generic tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leash allegory with heart-ferry guides and courage as tidal reflection transforms escape trope. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at overlook CR. No derivative templates; ridgeway loops feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
