<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to pen the verse drives exile and freedom; contradictory panic and focused observation under anchoring pressure earn the final choice to linger. Embodiment shines in "sweat beaded like pearls as tides surged internally," revealing skill and struggle. Minor abstraction in repeated "obsidian grace" slightly dilutes peak specificity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: speck inciting anchor accumulates via gap observations to verse revelation and reversal, enabling flight to inking closure (RR/DC). Orientation anchors early in garden/twilight. Cost legible in "elective exile complete... speck dissolved," foreclosing isolation with chosen bond.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden moss and stars constrain via heel-brushed speck and gap syntax, charging final ink image; sensory selection (dew-kissed tactile, stellar visual) reflects dancer's tidal bias. Balcony transition coherent, evolves garden echo in "roses paling to silver." Micro-object speck as setting indispensable to anchor/climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verse on skin) signaled early, tightens via anchor pinning her ("how to reach mortal skin when anchored?"); observation agency deepens to freedom under accumulative lens. Cost visible in internal tides/panic, alters tactics to gaps; closure trade-off in chosen lingering charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of exile forging enduring verse emerges via gaps/anchor particulars, reweighted in final "cosmos kissed the finite" image without moralizing. Subtext in nostalgia flood tensions purity vs. longing; resonance inextricable from Elara's arc, inviting ambiguity on tides' permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with dancer's perceptual signature (tidal sync, gap syntax); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, e.g., short panicked breaths amid anchor ("Panic flickered... refused to yield"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Elara?" extends forearm in hope). No head-hopping, compression purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; figurative pattern (cosmic/dance) taught early, coherent in peak "roots of silver light burrowed." Minor density slip in garden openers ("whispered... syncing... weaving") borders overwrite but no muddle or loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer, stellar gaps as verse-syntax, speck-to-ink transforms fantasy tropes organically; risk in lyric compression heightens cosmic/mortal tension. Turn via gaps feels inevitable from exile setup, no derivative echoes.</comment>
