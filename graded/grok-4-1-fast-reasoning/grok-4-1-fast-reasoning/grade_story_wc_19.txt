<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied claustrophobia drive micro-choices like draping the scarf despite vines mimicking bunker walls; motivation to hoard silences rebelliously intensifies credibly. Contradictory fear and resolve act simultaneously in the harvest beat. Minor diagnostic "claustrophobia clawed" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via inversion-harvest-weaver escape to Charged Poise closure: Elara descends with prize, phobia stretched thin but lingering as cost. Orientation anchors early (trellis, inversion wait). One tightening (gilded sprout discovery narrows to isolation tactic) suffices; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid xenial trellis constrains harvest (vines snag during gust, cradle like bunkers) and charges final sway image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (openness vs. crush). Inversion flips spatial choreography coherently, mirroring internal stretch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect gilded hush) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: inversion density peaks at weaver threat, forcing flight with collection risk as cost. Agency in scarf-limitation forecloses exposure path. Climax escape tests commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silences rebelling against enclosure emerges organically via doll-archive vs. bunkers; final "gilded forever" image reweights phobia without moralizing. Doll reprise shifts motif from vessel to shield. Complexity in partial father-share ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (tasting silences, fearing contraction); voice texture modulates lyrically under inversion stress. Purposeful "intangibly tangible" repetition taught early. Rhythmic control heightens hush savor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; purposeful "stretching contracted" motif avoids loops. Minor figural density in harvest ("honeyed velvet") risks overwrite but pattern-taught. No scaffold; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity-flipping trellis, silence flavors, xenial vines transforms collection trope into phobia crucible. Gilded hush payoff feels inevitable from inversion logic. Bold surreal risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
