<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in choral harmony trait drives bridge-building and speech; actions align consistently. Lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, as Elara succeeds competently without internal struggle. No real micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pulley action with weight pulls cable ("the weight plummeted... yanking the first steel cable"), leading to bridge and harmonized talks as RR closure. Orientation anchored early (Elara in tower peering at silos). One tightening via bridge completion forces stance shift at talks; cost felt in healed rifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constraints enable action: tower supplies weight and vantage ("lifted the heaviest cuckoo clock weight"), charges final image as talisman. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (choral hush, star-glint); multilingual prairie vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography coherent across fields and silos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unite via bridges/talks) signaled early, tightens causally at talks where grievances clash before harmonizing. Agency in Elara's speech forecloses division with relational cost legible ("disputes dissolving in the chorus"). Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unity from silos emerges organically via literal bridge and choral weaving; final image reconfigures divides non-literally ("woven voices"). Subtext in multilingual chorus avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars like weight talisman.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("hush of borrowed starlight"); diction modulates rhythmically. Multilingual dialogue natural, goal-driven ("¡Uníos, unite, єднайтеся!"). Minor register elevation fits choral librarian voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but repetitive phrasing ("vigorous tender," "starlight hush," "borrowed starlight") creates template cadence across sentences, dulling peak beats like bridge speech. Figurative density overwrites without mid-beat pattern payoff; no loops obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clock weight as pulley for literal silo bridges transforms division trope via choral librarian. Risky multilingual harmony and orrery projections feel inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
