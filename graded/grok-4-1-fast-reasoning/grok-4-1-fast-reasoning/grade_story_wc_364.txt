<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation from kin's loss compels climax weaving with embodied sweat and measured strikes; internal fire and scars reveal particularity, but minor telling in "meek no more in spirit" slightly dilutes earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silk-weaving density tightens from first pulsing shard to cluster harmony; RR closure in orchard emergence with felt toil and spent silk cost, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration—shaft drips, crystal hums, rubble veins—constrains choices via acoustics and resources; arches pressure stakes, charging final stirring stones image through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to coax resilience escalates via silk-binding deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to piecemeal awakenings; agency in deliberate oaths forecloses decay path with visible sweat cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bartered loss-to-resilience emerges organically from rubble weaving to blooming groves; final arch lift offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting confusion-to-understanding via azure images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in forge-tactile noticing; rhythmic diction modulates from haze whispers to humming defiance, dialogue rasped and subtextual without on-page issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but patterned "azure"/"deliberate" repetition borders template cadence in weaving beat (-0.6); no loops obscure causality, metaphors coherent yet overwrought in high-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of comet-silk awakening destabilized arches transforms fantasy tropes via specific planetary decay; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
