<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to map empathy onto action drives micro-choices like shadow-weaving and mirror-glimpse alignment, earning the resolution; anomaly trait faces direct challenge from wraith's taunt, revealing courageous endurance without safety-hedging. Minor label-speak in "calmly intuitive nature" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: parley accusation therefore Thorne's fragment placement and mirror-guided reconstitution yields DC closure with holographic map reconfiguring floe-orchard paths; cost legible in prior feud tension foreclosed by shared light. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vintage mirrors constrain pivotal choice by revealing empathic glimpses that enable reconstitution; lighthouse orchard and floes pressure stakes via encroaching chill/light theft, integrated through action. Sensory details like "aged brass and salt-rot" filter via Thorne's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feud to war) signaled early, escalates via wraith's dismissal narrowing options, Thorne's agency in glimpse-mapping tightens to reconstitution with visible cost in risked anomaly status. Coherent causal pressure forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy bridging divides emerges organically via mirrors' truths and orb's map, reweighting anomaly as strength; final image of balanced floes/orchard answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in shadow-light interplay; dialogue sparse but subtextual (wraith's hiss pursues accusation goal), voice rhythm modulates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "shadows knitting light"; minor overwriting in descriptive clusters slightly slows parley tension but no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard above ice floes with empathic mirrors transforms peacekeeper tropes; risk-taking in anomaly bridge heightens stakes organically.</comment>
