<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation tied to temporal affliction propel Elowen’s feral choices, with serene anger evolving to resolve via earned realization. Mira effectively pressures as confidante. Repeated "serene anger" phrasing borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ink patterns and visions densify to Conceptual Repricing closure: "he understood now, his consciously wild path a forge for time's secret," with conceptual cost of mundane evolutionary truth legible on-page. Single shard in void transitions legibly; orientation anchored early in encampment post-eclipse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment and ink fractals vividly constrain choices, evolving causally—wind currents shape patterns, tents stretch into "infinite echoes" charging void traversal and final image. Sensory hierarchy (visual azure, tactile ink) reflects tracker's wild bias. No white-room; micro-setting (drone, ink) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve time dilation via ink to retrieve Mira/answer) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vision deepening knowledge of "evolutionary echo." Agency in crushing drone forecloses hesitation with felt cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of crisis-attuned wildness emerges organically from ink alchemy mirroring temporal gift, reweighted in final "sharper... world" image without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's whisper invites ambiguity on wielding knowledge; earned via particulars, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single tight third-person POV, perceptual signature feral/wild ("raw pulse," "consciously wild instincts"). Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden: "Time's warp hides in ink's embrace." Rhythmic modulation heightens void pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in patterns' bloom, but overwriting with figurative density ("swirling mandalas... living runes") in every high-pressure sentence dulls some clarity; "serene anger" and "ephemeral patterns" loops (−0.6 total). Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation tracker, ink portal, evolutionary mysticism transforms tropes organically; ink's alchemical bridge to crisis attunement risks bold non-causal payoff, heightening stakes in void visions without gimmick.</comment>
