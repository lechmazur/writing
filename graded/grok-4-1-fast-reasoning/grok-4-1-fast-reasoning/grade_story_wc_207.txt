<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find where "explanations fail" roots consistently in her petrichor obsession, shown through eschewing ropes for scents; embodied via trembling fingers and thrumming veins. Internal conflict subtle in trusting intuition over logic, earning transformation. Minor epiphanic summary at "true collection was internal" slightly unearned, but closure choice paid by prior visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: psychometry visions and hinge pulls densify toward CR closure where petrichor floods veins, reweighting purpose with conceptual cost of "surrender." Orientation anchored early at factory archive. One tightening via hinges suffices; cost legible in "petrichor flooded her veins, granting communion."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid petrichor and "resonant hush" constrain choices (scents guide delve) and charge final vial uncorking. Lagoon's bioluminescent obsidian mirror and weeping limestone filter through Elara's sensory bias. Evolves causally from cliffs to chamber; micro-setting (compass, hinges) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("place where explanations fail") signaled early, escalates via vision-doom then hinge-deepening under textural lens, forcing pulls that narrow to surrender. Agency in initiating readings/pulls; cost felt in absorbed energies and eternal guardians. Leader's whisper crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mystery beyond logic emerges via hinged visions/particulars, final image of uncorked vial offering non-literal resonance reweighting factory life. Subtext in "truth hinges on surrender" earned through pulls, no moralizing. Counter-reading (quirk to purpose) lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with scent/perceptual signature ("petrichor heavy," "resonant hush"); rhythmic modulation in delve's blur to chamber pulse. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at ghost emergence. Leader's single line carries subtext without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("resonant hush," "petrichor") taught for tone but loops excessively (6+ hush instances create paraphrase churn, −0.8). Dense propulsion in hinge pulls, but overwriting in "visions hinged open like ancient doors" mixes metaphors slightly. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor-psychometry-hinges synthesize fresh into irreplaceable delve; "stone hinges—literal, moss-crusted levers" transforms trope elegantly. Risky lyric accumulation heightens mystery stakes organically (+0.3). No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
