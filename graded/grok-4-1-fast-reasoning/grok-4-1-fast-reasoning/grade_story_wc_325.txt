<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in phasing limbo where claustrophobia "raged in the ethereal squeeze, yet purpose held her," earning the final honoring choice with embodied cost; no stock epiphanies, traits shown through micro-choices like tracing flecks despite trembling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rappelling because of motivation therefore narrowing passage escalates to phasing enabled by codex, culminating in RR closure ("She'd returned, stood by them... Unremembered no longer") with legible phobia scar cost in final cliff collapse and sealing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting constrains throughout (belly to stone, ethereal squeeze); bioluminescent kelp and rusted consoles charge nexus phantoms, with "crashing hush" evolving causally from muffled echo to resonant close; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from antechamber to nexus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor unremembered despite phobia/tide) tightens causally via phase transition narrowing options, forcing protocol initiation with agency; cost unmistakable in "phobia a scar, but heart light" as tide surges below.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing digital ghosts emerges organically from cable pulses and codex mapping, reweighted in final "whispered their names" without moralizing; phantoms' plea subtly mirrors Elara's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with claustrophobic perceptual bias ("walls seemed to pulse closer"); phantom dialogue carries subtext ("stand with us") advancing closure; rhythmic modulation under stress via short, sensory bursts.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in peak phasing ("reality blurred, her body humming"); minor repetition of "crashing hush" and "gold flecks" taught as pattern charging tone/closure, but "heart hammering" cliché dulls one beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking phobia with sentient cable signals and quantum phasing transforms tropes; codex as EM tracker enables non-obvious nexus payoff, risking sci-fi logic fully committed through logs and pulses.</comment>
