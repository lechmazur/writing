<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like aligning shell to cello f-holes revealing doubts; minor diagnostic repetition of "gloomy cheerfulness" slightly abstracts internal conflict without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from initial unpacking to crescendo hums; CR closure lands cleanly in riddle revelation ("direction of now") with legible cost of shell spent and compass silenced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cliffside observatory and micro-settings (shell, cello) constrain choices, like vibrations drawing echoes; sensory hierarchy (sea roar to intimate hums) mirrors internal gloom evolving to joy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode riddle tightens accumulatively via layered hums peeling voices, forcing trade-off in embracing myths; cost legible in flaking paint and spent shell during crescendo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transient truths emerges organically from reimagined echoes to riddle core; final image of descending lighter reweights myths as cherished without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of wry cosmic imagery; rhythmic modulation supports pressure, though minor elevated diction drifts in peak ("grim ballet") from earthy POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but figurative overload in climax ("bow dancing faster, shadows cheering grim ballet") mixes metaphors, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on "hums" and "reimagined."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of myth-busting via musical shell/cello resonances transforms tropes; risk of lyric hum-method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at riddle payoff.</comment>
