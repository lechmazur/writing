<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in pawn-fidgeting under guilt's pressure and micro-choices like tracing crimson strand compel earned forgiveness; contradictory impulses act in decoding past via threads. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("winnow the self-pity from necessity") slightly abstracts peak realization but stays anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thread-decoding density builds pattern to CR closure ("pawn to king seven...transmuting guilt into grace") with legible cost of confronted past; single scene coherent, orientation anchored by "time-frozen village of Eldridge" in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring pawn and tapestry threads constrain choices (decoding) and charge final image; sensory hush, slick cobblestones, vivid colors filtered through chess-POV bias mirror internal thaw. Environment guides via ajar doors inviting entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening ("fork: advance the queen or sacrifice the bishop") narrowing to mirror chamber; agency in winnowing forecloses pity-path with felt guilt-cost charging thaw image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of winnowing shame from survival emerges organically via thread-etchings mirroring rigged gambit; resonant non-literal answer in "promoting to queen—transmuting guilt into grace" reweights chess-labyrinth premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (chess notation in threads, strategies against guilt); rhythmic poetic texture modulates with hush-intensity, purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action-atmosphere (pawn clicking threads); varied rhythm propels but dense figuratives ("woven hush intensified") border overwriting in decoding beats without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-tapestry decoding in frozen-time for redemption transforms exile trope; risk in labyrinthine prose heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via frayed notations echoing past cheat.</comment>
