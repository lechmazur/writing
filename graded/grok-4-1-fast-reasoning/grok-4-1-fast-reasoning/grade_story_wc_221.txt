<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in pariah gift and family lore compels earned final choice to enter rift, with contradictory confusion and purpose embodied in trembling pencils and surging resolve. Interiority particular through compass pulses syncing breaths. Final renunciation of station shows hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from echoed silence to vibration, compass pulse, sketch-revealed rift tightening to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early (Elara on shutdown deck, anniversary). Decisive Change on-page ("Pushing off... tumbled through") with legible cost ("abandoning the station forever").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dilation field and deck windows constrain glimpse through haze, charging final push-off image; microgravity hum and stretched stars filter via POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy narrows to compass warmth amid stellar blur. Recurring compass as micro-setting enables rift path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to exploration) signaled early, accumulates via sketch-deepening that narrows to rift entry under Accumulative lens. Agency in etching blueprint forces trade-off with station abandonment cost. One tightening forecloses safety, charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heritage transforming pariah isolation emerges organically via sketch and compass motifs shifting from confusion to triumph. Final image (sketching under fresh stars) resonates as non-literal answer to "From confusion, chart the stars" oath, reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in temporal sensations (breaths echoing, time stretching focus). Voice texture modulates rhythmically with pressure, teaching repetitive motifs early for lyric payoff. No head-hopping; diction biased to wanderer lore.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("echoed silence," "true north") taught early supports Accumulative texture but creates paraphrase loops in final third (e.g., "echoed triumphs... echoed silence lingered"). "Word count pulsed to finality" jars as meta artifact, dulling closure propulsion. Density high otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of compass as relativistic true north guiding wormhole transforms isolation trope into pariah's odyssey. Risky lyric ending cadence heightens stakes without gimmickry. Ending litany inevitable from sketch motif.</comment>
