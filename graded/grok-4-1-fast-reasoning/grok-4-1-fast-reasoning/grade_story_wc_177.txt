<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation intensifies through visions tying to backstory survival; internal conflict between veiled present and why peaks in dream-demand "Why?". Minor abstract epiphanies ("transcend or perish") slightly unearned but do not touch transcendence closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of visions/patterns tightening to CR closure at "vision blooming full" with cost of prior blindness; orientation taught early via blind steps pays off. Single scene/shards fit scope; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines, bunker, fungi constrain entry/exit and mirror internal grit (vines part for seen steps); storm charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective urgency sharpens storm's "ethereal grit".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths choose) signaled early, deepens via dream-revelation narrowing to transcendence agency; density cadence reweights under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in fused sight foreclosing fog.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of symbiotic paths/renewal emerges via particulars (child pulled, mother's fall); final image reseals pod non-literally answering why with decay's cost. No moralizing, resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ethereal grit" diction/perception; single POV stable, voice modulates dream intensity rhythmically. Purposeful poetic compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels but "precisely playful" repeats (6x) create patterned artifact without full payoff, mixing minor coherence slips in peak metaphors; rhythm varies read-aloud. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living paths/seer transcendence risks bold lyric voice transforming tropes; inevitable hindsight from directive's design. Non-obvious rule (decay forces evolution) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
