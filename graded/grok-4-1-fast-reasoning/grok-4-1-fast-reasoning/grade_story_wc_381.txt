<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to hush prophecy clear and intensifies during "prophecy's code stirred" vision, compelling press-on choice; interiority particular via "tranquil blaze" in chest but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in ritual climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup from tracing wing to flow surge; on-page RR closure via wing dissolving into "luminous motes" reconfigures prophecy with felt ritual cost; anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook as micro-setting constrains and enables ritual by "slowing to velvet glide" and glowing, mirroring intent; charges final "quiet song" image; selective sensory details (phosphorescent ripples) purposeful under POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively when "prophetic echoes faltered" amid stirring visions, narrowing to endurance choice; visible cost in unyielding press-on alters tactics to silence surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-hush balance emerges organically from ritual particulars; final "eternal peace" image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prophecy premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with cosmic perceptual bias (e.g., "liquid starlight"); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative tone; no head-hopping, diction consistent despite poetic elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors dominate peak ritual ("phosphorescent ripples dancing in serene intensity," "velvet glide"); paraphrase loops on "hush"/silence and "tranquil blaze" x4 dull propulsion; figurative density lacks pattern payoff in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami geometry mapping silence transforms prophecy trope into textural ritual; bold poetic risk heightens cosmic-terrestrial stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
