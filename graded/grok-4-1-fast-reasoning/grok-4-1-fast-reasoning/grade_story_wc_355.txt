<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist traits drive inventive method with embodied calluses and memories flooding during tuning peak; minor slip in alternating summary of backstory ("from battlefield medic") rather than simultaneous impulses reduces crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via building frequency density to clasp's sigh-sigh click; on-page DC closure with time-cost legibility in "precious seconds before the first firework's boom"; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop's rusted tools and pine-gunpowder air constrain pacifist invention and mirror anticipatory hush; recurring workbench and device charge final penning image, filtering through Elias's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalog pre-firework silence) tightens via vibration escalation under textural lens, agency in dialing forcing trade-off between force and harmony; cost felt in sweat-beaded urgency but lacks deeper tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silences-as-empathy theme emerges organically from cataloging acts and battlefield callbacks, resonating in final lullaby image; minor friction from direct "path to empathy" statement in opening dilutes subtextual emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "intuitively descriptive" color-waves; theatrical dialogue ("Yield, dear lock") advances goal with subtext, rhythm modulates from whisper to operatic plea without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion builds in tuning sequence, but overwriting artifacts like stacked metaphors ("pulsed like a held breath, heavy with promise") and silence-synonym churn in climax dull peak density; no loops but minor scaffold in repetitive staging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frequency-tuning clasp via pacifist harmony transforms relic-collection trope into fresh silence-empathy arc; risk-taking in 432Hz payoff feels inevitable from prior particulars, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
