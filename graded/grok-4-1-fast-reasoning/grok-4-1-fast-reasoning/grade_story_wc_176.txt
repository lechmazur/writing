<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve sounds compels reconfiguration choices, rooted in guilt-forgiveness arc shown via trembling fingers and thawing tears; embodied resolve at altar braid-locking hum elevates, though occasional label-phrasing like "snowmelt ardor" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from threading card to illuminate action delivering DC/RR closure; thawing tears mid-fall as exact on-page cost legible in final invocation beat; orientation anchored early in sanctum, single-scene coherence holds without shard transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sanctum's glacial cracks and auroral rays constrain rope reconfiguration and charge illumination climax; wax-caster POV filters details like "perforations with silver conduits," mirroring internal thaw; selective sensory hierarchy (steam breath, conch hum) purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve names tightens accumulatively through braid realignments, culminating in illumination reversal birthing voices; agency in precise knots forecloses loss with emotional cost in wept tears; aurora's "final dance" adds situational pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory transcription emerges organically via card-into-rope pour analogy shifting to eternal archive; final image of rope talisman reweights forgiveness premise without moralizing; subtext in light-born chants layers preservation complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with artisan perceptual bias (imagining card as wax mold) and lyrical rhythm modulating to peak illumination surge; purposeful poetic compression taught early sustains texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering (e.g., "light as the pour that would cast sound from shadow") propels accumulatively but overwrites peak reconfiguration beat with unchecked metaphors and "snowmelt ardor" paraphrase loops (5x); rhythm varies, syntax strong, no grammar slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of punched card, ceremonial rope, and auroral light transforms preservation trope into fresh "light's embrace" archive; risk-taking in method's specificity heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
