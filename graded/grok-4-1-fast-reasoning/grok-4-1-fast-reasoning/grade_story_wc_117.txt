<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in daughter's loss compels locket-sharing choice with embodied restraint; Lila's arc from dull eyes to whisper shows earned change. Minor label-speak in repeated "cautious exuberance" genericizes impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising to eclipse hush; closure as Charged Poise in Lila's "It feels... alive" reconfigures silence with emotional cost legible in tears and tentative smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sagebrush, hush, and dreaming roots filter through Elias's priorities, constraining amphitheater choice and charging final root-tracing image. Sensory balance sharpens surreal eclipse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to link griefs tightens via eclipse cadence shift forcing locket vulnerability; agency and narrowing options culminate in Lila's response with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges from eclipse/curl particulars reweighting grief; Elias's "ordinary magic—like this eclipse" line borders thematic echo, slightly overt in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with mellow perceptual signature (whispering wind, hush); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden in Lila's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Patterned repeats of "softly adaptive," "dreaming roots," "cautious exuberance" create synonym churn and paraphrase loops across peak eclipse beat, dulling density; rhythm varies well otherwise.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse therapy, sage roots, and hair curl transforms grief tropes; irreplaceable ridge isolation heightens isolation stakes organically.</comment>
