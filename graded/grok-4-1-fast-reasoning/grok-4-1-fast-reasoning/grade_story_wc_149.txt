<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied venom/euphoria, compelling transcendence at climax; interiority concrete via flickering memories and pulsing bead. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal collapse—acceptance too passive without micro-struggle. Past-life reveal anchors change with felt cost of binding her spirit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of cameos builds to resonant reconfiguration (spirit joins her eternally) with legible cost (mortal death, "body stilled"). Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one tightening via lingering cameo suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring greenhouse/fruits constrain choices (infused pear eaten, juices etch runes at climax) and charge final image (unnatural bloom, bead inert). Sensory hierarchy alchemist-specific; hush motif evolves causally with fields cracking. Micro-setting (bead from earth) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment via transcendence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through lengthening cameos/venom density, narrowing to death trade-off. Agency in eating/clutching forecloses mortal path with on-page cost at embrace. Climax pressure coherent, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial love/debt emerges organically from particulars (venomous fruits, ashen veil); final image reweights premise (debt transcended eternally) without moralizing. Resonance from ghost's conflicted hauntings; ambiguity in mournful elation lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical whispers, spectral dew); voice texture poetic/rhythmic, modulating intensity (short sentences in venom surge). No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful repetition taught early enhances lyric tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but patterned repetition ("winter-cracked fields"/"hush" x5+, "cameo" x4) borders loop artifact, dulling some propulsion without full payoff in peak collapse. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("euphoria surged, bittersweet and deadly") at venom bloom; rhythm varies but climax prose slightly muddled. Closure image clear despite slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ghosts/venomous repayment transforms tropes via bead mechanics and lifetime debt. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final bead inert reconfigures cycle ingeniously. No derivative templates—organic to voice/setting.</comment>
