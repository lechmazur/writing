<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder's color drives consistent micro-choices like hollowing the ice and tuning bells, embodied in callused hands and seasonal muteness as a "boon." Internal conflict subtle in "resolve surged—a quiet storm," balancing isolation's sharpen with entropy's threat. Boy's crimson curiosity restoration shows earned impact without safety-hedging; no strong contradictory impulses in peak creation beat caps at 8.4.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inciting iceberg drop accumulates via creation frenzy to gale activation and pilgrims' ascent, closing in Charged Poise as "beacon where glistens and chimes wove the final safeguard." Cost legible in "demanding constant renewal" and thaw's "imperceptibly" erosion; orientation anchored early in bluff and post-verbal era; one tightening via full symphony suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bluff's gales and cloud-sea constrain sculpture (arms "dance in the gales," melts "lubricate pivots"), charging final image of sunsets fracturing on ice. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's resonances (whispers, throbs, peals) filters urgently; no white-room as stone cracks under ice thud ground space. Whispering winds evolve causally with sculpture's stir.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder against gray entropy—tightens accumulatively from ice potential to pilgrims' indigo/gold restoration, narrowing via thaw complication. Agency in forging/tuning forecloses distraction path with muteness cost; one deepening in gale's "layered symphonies" forces stance crystallization. Boy's personal bloom shows viscerally felt price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of symphonies unveiling truths emerges organically from ice prisms striking bells, reweighting in final "sacred spectrum" image without moralizing. Boy's dulled gaze flooding crimson ties internal arc to wonder's fight; ambiguity in "half-lies" below lingers via pilgrims' awe. No tidy binary as entropy persists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature attuned to "resonances that pierced the soul," modulating rhythm from "days blurred" frenzy to poised sunset watch. Compression purposeful (creation elided via "frenzy of muted vigor"); diction reflects tuner idiom in "frequencies...weaving symphonies." No head-hopping; elision pays in sculpture's alive stir.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short frenzy sentences to flowing gale cadence); density high as "glistens cascaded...amplifying their song" advances action/atmos. Minor loop in "muted vigor" (twice early) and dense figuration ("frostbitten petals," "liquid light") without muddle, but slight scaffold in repetitive "whispers" risks opacity. Closure image propels cleanly; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal resonances, ice-bell kineticism, and wonder's spectrum transforms tropes via bluff's isolation and thaw entropy. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in pilgrims' ascent without gimmick; "sunsets fracture on the ice" inevitable in hindsight, committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
