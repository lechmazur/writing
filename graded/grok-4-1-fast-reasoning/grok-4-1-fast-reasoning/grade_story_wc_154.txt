<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft meaning onto grief is embodied in trembling fingers accepting coral and feigned curiosity to nurses, earning her tearful reconfiguration; contradictory resolve and ache act simultaneously without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from note-tracing to string-unknotting, landing Charged Poise closure in "tears grafting new meaning" with legible emotional cost; orientation anchors crisply in opening atrium setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist and twilight constrain solitude for decryption, mirroring anxieties and charging final "mist embracing them like a shared sigh"; sensory hierarchy (waves, skylights) filters through Elara's attuned gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to unknot shared fears tightens accumulatively via deepening revelations ("Mama's shadow knots the sea"), forcing emotional trade-off in whisper; cost felt in tears and vow, but lacks sharper option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rewoven anxieties emerges from coral/ropes/notes without statement, resonant in final "tapestry rewoven" reweighting ruins-to-hope; earned from particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias toward symbols ("labyrinthine ridges") rhythmic under pressure; whisper's indirection closes with subtextual balm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak beats ("lotus-hearted threnody," repeated "unknot") with muddled vehicles and minor synonym loops on knots/anxieties, dulling propulsion despite varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Decrypting patois-scrawled cast with coral transforms war-orphan trope into fresh symbolic alchemy; risks lyrical compression pay off in hindsight-inevitable closure.</comment>
