<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to redeem Thorne's name drives concrete micro-choices like volatile elixir mixing, with embodied conflict in trembling hands and gold-flecked tears; internal contradiction peaks during crucible smoking, earning the final attunement. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("luminous regret") slightly abstracts peak emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to coin's second level spin and Thorne's emergence, delivering RR closure with legible conceptual cost in "weight...forged in tension." Orientation anchored early in foundry post-party; single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry constrains ritual (slick anvil halts coin, embers boil elixir), charging final mist with evolved weather mirroring mending; sensory hierarchy alchemical (sigils pulsing, crucible fissures). Body/tools as micro-setting (palm-humming coin, brush strokes) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem name) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tilted scales forcing kintsugi push, narrowing to imbalance risk; agency in "forcing harmony into discord" with visible cost (smoking crucible) charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mended breakage emerges organically from coin/crucible ritual, resonating in final "golden repair" image reweighting name's burden without literal moral. Minor friction from explicit "true alchemy lay in kintsugi intentions" echoing thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with alchemical perceptual signature (essences balanced, sigils "pulsing with verifiable astral force"); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual whirl, brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("stars release me"). No head-hopping, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (short chant lines amid long descriptive swells), motifs like "luminous" patterned not looped; minor overwrite in opening ("mirrors of luminous regret") but coherent, no artifacts dulling closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy-kintsugi-name weight synthesis transforms tropes via "factually mystical" coin testing cosmic scales; risk in volatile ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early hubris cue.</comment>
