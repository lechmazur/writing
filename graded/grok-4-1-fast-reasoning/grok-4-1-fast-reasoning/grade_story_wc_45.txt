<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory skepticism drives ritual choice with embodied cost in pressing tooth to palm and murmuring apologies, earning change; minor diagnostic labels like "shrewdly innocent" slightly abstract interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory density and garden discovery tighten to CR closure in tooth fusion, with cost of forgiven doubt legible in sealed cleft; orientation anchored early in maze threading.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial pedestal and dirt under nails constrain bone-setting ritual, charging final pearl image; sensory honeysuckle and whispering hedges filter through bone-setter's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake of mending certainty deepens via tooth unearthing, narrowing to ritual agency with cost in "envisioning mistakes as errant stars"; coherent pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Constellation image offers resonant answer to doubt-belief tension, reweighting prior cleft motifs organically; near-explicit "Grandma would approve" borders moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bone-specific perceptual signature ("align fractured femur") and rhythmic modulation sustain POV stability; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Yearn" and "cleft" loops across ritual beat (e.g., "yearned her forward, yearned deeper") dull propulsion with synonym churn; density otherwise high, metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with bone-setting ritual transforms fae trope into belief-mending innovation, risking poetic density that coheres at closure.</comment>
