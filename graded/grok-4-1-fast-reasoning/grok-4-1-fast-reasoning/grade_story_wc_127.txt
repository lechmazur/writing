<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's professional thoroughness and affectionate detachment drive contradictory impulses—subsuming Mira's anguish while remaining aloof—earning his faint pang of detachment at closure. Mira applies secondary pressure through her accelerating transformation. Final endurance forecloses full empathy with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from vial arrangement to static-charged climax, yielding Charged Poise RR at "Mira's eyes cleared... luminous stillness" with conceptual cost of counterfeit emotions. Orientation anchored early in grotto. Single scene, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto's static-prone veins constrain calibration ("rubbed the blotter petal against a jagged amber outcrop") and charge final image of "static hummed on... affectionate echoes." Sensory hierarchy (scent, electricity, glow) reflects Elias's priorities, evolves with transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's grief-to-detachment fusion—tightens accumulatively via ragged breaths and pulsing veins, narrowing to "now" gasp; Elias's agency subsumes anguish with visible cost in darkened petal and his untouched heart. Escalation coheres under textural lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically from petal's "counterfeit calm" mingling truth's "sharper half," reweighting empathy/insight divide in final image of Mira's "detached affection mirroring his own" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's scent-static noticing ("ions danced... revealing imbalances"); lush rhythm modulates with pressure. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You've fused it perfectly"); clean limited POV, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwrite in opening figurative cluster ("honeyed light... half-remembered dreams") borders density penalty without obscuring climax; no loops touch closure. Rhythmic control peaks at "static thickening like a storm's prelude."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion alchemy via static-sensing blotters transforms tropes organically; risk in sensorial conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at petal's "secret charge into the night."</comment>
