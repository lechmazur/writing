<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to dissolve walls rooted in Mira's loss intensifies via shell confessions, compelling crowning choice with embodied hesitation; internal conflict acts in pause over override switch. Minor reflective summary of backstory dilutes peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discovery density reconfigures bunker from tomb to nexus in Charged Poise closure; pearl crowning as RR with Mira's echo as felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors crisply by para 2; one tightening via shell anomaly suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal veins and node socket constrain crowning choice and charge final "translucency spreading"; sensory hush/glow filtered through inspector's priorities vivid and purposeful. No white-room; micro-setting (panel, alloy) integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bunker approve/condemn) deepens accumulatively to heart-barriers via pearl, narrowing to crowning agency; cost legible in foreclosed isolation. One cadence shift at extraction tightens pressure coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming abandoned hopes emerges organically from shell etchings to unity image, reweighting isolation without moralizing; final "hearts bridged" answers non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature (hush as breathing, glow syncing) biases to emotional glows; stable close-third modulates rhythm with intensity. No head-hopping; voice distinct without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwriting peaks in hesitation beat ("suspended throb—one beat stretching into eternity," mixed with "vortex's heart"); "hush" motif loops paraphrase-style across 5+ instances, dulling propulsion. Density varies but artifacts obscure closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inspector trope with seashell/pearl in crystals transforms isolation premise organically; crowning turn inevitable from established hopes motif. Risks poetic compression heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
