<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stoic mask cracks with purpose at bird guidance, earning final lightness as soul's reckoning; motivation rooted in traits drives micro-choices like scattering dust. Limited contradictory impulses reduce internal conflict depth, but actions align consistently under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through tablet deciphering therefore bird calls therefore targeted scattering leading to shoots piercing soil; closure as Decisive Change in garden's emergence with felt cost of personal reckoning lands cleanly on-page. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via avian mapping suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming jetty planks and battlefield craters constrain scattering spots, charging final image of "narrow vastness now bridged by emergent green hope." Sensory details like bioluminescent petals and rattling pods filter through Thorne's priorities, evolving causally with renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of land reclamation tightens via birds' "Scatter north" directive, narrowing options to precise spots with agency in intoning rite; cost legible in prior sieges endured now culminating in soul's fulfillment. Escalation causal without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Renewal-through-garden theme emerges implicitly from seed dust stirring into "life's tapestry," reweighting Schism's dirge with non-literal resonance in departing petals. No moralizing; ambiguity in avian memory enriches without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in gloom-shadowed observations; rhythmic prose modulates from clattering hooves to harmonious bird murmur, heightening pressure without elision issues. Voice distinct and biased toward defiant life amid decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "petals drifted into the sea, carrying promises" advancing image and closure; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor figurative density in blooming descriptions purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Eldari-speaking birds and reef-death pact transforms reclamation trope; risk in avian polyphony as method heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via tablet prophecy.</comment>
