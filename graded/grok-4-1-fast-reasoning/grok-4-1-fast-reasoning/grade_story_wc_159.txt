<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in Lirien's loss drives systematic preservation with embodied foxglove regret that softens at closure. Interiority concrete through petal adjustments and tear-tracing. Minor slip: contradictory impulses mostly resolute until final kneel, lacking scene-acting tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds across wings to tube shatter as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting regret with preservation cost (shards tinkling). Orientation anchored early in opal library. Closure cost legible in "foxglove tears tracing her cheeks" amid glowing orchids.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: winds howling against opal panes, tube vibrating, constrain ritual choices across wings. Recurring glass orchids as micro-setting charge final image, petals unfurling to ensnare names. POV bias filters nomad whispers, laughter peals purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names vs. tube failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via widening crack and fiercer winds forcing endurance. Escalation peaks in final wing's crescendo, agency in pressing onward forecloses tool with on-page cost. High-band gate met under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regret blooming into preservation emerges organically from ritual particulars, Lirien's faint name reweighting prior loss. Final image of glowing orchids offers non-literal answer to extinction vs. endurance without moralizing. Resonance from motif shift: toxic bloom to bittersweet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: moonlight fingers, humming blooms bias notice to crystalline life. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with winds' howl to shatter's tinkle. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length, propulsion through integrated action-imagery like "light bloomed from the tube's maw." Minor artifact: "gently systematic" and "foxglove" paraphrase loops across wings dull density slightly, but not closure. High density in peak shatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct feelings museum via glass orchids and cracked tube transforms preservation trope into textural quest. Risky lyric accumulation across wings inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via shattering cost. Non-obvious angle on regret as poisonous bloom enduring.</comment>
