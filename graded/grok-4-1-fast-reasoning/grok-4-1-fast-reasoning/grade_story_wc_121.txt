<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to conquer self-labyrinth clear and intensifies via timeline fractures; contradictory impulses embodied in alternate selves (tyrant, solitude). Final integration earned by retracing genesis fall. Minor abstract phrasing ("burning motivation") slightly unembodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tablet activation → portals → retraces → nexus confrontation. On-page DC closure at "absorbing the shadow," reconfiguring wholeness with integration cost. Orientation anchored early (viaduct, Elias, tablet); one tightening to heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct glow and suspended rain constrain (feed tablet, morph to portals, skimming boots); sensory narrowing under pressure mirrors defiance. Final ripples charge closure image, evolving causally from suspension shatter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wholeness) signaled early, tightens causally through generated horrors and mirrors to nexus choice. Agency in retracing forecloses paths; cost legible in shadow confrontation and hollow alternatives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured self-integration emerges via timeline particulars, not statement; final "conquered equilibrium" non-literally reweights defiance's price. Resonance from procedural loops avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with gravity-defiant perceptual signature (ethereal phasing, skimming boots). Poetic diction/rhythm consistent, modulates to urgency ("sweat beaded... straining"); clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied syntax, high density in action beats; purposeful repetition ("procedural generation") taught early. Minor loops in "darkening brightness"/"fractured" phrasing dull closure slightly without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation as soul-labyrinth with gravity defiance transforms tropes; risk in infinite-reset loops heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from viaduct genesis payoff.</comment>
