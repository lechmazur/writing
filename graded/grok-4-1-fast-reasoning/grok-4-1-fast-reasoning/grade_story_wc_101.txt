<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's persistence compels Tomas's shift from grumbling resistance to ringing the bell, earning the intergenerational commitment with visible relational cost. Lena mirrors this arc credibly. Minor telling of motives slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds receiving → organizing runs → declaration as Charged Poise, reconfiguring passive gratitude into active covenant; exposure risk as cost legible in "sanctions tightened." Orientation anchors early; summaries cohere without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor's acoustics amplify Mira's voice and gatherings, shadows enable runs, charging the final peal and cheers; sensory details (wind whispers, parched earth) filter through Mira's hopeful lens, constraining choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of spirit-endurance tightens accumulatively via Tomas resistance, Lena's enforcer evasion forcing recommitment, to declaration narrowing hoarding option; agency in Mira's organization, cost in persistent risk felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from baskets-to-runs pattern, culminating in Shadow Harvest reweighting scarcity as legacy without moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing sanctions invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Mira with community perceptual bias ("amplified quiet" signature); dialogue natural/subtextual (Tomas: "why invite wolves"); rhythm modulates poetically under resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("gently persistent," "amplified quiet") taught early as voice motif without obscuring propulsion; minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "whispers... amplified") dull density slightly, but rhythm varies and clarity holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile sanctions into ritualized shadow economy transforms scarcity trope; arbor-bell cycle feels inevitable, risk-taking in quiet accumulative defiance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
