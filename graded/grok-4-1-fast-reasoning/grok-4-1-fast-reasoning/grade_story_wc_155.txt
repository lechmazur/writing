<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rediscover joy drives concrete micro-choices like lifting the fragment and light-painting, with embodied contradiction in "heart ached with rediscovered warmth, yet pensive shadows lingered." Final richer joy earned via prior revelation without safety-hedging. Minor repetition of traits doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment find to revelation, network visions, display amplifying communal glow, culminating in CR closure where fog thins as canvas, cost felt in pensive tears/depth. Orientation anchored by para 1. One tightening at light-exposure suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and skeletal trees constrain/reveal via light-projection onto bark; evolves causally (parts, buds hint) mirroring internal shift, charging final canopy image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (light beams, mossy roots). Micro-object (lantern) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled para 1, deepens via fragment exposure and display pulling wraiths, narrowing to pensive variant under Accumulative lens. Agency in projecting onto trunks forecloses lost-youth illusion with emotional cost (tears pricking). One cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of light unveiling pensive joy emerges from fragment's bloom-dance reveal and holographic orchards, reweighting fog/ruins non-literally in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with lyrical perceptual signature (fog blushing, beams like developer). Rhythm modulates to soft laugh/tears at display peak; whisper dialogue natural/subtextual. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "pensive mirth" loops (6+ uses) and joy-synonym churn create paraphrase artifacts pervading final third, dulling closure propulsion; figurative density overwrites reveal beat without payoff. Strong rhythm elsewhere, but −1.0 for spread.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting/exposed film in fog-orchard fantasy transforms lost-joy trope via network-amplified holography; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
