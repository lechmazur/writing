<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to harness ephemeral intensifies via quake pressure into leaf-calibrated fix; embodied intuition ("sweat beaded under his suit") reveals sage traits under stress, though "luminous ache" repetition slightly labels over shows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: quake triggers spinning hand ("second hand erupted into frenzy"), leading to leaf-sync repair; "Click—the hand slowed" delivers DC with quake cost (viewport buckles).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai leaf as recurring micro-setting constrains calibration choice ("timing each stroke to imagined falls") and charges final cradle image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to capture pulsar tightens via persistent quake into leaf-tactic agency; strain cost ("quake waves buckled a viewport") legible during etching beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral-constant harmony emerges via leaf taming clock spin, reweighted in CR ("art of breaking bonds through harmony"); resonant without moralizing, though final dialogue borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual bias ("eyes... chased the ephemeral"); rhythm modulates under stress ("Click—the hand slowed, hesitating").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; "luminous ache" x4 motif risks scaffold in reflective close, but no loops dull closure "click".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Leaf syncing escape-velocity clock fresh synthesis transforms physics trope; inevitable in hindsight from bonsai quake cue.</comment>
