<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior conflict peaks in the driftwood sifting where his own lineage mirrors Mira's, earning the final vow through embodied guilt and micro-choices like pocketing the watch hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as driftwood discoveries densify regret toward CR closure in the final terrace image clutching the watch hand, with legible conceptual cost of perpetuated silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings and jagged shore constrain sifting choices and charge the final watch-hand image; sensory selectivity (brine, damp wood) reflects Elias's biased perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of weighing withheld truth tightens accumulatively via carving revelations narrowing deception path; cost felt in "perpetuated his own cycle of silence," charging resolve without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of false vs. genuine lines emerges organically from sifting lies into truth; final image holding watch hand to light reweights premise non-literally as vow to "rebuild genuine lines."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in symbol-reading (branches for lines, waves for secrets); rhythmic modulation builds hush without head-hopping or withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image, but patterned repeats like "sieved hush" and "tempered regret" border loop in reflective beats; rhythm varies purposefully without muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist forging driftwood truths transforms redemption trope via symbol-carvings linking personal/criminal pasts; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
