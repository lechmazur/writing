<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Blithe trait consistently embodied in humming amid graves and flourish on clock; motivation intensifies post-stalemate to decoding, earning closure realization with ritual cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses limits deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via echo density swelling to silence; CR closure in "echoes harmonized into silence, their purpose fulfilled" reconfigures haunt premise with ritual persistence cost legible on page. Single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and starlight constrain decoding ("by starlight's glow through the silo slits"); callused hands and tools charge tactile unraveling. Sensory selection (dust-moted starlight, cool brass) filters via gardener bias, evolves to thicken gloom at revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape intentions) signaled in ritual, tightens accumulatively via glyph revelations narrowing to exoneration; agency in teasing threads forecloses echoes with clock-triggered time cost. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried intentions emerges via thread glyphs to plea for exoneration; final image of refolded border reweights ritual premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of "fabricated loss" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (gardener's petal-gentle fingers on thorns) with rhythmic poetic texture; purposeful elevated diction consistent as voice-motivated lyricism, modulating tension in decoding beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied rhythm, but figurative density (crimson loops, saffron gambit) in peak decoding obscures clarity; repetitive motifs ("velveteen gloom" x4, "blithe/tenderly" clusters) create minor loops without full pattern payoff, dragging momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener ritual decoding ghostly tapestry via threads transforms cemetery trope organically; chess echo to poisoned gambit turn feels inevitable from established pattern, risking bold lyric frame.</comment>
