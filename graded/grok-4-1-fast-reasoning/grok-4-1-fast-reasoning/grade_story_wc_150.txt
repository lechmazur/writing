<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to restore faith drives micro-choices like excavating and scavenging, embodied in toil over days; interiority concrete via root-tracing and chant memories. Minor slip: epiphanic closure ("faith kindled anew") borders unearned without deeper contradiction shown in pivotal rebuild beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery density tightens from satchel to sundial base, culminating in Charged Poise closure as shadow points to mountain with toil-cost legible ("roots now cradled it protectively"). Orientation anchored in opening para; one deepening via base find suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard vividly selective—roots snaking bones constrain digging, charge final image where they cradle sundial; sensory hierarchy via Elara's wary touch. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith restoration) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening of finds narrowing to rebuild agency; cost in "relentless toil" and scars visible, charging final test. Pivotal mound discovery forces trade-off without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys theme emerges organically from bone artifacts mirroring Elara's exile, resonant in final sundial image reweighting restoration without moralizing. Complexity via wary orchard magic avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of enchanted curiosity; voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating via chant recall. Capped by Q7 debt; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing—"warmly curious" (x3), "cautious enchantment" (x3), "purposeful wandering" (x2), "interrupted" variants—creates paraphrase loops and template cadence, dulling density in excavation beats; artifacts touch final third, obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard and sundial rebuild transforms diaspora restoration trope via bone-root specificity; risk in haunted harmony pays off at shadow-pointing closure without gimmick.</comment>
