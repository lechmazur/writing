<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between fear of painful recall and resolve to unbury talents, embodied in trembling fingers and flooding visions; earned change at glyph-tracing climax forecloses nostalgic path with transformed cost. Minor abstraction in emotions like "ache consume her" slightly dilutes embodiment under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds glyph-by-glyph toward CR closure where "home was the labyrinth itself" reconfigures loss with embedded cost, legible in final stone-glow image. Orientation anchored early in bookstore-mountain; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves and geothermal core constrain path to final glyph, charging closure image of mountain veins as home. Sensory texture (feather rasp, pulsing glyphs) filters through seer bias, mirroring internal unburying.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map home via stone) tightens accumulatively as nightly overlays deepen visions, forcing agency in seeding glyphs; cost felt in "thunderous clarity" rush, narrowing options to confront embedded loss. One decisive intensification suffices, charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed vibration emerges organically from glyph-seeding particulars, resonant CR in "home was the labyrinth itself" reweighting loss without moralizing. Final image non-literally answers shape-of-home question via embedded archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with seer-specific perceptual signature (mercury-silver visions, feather whispers); rhythmic control modulates from quiet burn to thunderous peak, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but figurative density (e.g., "shelves twisted like petrified roots") borders overwriting in opening without mid-beat restraint, dulling some propulsion. No loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer unlocking primal tongue via feather-texture in mountain-bookstore transforms loss tropes; risk-taking in textured lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in home-as-archive CR.</comment>
