<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices under pressure, as in "skin tightening over bones, yet power thrummed," reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final sacrifice earned by curse visions anchored to present. Minor archetypal lean without deeper blind spots complicating peak tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from stone exposure to yoyo decoupling to time reversal; on-page CR closure in "radiance exploding... rewinding the island's cursed history" with legible cost ("body wasting to shadow"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration constrains choices, e.g., low tide exposes stone, lighthouse gears enable dissection; final beam "shattering fate's design" charges image as micro-setting. POV bias filters details purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy fate) signaled early, escalates via causal agency to narrowing: visions complicate but yoyo use forces trade-off with vitality loss; cost unmistakable in wasting body altering final tactics. One tightening at spindle snap coheres under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of costly defiance emerges organically from reversal motifs and sacrifice; final "soul spun free... eternal tick against the void" offers resonant CR answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in freedom's total price avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in reversal diction and rhythmic modulation under stress; stable third-person close POV with no leakage. Compression legible in lyric mode, taught by motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but patterned repetition of "neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration," "latent radiance" borders loop in peak beats (−0.6 aggregate), slightly dulling closure image without obscuring causality. Rhythm varies effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo-fate puzzle, hunger stone, counter-clockwise reversal transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in mythic lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight with no echoes.</comment>
