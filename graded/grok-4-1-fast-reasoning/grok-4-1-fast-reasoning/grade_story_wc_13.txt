<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in illustrator traits drives precise micro-choices like sketching cadences to exploit sculpture flaws; embodied actions align with goal. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly sequential rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal sculpture beat, but closure change earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cadence pattern density tightening to Cradle revelation; closure as CR in "pencils flew...sealed her book" reconfigures preservation with giant's stir as legible cost. Orientation anchored early in rooftop launch; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and sculptures constrain poling/path via tactile bumps and frozen forms, charging final spiraling basin image; POV filters via illustrator's pattern-noticing (e.g., "water's flow pulsed in cadences"). Sensory balance vivid, purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illustrate Cradle) signaled early, escalates via textural density of sculpture barriers and resisted borrowing, narrowing options with nap-time cost; agency in funneling minutes forces trade-off, felt in giant's yawn at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perpetuity-through-art theme emerges organically from cadence motifs shifting at Cradle ("embryos of roars...rooted in interrupted cadence"); final image reweights preservation without moral, inviting ambiguity on fog's silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic, illustrative noticing (e.g., "towers interlocking like skeletal fingers"); voice texture modulates from poised to urgent, rhythmic control heightens Cradle pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in action beats; figurative cluster purposeful around cadences without muddle. Minor density slip in opening tower simile, but no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music theory (cadences) with fantastical ecology transforms quest trope; rooftop canals/Echo Cradle premise risks bold world-logic fully committed, inevitable in hindsight via pendant tactics.</comment>
