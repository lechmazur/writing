<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in euthanasia tourist past compels micro-choices like joining trawl and twisting parasol tip; interiority embodied in frustration at woman's revival. Flaw of loose reality grip enables fearless actions with visible costs. Final transformation to witness earned by accumulating listens, with parasol snap as pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from wake-up to Tomas dock scene; one tightening at failed woman listen narrows to personal hush with Tomas. Closure as CR: Liora's realization reconfigures tourist premise with heirloom loss cost legible in "lace snapped free." Orientation anchored early in tent/marina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory palette—ice clinks, hull groans, brine—filtered through Liora's sound-hunt bias; marina constrains trawls and fall recovery. Parasol tip as micro-setting grounds loose reality, charges closure loss. Final aurora/ice image mirrors internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via near-miss with woman forcing persistence to Tomas. Agency in leaning in, slipping out pays with frustration and heirloom snap. Cost legible in "readiness to chase... unmoored."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of endings as "fold in patience yielding to peace" emerges via failed clinical hunts to raw disaster listens, no direct statement. Subtext in wind/solace motif reweights frustration to home. Final "hush... found home" resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature on sounds/folds; voice poetic yet biased to hush-seeking. Sparse dialogue natural—Tomas's "Endings don't rush" advances subtext. Rhythm modulates from ache to ethereal glow without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("windborne solace") as motif; metaphors like "silk tearing slowly" cohere without muddle. Minor density slip in repeated "crumpling sigh" phrasing, but propulsion clear to closure. No loops or scaffolds dull image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism in Arctic disaster trawls; parasol tip transforms from talisman to unmoored symbol organically. Risky poetic accumulative drive feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening sound-stake ingenuity.</comment>
