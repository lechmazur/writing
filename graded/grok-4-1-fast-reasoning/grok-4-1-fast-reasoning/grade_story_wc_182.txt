<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's careful resourcefulness compels consistent micro-choices like rationing ink and cross-referencing the diary, earning the final renegotiation; traveler's wild eyes and wheezing reveal motivation without deep interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain links arrival to rescues to research-gleaned leverage, delivering on-page Decisive Change as mist parts for library access with journey costs felt; orientation anchors immediately in bookstore's Chrono-Archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Verdant Stacks' Echo-Lilies and Fractured Folios' storms constrain rescues via diary-specific counters, charging final core chamber image; sensory hierarchy favors arcane details like rune-etched lantern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access Library tightens causally through artifact accumulation forcing guardian confrontation; each rescue forecloses solo paths with visible risks like vine-strangled scholar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons emerges organically via pact gaps and botanical bridges, resonating in Elara's vow without moralizing; final golden light reweights ignored warnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with poetic perceptual signature like "rustling pages and whispering spines"; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven, but elevated diction occasionally mismatches urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overwritten figurative density in peak beats, e.g., "silence hummed an unheard symphony of rustling pages and whispering spines," mixes metaphors and dulls propulsion; meta-artifacts like "[Adjusting flow.]" obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical diary as pact-leverage transforms bookstore trope into renegotiable fate engine; risk in research-gleaned "missing verse" feels inevitable from prior rescues.</comment>
