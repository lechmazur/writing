<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Purposefully curious trait compels climb beyond protocol and chemical mixes despite oxygen flicker, embodied in visor fog and deliberate vial uncaps; final photo choice forecloses return path with isolation cost, earning endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oxygen drain causally chains to timed chemical signals, accumulatively tightening via flare eruptions to dawn photo CR that reprices grain's etched legacy with endured summit vigil cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Summit's jagged regolith and vacuum constrain no-rover climb and force chemical waits; velvet-pad grain positioning charges haloed final image under polarizing filters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to photo relic before oxygen zero tightens accumulatively through reaction timings narrowing to dawn endurance; gauge warning and rover lights make isolation price legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grain's developed micro-etchings offer resonant CR repricing space age twilight as nightwatch's chemical-poetic farewell, emerging implicitly from relic endurance motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lunar-specific diction like "regolith sifted by micrometeorites" and rhythmic hush modulation sustain Elias's melancholic perceptual signature through stress to sunlight shatter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense propulsion in "bubbles formed slowly, heat building" varies rhythm without loops; minor stacked metaphors like "shadows clawed like forgotten dreams" thicken but integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chemical Morse flares and etched-grain log synthesize 1972 lunar relic hunt into fresh endurance requiem, transforming space age tropes via inspector's risky vigil.</comment>
