<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to share Lyra's burden via dreams roots consistently in traits, compelling the dream choice; relationships crucible forces interpretation share at climax. Minor slips in stock phrasing like "heart aching" and mild internal contradiction limit to strong but not exceptional. Final healing words earn change with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds: telegram cues dream (causal), patterns accumulate to CR closure where alignment reconfigures glyphs' meaning with exhaustion cost legible in "brow slick with ethereal sweat" to awakening gasp. Orientation anchors early (observatory, Thorne/Lyra by para 2). One tightening via dream sync suffices; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: wind sighs, ink-stained fingers, brass gilding guide choices (cot for dreaming, slits for dawn). Recurrent stars/glyphs mirror internals purposefully without overt symbol. Micro-setting (telegram, journal) constrains dream transcription, charging temple confirmation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode glyphs) signals early via telegram; dream deepens via variable sync, narrowing options with agency (Thorne wills dream) and cost (sweat, hours blurred). Escalation coherent under Hybrid lens to Charged Poise at embrace, foreclosing doubt. No reversals needed; one tightening fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges via pact, dream absorption, temple sync without statement; subtext in Lyra's faltering incantations vs. Thorne's words. Final image ("daylily telegram...legend") resonant CR reweights isolation to harmony, lingering ambiguity in prophecy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Thorne; perceptual signature in star-pattern bias selective. Poetic voice rhythmic, modulates intensity (fevered sketches post-dream). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Share it with me"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting via figurative density in dream beat ("pulsating variables danced like erratic heartbeats...stellar dust") muddles propulsion (-0.6); "solace"/"dawn"/"healing" loops paraphrase ending para (-0.6). Strong rhythm elsewhere, high density, clean mechanics support mid-high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid dreams chart variable stars to decode glyphs transforms tropes organically. Risky poetic fantasy heightens via stellar glyphs sync; no derivative templates, inevitable hindsight at temple glow.</comment>
