<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Earned internal shift from grief to resolve shown through contradictory impulses at chrysalis cradling, tying guilt to wife's death; motivation intensifies via foam insight without unearned epiphany. Micro-choices like sketching in dirt reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure at "Tests confirmed: the new polymer foamed like the river," reweighting past harm with conceptual cost of atonement; orientation anchored early in ravine, one-shard extension to lab logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine foam patterns constrain epiphany choice, charging final image of restored waters; sensory details (pebbles crunch, iridescent films) selective via chemist's bias, mirroring internal flux without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atone via eco-polymers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through foam/river/chrysalis beats narrowing destructive path; agency in lab return forecloses prior rigidity with felt guilt cost legible at deployment success.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of flux over fixation emerges via particulars (foam lattices, chrysalis release), resonant non-literal answer in restored butterflies recharging wife's "Life's symphony thrives in flux"; no moralizing, ambiguity in grief's "soft undertone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with symphonic perceptual signature (molecular/river braids); rhythmic modulation builds to crescendo in "grief now a soft undertone," diction controlled despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density (e.g., "frothy divergence," "dissonant chord") in insight beat muddles propulsion with mixed vehicles; minor paraphrase loops on "loosened grief" and divergence motifs dull rhythm, but syntax varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer redemption via foam/silk/chrysalis transforms eco-guilt trope; symphonic chemist angle inevitable in hindsight, risks poetic overwriting but coheres uniquely.</comment>
