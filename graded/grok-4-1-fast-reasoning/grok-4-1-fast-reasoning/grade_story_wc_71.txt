<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as noticer intensifies credibly through collecting and sanctifying; interiority embodied in ritual actions like drawing orris across marble. Earned change from observer to keeper via bungalow vision forecloses passive noticing with communal cost. Minor slip: vision epiphany borders on unearned abstraction without deeper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from collections to sanctifications to visions, culminating in CR closure where bay reignites with conceptual cost of reversed isolation. Bungalow locket beat tightens as pivotal deepening. Orientation anchored early in bay paths; structure fits continuous ritual progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (cherry blossoms as sighs, orris violet piercing salt) filters through Elias's noticing bias, supplying displaced objects that constrain choices. Recurring streetlights and beach debris evolve, mirroring internal blaze; bay's porches/ivy charge final communal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening at locket vision narrowing to connection realization. Agency in sanctifications forces trade-off: personal insight yields communal displacement. Cost legible in overwhelm clutching etched orris.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred pauses vs. creeping isolation emerges organically from object sanctifications and visions; final porch act reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars like locket photo echo without moralizing; ambiguity in "inadvertent profundity" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in subtle shifts (ivy creep, orris tug); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates hushed intensity coherently. No head-hopping; voice as character reflects attuned sensitivity, purposeful in ritual beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; syntax varies for hush (e.g., cascading visions). Minor overwriting in repeated "streetlights daydreamed" and figurative density (e.g., "pauses pregnant with possibility") risks muddle but stays voice-motivated without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing + ritual objects into hush shards transforms decay trope; orris sanctification turn inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk in communal recharge heightens stakes organically.</comment>
