<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef's gift and past abandonment root motivation, with embodied contagion ("weighing his chest like lead") forcing endurance; contradictory impulses peak in tasting despite risk, earning personal healing as visible cost in final mingling of remorse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dream-cued dig to pool-by-pool absorption, culminating in RR/Charged Poise closure ("pavilion dimming as if exhaling," steps lighter) with endured emotional cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pavilion's "translucent walls veined with eternal frost" and recurring tidal pools constrain sampling/mixing choices and charge final draining image; sensory selection (fogging breath, brine sharpness) reflects chef's tasting bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smooth remorse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening pool densities narrowing to final batch; agency in enduring contagion forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in "gasped, visions overlaying."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective remorse alchemy emerges organically from tasting visions to smoothed acceptance; final "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen" reweights prior bitterness non-literally, embracing ambiguity of lingering cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (tasting air/memories) biases details character-specifically; voice texture modulates rhythmically ("flavors blooming into visions") under pressure, with purposeful motif compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery ("ripples etched in wet sand, patterns like veins"); purposeful "sturdy brittle" motif avoids loops, rhythm varies naturally in peak absorption beats without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, contagious remorse, desert-frozen coral pavilion transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in accumulative healing arc feels inevitable, heightened by irreplaceable pavilion logic.</comment>
