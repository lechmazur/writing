<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Doubt as embodied internal conflict (gnaws, lingers luminous) complicates triumphant closure with vigilant cost, but motivation's "burned fierce" declaration slightly abstracts the drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from planting seed to dream-interpretation culminates in Charged Poise closure ("doubt whispered—tomorrow's dreams might demand checking anew"), with legible conceptual cost of endless vigilance; single-shard structure with dream transition fits scope, orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridge blooms and petrichor constrain planting/climax choices and evolve to swirl gratefully, charging final silhouette image; sensory hierarchy (glow, hum, rumble) mirrors empirical whimsy bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to preserve eroding memory escalates accumulatively through dream-shadow threats to fusion-agency climax under Causal lens; one tightening (Guardian stirs) forecloses oblivion with lingering doubt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Empirical-whimsy balance emerges organically via rite-dream fusion, resonant final image repricing doubt as fuel without moralizing; ambiguity lingers plausibly in fragile equilibrium.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical, Elara noted") biases noticing with equation-cloak texture; rhythmic prose modulates from ascent poise to dream intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but luminous-metaphor density borders overwriting in opening ("fireflies in doubt"), slightly straining coherence without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reality-checker premise synthesizes science/fantasy organically, transforming tropes via doubt-fueled vigilance; ridge reprise risks bold equilibrium without gimmickry.</comment>
