<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in Elowyn's loss propel micro-choices like tracing patterns and slotting eyes; embodied grief in "trembling fingers" contradicts buried optimism effectively. Minor abstract phrasing like "grief's indeterminate ache" slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pouch unpack to stone visions; clear CR closure in "ambiguous loss was not endpoint but pivot" with felt cost of prior grief reconfigured. Orientation anchored early in cavern orchard; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "drips from stalactites" and "moonlight pierced... silver needles" constrain choices (heating wand on fruit, patterns guide cuts) and charge final pulsing stone. Micro-setting of mosaic stone mirrors internal math, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotion's math signaled early tightens accumulatively via hum and visions narrowing despair to possibility; agency in dovetailing forecloses pure loss with conceptual cost legible in "optimism unearthed." Minor abstract stakes slightly soften visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss as dovetailed pivot emerges organically from stone equations and eye visions without statement; resonant CR in final "equations might yet conjoin" reweights grief with ambiguity. No moralizing, complexity in hope's "probable path."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature seeing "fractal equations" in chips; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed description to charged climax without distance slips. Voice texture inventive and consistent, fitting conjurer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but purposeful "dovetail" recurrences border loop in climax (e.g., "dovetailed despair to possibility"); figurative coherence in geometric metaphors taught early, no muddle at visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, emotion math, and cavern orchard transforms loss trope into geometric rite; risk in abstract conceit pays off inevitably at peering-through-eyes realization without gimmickry.</comment>
