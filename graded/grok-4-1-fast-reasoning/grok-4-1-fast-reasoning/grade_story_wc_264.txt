<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Guard's dreamless trait yields to faint reverie via embodied actions like clutching the clock and charming wave functions, earning a meaningful change; motivation to cultivate sparks intensifies credibly from unbidden stir to purpose blooming within.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions and blooms cascades to Charged Poise closure as clock twitches toward dawn with cost of fractured vigil legible in "faint hues tint his vision"; orientation anchored early in who/where/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains choices (pauses at glint, blooms respond to charm) and charges final image of radiant cradle; sensory details like "silica veins that throb" filter through guard's biased perception, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guarding freight tightens via discovery and charm into nurturing sparks across probabilities; one deepening (visions smear essence "occasionally everywhere") narrows dreamless stasis with agency-driven cost in vigil's fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of defiant cultivation from ash emerges organically through sparks/blooms motif shifting from latent to wild; final image of clock thawing and faint smile offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in hushed, fractured diction ("petals sigh," "lullaby shards"); rhythmic control modulates from vigil hush to blooming cadence under pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (hush, blooms, sparks) taught early as pattern paying off at closure; no loops or muddled metaphors despite figurative density, propulsion clear in "wave functions bend, collapsing into nurtured flames."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantum archive keyed by chess clock transforms post-apoc tropes into lyric weave of timelines; risk-taking in "occasionally everywhere" essence across probabilities feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
