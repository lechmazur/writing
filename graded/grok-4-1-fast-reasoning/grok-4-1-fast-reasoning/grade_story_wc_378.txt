<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in nostalgia and static resolution drives micro-choices like opening the box and deploying nanites; interiority embodied in "circuits hummed with nostalgia" and degrading vision under stress. Minor abstract phrasing like "primal urges—hide, run, resolve" slightly dilutes contradiction in peak chaos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of chaos building to CR closure in "wholeness restored—not seamless, but beautifully fragmented," cost legible in thorn-pricked bloom and lingering gentle static. Orientation anchored early in dome-farm; single scene causality tight via shift→static→box→containment→burn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and throbbing roses constrain choices (stabilizers whine, vines lash irrigation) and charge final image of enduring petals. Sensory selectivity sharpens under crisis, mirroring fragmentation; no white-room, lived-in via grippers tending thorns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static/preserve wholeness) escalates accumulatively via magnetic intensification, chaos eruption, and containment tightening options; agency in miniaturization forecloses uncontrolled flight with cost in fragmented restoration. Climax burn pays visible price, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from chaos containment and fear-burning, resonant in final "petals glowed... wholeness, pieced from shards" reweighting nostalgia without moralizing. Subtext in strangely organic pulses shifting from threat to harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with android perceptual signature ("circuits hummed," "servos straining"); rhythmic prose modulates from serene tending to staccato flicker under stress. Voice distinct, poetic diction fits nostalgic core without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but figurative density peaks in chaos beat ("clown-maws snapping, spider-limbs probing") borders overwriting without muddle; minor thematic loops ("chaos contained") purposeful but nudge down. Rhythm varies effectively for ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of android nostalgia manifesting physical fears, miniaturized via nanites into burnable slag transforms tropes; "nanite swarms... shrinking vines inch by inch" feels inevitable and fresh, heightening stakes riskily.</comment>
