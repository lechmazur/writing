<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in climax ("gagged, vision blurring, yet she breathed deep"), earning final harmony shift with sensory cost; embodied olfaction particularizes interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as smell/motion density tightens to Charged Poise closure ("wisdom flowed... poise within sway"); cost legible in "nose aflame" at bloom's eruption, reconfiguring ambition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Treetop sway and gales constrain pot stability in gales ("pots swinging like pendulums"), charging final serenity image; olfactory hierarchy filters vividly through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant serenity stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via smell intensification ("preliminary vapors... tidal wave"), forcing endurance agency with sensory trade-off at bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Decay-as-rebirth theme emerges organically from particulars, resonant non-literal answer in "impermanence births peace" reweighting prior motion/ambition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via olfactory bias ("every whiff a symphony or assault"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, fitting lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in bloom ("titan petal pulsing... tidal wave crashing") borders overwrite without full propulsion payoff; minor motif loops ("wildflower hush," "sway") dull some lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory torment and doodled wisdom in treetop flux transforms corpse flower trope; risk-taking in poetic idiom heightens stakes organically.</comment>
