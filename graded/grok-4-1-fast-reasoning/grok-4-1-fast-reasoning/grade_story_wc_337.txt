<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to ground spirits rooted in brother's failure drives consistent micro-choices like needle work and mask restoration; embodied unrest coils in chest during climax. Interiority concrete but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shade's appearance seeds density buildup through unraveling, culminating in RR (final knot release reconfigures silence to murmurs) with legible cost (lingering unrest, stained needle). Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's refractions pulse warnings (reds for rage, blues for sorrow) constraining restoration and charging final steadying image; silted floor tactilely enables net exhumation. Sensory hierarchy reflects restorer's priorities amid hush-thick air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density (knots' silenced screams, prisms trembling) to final resistance; Lirien's agency in unraveling forecloses unrest with emotional cost (brother's haunting face at zenith). One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weaving purpose from silence emerges organically via net/masks, reweighted in final image (hush disperses, resolve from unrest); non-literal resonance without moralizing, brother's memory as lingering counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (lucid clarity amid hush); voice lyrical and rhythmic, modulating intensity ("needle flew, unraveling relentlessly"). Shade's rasped dialogue goal-driven, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but patterned artifacts (repetitive "hush"/"silence"/"unrest" churn, paraphrase loops like "shade's secret-sharing stretched—tales...") dull peak unraveling; figurative coherence strong yet overwrites climax slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of porcelain masks anchoring spirits, net woven from silences, transforms supernatural tropes via restorer's grounded skill; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
