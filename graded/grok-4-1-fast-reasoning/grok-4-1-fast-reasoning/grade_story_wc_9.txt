<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("trembling fingers, blood loss and awe"); contradictory impulses in willed perplexity vs. clarity betrayal compel ritual choices. Final renunciation of regrets earned via saucer discovery with tears as cost. Single-POV excels without safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to saucer discovery as CR, reweighting lost time with on-page cost ("tears blurred the cards"). Single scene anchored early (post-birth glade by para 1). Closure image of mechanism in swaddling makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glade's vapors and root-altar constrain ritual choices ("vapors thickened, strangling throat"); saucer crack charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (perfumed mist tasting forgotten laughter). Micro-setting (tablecloth altar) evolves causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repent lost time) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via card spread and saucer pry, narrowing to reclaimed futures. Agency in tracing/priing forecloses hollow present with felt cost (regrets flood). Escalation coheres under textural lens to charged closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time hoarded in relics emerges organically from ritual particulars; final gaze "holding galaxies undimmed" reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from family custom without moralizing. Ambiguity in "strangle before set free" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (perplexed fog as truest sight); rhythmic lyric compression taught early pays off in closure cadence. Diction modulates intensity ("choking beauty" to "grace"). No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion (short peak sentences at saucer pry). Overwriting in metaphors ("bloated bruised lung," "velvet noose") strains slightly in opening but consistent/voice-motivated, closure clean. Minor repetition ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed") patterned, not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancy regrets in cloud glade relics transforms time trope via family clockwork heirloom. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final repricing inevitable from established ritual logic.</comment>
