<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to protect key intensely rooted in lover's memory and shown via "rational calculus fused with the raw ache"; contradictory logical/emotional impulses act in calibration beat under pressure. Final adaptation earned with tears as cost. Minor label-feel to "logically emotional" but embodied without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: pursuit therefore sprint, key insertion therefore tuning, matching therefore wraiths absolved (DC) with legible emotional cost in "tears carving hot paths." Single scene, one tightening at vibrational decision; anchors clear by para 1, pattern holds to closure image of key pulsing like heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains sprint ("shifting ice, the bobbing planks"); lighthouse console/tool charges choices and final image (key withdrawn, marina as "cathedral of frozen light"). Sensory selective (salt breath, groaning floes) via Elias's priorities; sunset evolution tightens urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect/use key) signaled early, tightens causally at "adaptation through vibrational matching" foreclosing brute force; agency in dialing syncs pulse to wraiths' wail. Cost unmistakable in "tears" and "body thrumming with residue" post-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony/adaptation emerges via sonic matching mirroring logical/emotional fusion; final image ("flesh and spirit entwined") reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like rune-song layering despair into release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("fleshly glow," "orgasmic clarity" biasing toward ethereal sensuality); rhythmic control modulates intensity. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overwriting via pervasive metaphors/figurative density in climax ("fleshly vibrations rippling... igniting nerves with orgasmic clarity") muddles propulsion; "fleshly" loops 6x as patterned artifact dulling peak. Strong verbs/sensory density elsewhere propel cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse resonator for sonic absolution transforms wraith trope via vibrational physics; risk in "fleshly ethereal" tone heightens stakes organically. Climax turn inevitable from engineer traits and key runes.</comment>
