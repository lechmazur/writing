<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wisely adventurous trait shown in drone evasion via riddle deciphering rather than flight, aligning actions with lore-keeper motives; minimal internal contradiction limits depth, but micro-choices like flake communion earn stewardship shift with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from flake activation to mural reveal to throne DC; orientation anchored in first paragraph; sunrise closure lands decisively with stewardship reconfiguration cost visibly felt in final shimmering orchards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic nano-mists and bioluminescent groves filter through Elara's lore-biased perception, constraining choices like sonic pulse parting veil; recurring orchard constrains climax tactics and charges nostalgic final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunrise stake tightens causally via drone incursion forcing flake-etched cloak; agency peaks in wise communion foreclosing conquest, with time cost legible in chrono pulses charging throne approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mural warning "Wisdom ascends; folly tumbles" emerges organically, resolved non-literally in stewardship restoration reweighting power as bridge to tomorrow without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lore-infused perceptual signature ("whispers of the unclaimed throne"); rhythmic modulation builds from exploratory cadence to charged climax without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action; minor figurative density ("paint to bubble and slough away like molting skin") in reveal beat borders overwriting but supports nostalgic texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia synthesizes cyberpunk quest with Elder lore organically; paint-peel murals offer fresh inflection on hidden paths, transforming trope ascent into restorative risk.</comment>
