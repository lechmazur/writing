<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's curse creates contradictory impulses—raw truth vs. riddle workaround—acting simultaneously when Mira demands details, earning his final smile as preserved wonder with relational cost. Mira's weariness sparks via embodied reactions like breath hitching. Flawless micro-choices under pressure, like reaching for the lacquer box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira's question → curse-blurted truth → riddle handoff → realization → ascent/seed plan, with CR closure in "city would hum again, but changed" reweighting routine with conceptual cost of shattered normalcy. Orientation anchored early in booth/tower/blackout. One tightening via riddle narrows to biological fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lightning tower and booth constrain via toll/ stairs access, charging Mira's climb; nectar dusk recurs to mirror internal shift from "dull ache" to "amber" spark. Sensory hierarchy (thrum, grease, sweat) reflects technician/professional bias. Final "electric honey" recharges motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder preservation) signaled early, tightens causally via riddle revealing "no queenly spark," forcing Mira's agency to seed drones with routine-cost trade-off. Escalation driven by Elias's workaround under curse pressure. Cost legible in "another routine shattered."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder veiling raw truth emerges organically from riddle vs. blurted failure, culminating in non-literal resonance: "tower whispered secrets, routine laced with electric honey" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence after riddle reading layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Elias-dominant, clean Mira shift at end) with perceptual signature: Elias notices "spark dimmed," Mira's "breath hitched." Dialogue subtextual—Mira scoffs but reads, Elias urges truthfully. Rhythmic control peaks in riddle verse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: "curse clawed deeper" embodies pressure without loops; nectar dusk motif purposeful, not churn. Minor overwrites like stacked metaphors ("venom from a wound," "roots") cohere in lyric tone without muddling closure image. Propulsion varies rhythmically to dusk deepening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truthful curse + drone beehive + riddle workaround transforms tropes into inevitable cycle rebirth, risked via bio-electric world logic. "Strike true to light the hidden hive" turn grows from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
