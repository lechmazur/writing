<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to thaw Mira's mistrust drives consistent actions like eavesdropping and doodling, earning her change; Mira's guarded hesitation thaws via embodied realizations. Internal conflict emerges in her hesitant steps and mutterings, revealed through crystals. Final gaze-lock feels earned without tidy epiphany, though secondary status dynamics limited by minimal interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers and doodles build density to Charged Poise closure where "gazes locking in resonant hush" reconfigures solitude with cost ("ledger closing forever"). Orientation anchored early in forecourt; one tightening via lens use narrows to non-verbal honesty. No causality breaks; cost legible in shared silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystals constrain eavesdropping and project holograms, charging final "forecourt sang softly"; rain polishes facets, mirroring thaw. Sensory hush (glistening, murmurs) selective via Elias's perceptual bias. Atmosphere tensions secrecy to revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as doodles force Mira's confessions, narrowing to wordless bond. Agency in Elias placing tickets, Mira tracing doodles; cost felt in "I hid to protect, but it froze me." Escalation coherent under lens, though micro-turn subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Honesty-as-thaw emerges organically from lens-forced truths, reweighting betrayal fears in final image of embrace doodle. Subtext in ambiguous doodles invites complexity without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "transparency thawed it."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (crystal whispers as eavesdrop tool); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to "sang softly." No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. Distinct texture avoids generic narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Rain had polished the crystals to a mirror sheen, amplifying whispers"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops in "resonant hush"/whispers (-0.4), but pattern purposeful; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lens-projected doodles on tickets transforming mistrust in whispering crystals; risk-taking poetic frame heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable premise avoids tropes via non-verbal thaw; hindsight inevitability in doodle mechanics.</comment>
