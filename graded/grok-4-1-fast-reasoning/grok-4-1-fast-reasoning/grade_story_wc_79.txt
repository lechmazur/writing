<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's quietly driven obsession compels whistling despite council pleas and prior expedition fate, earning closure renunciation with clutched silent whistle. Embodied dread ("pooling like sweat") and micro-choices under pressure reveal flaws without safety-hedging. Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through pattern responses to crack's decisive break, yielding CR closure: visions reprice probing as doom, with conceptual cost in drifting city and smiling watchers. Orientation anchored early ("Tortuga Spire... five gargantuan turtles"). One tightening via shell quivers suffices; cost legible in "dooming Tortuga Spire to drift faster."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via climbable rim grooves and warming shell that cracks under whistle, charging final image of phosphorescent brine and groaning turtle. Sensory hierarchy (sun glare masking dread, brine reek) filters through Elara's cartographer bias. Micro-setting (spiral vortex) mirrors internal unraveling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers via patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to crack narrowing options with agency-driven cost: her sequence invokes deadly response. Escalation coheres under lens with shell visions forcing stance shift. Price visible in splintering rim and city sway.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hubris in decoding secrets emerges organically from glyphs, expedition echo, and crack, reweighted in CR: probing weaves shared doom without moralizing. Final image ("watchers sharpened... smiling faintly") offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in pattern chaos avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: spirals pulse, glyphs ripple through Elara's trained eyes. Voice texture ("sunwashed haze," "dread pooling like sweat") modulates rhythmically under stress without filter stacks. No dialogue; compression purposeful for lyric accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short crack sentences accelerating climax, but dense figuratives ("molten gold," "curling like smoke") border overwriting in pressure beats without full pattern payoff, dulling some propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("sunwashed dread" x4, "quietly driven" x2) across paragraphs. Density high overall; no major artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-city, sonic glyphs, bound watchers transforms tropes (lost expedition, hubris) through shell-memory logic into inevitable CR doom. Risky lyric patterns heighten stakes without gimmickry; final smiling watchers inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
