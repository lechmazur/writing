<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirien's scientifically romantic traits drive the alchemy climax with embodied precision; relational revaluation earns change via whisper vulnerability, though Thorne's interior remains lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as densities build to pearl formation; closure via CR in "a pearl of presence coalesced... heavy as a dying star" reconfigures bond with relational cost explicit in the whisper's "eclipse without you."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus at twilight constrains timing and amplifies presence; columella curl as micro-setting charges closure glow in her pocket.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of presence tightens texturally at palette pour to whisper, narrowing to relational agency with cost in shared eclipse revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared presence emerges via spiral alchemy without statement; final entwined silence resonant reweights isolation premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature blends alchemical poetry; dialogue subtext in "revalue your fire" advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering risks coherence in climax metaphors like "honeyed amber" and "dying star"; "revalue" paraphrase loops (5+ uses) dull propulsion in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pocket-sun and columella alchemy synthesize scientific romance ingeniously; whisper ignition transforms presence trope with fresh relational gravity.</comment>
