<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's root-bound traits and scar-linking choices earn her final rebinding with embodied cost, showing contradictory anxious elation. Repetitive labeling of "purposefully curious" borders on diagnostic without deeper tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from clipping press to nexus orb restoration (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in spirit snap-back and crumbling clipping. Orientation anchored early in glade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's pulsing glow and root constraints shape linking tactics and charge closure beacon image against night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to mend covenant escalates accumulatively via vision fragments and maze navigation, forcing orb press with pain/snap-back cost; agency in scar-delving narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Binding dreams to reality emerges via scar-topiary integration, resonant in restored covenant without moralizing; final poise reweights chaos-to-harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Visionary perceptual signature in haze/scars filters steadily; rhythmic diction modulates intensity. Overwrought peaks slightly erode immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors ("pulsed like veins under twilight's deepening veil") and loops ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") pervade nexus climax, dulling propulsion; paraphrase in visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-dream synthesis via root-scars and topiary key transforms fantasy tropes organically to charged closure.</comment>
