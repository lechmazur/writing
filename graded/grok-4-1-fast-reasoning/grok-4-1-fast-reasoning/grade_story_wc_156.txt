<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like humming into the nickel, earning Lena's transformation with embodied cost in her softening gaze. Contradictory impulses in Lena's nested awakenings act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Voice distinction holds in limited dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of awakenings builds to Charged Poise closure in "Let's find out together," reconfiguring Lena's stance with conceptual cost of shattered certainty legible in her nod and itching fingers. Orientation anchored early in garden scene. Single scene causality intact, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden as micro-setting constrains bewitchment via waveform fern and resonant gravel, charging final harmony sigh. Sensory hierarchy (vibrating petals, visible waves) filters through Elias's restorer bias, evolving with events. Body/attention via coin-handling shapes climax choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (convert skeptic) signaled early, tightens via nested awakenings under Accumulative lens, narrowing Lena's options with felt certainty fracture. Elias's agency in tilting coin forces trade-off, cost visible in her gasp and resurfaced memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over certainty emerges organically from particulars like nickel reflections splintering into awakenings, resonant non-literal answer in apprentice nod reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in "time dilated" pause invites ambiguity on magic vs. engineering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (methodically playful noticing of echoes). Voice texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, diction purposeful in sonic lyricism. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden in Voss's question and Elias's reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative density (prismatic reflections, fractal patterns) borders overwriting in bewitchment beat without full restraint, mildly dulling peak propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden and hobo nickel bewitchment transforms myth-debunking trope via nested awakenings, inevitable in hindsight from early talisman cue. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
