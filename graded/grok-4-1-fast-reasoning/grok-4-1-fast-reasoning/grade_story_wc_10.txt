<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music drives consistent micro-choices, peaking in guiding Kai's hand to the tine amid conservatory peril. Kai's scarlet fury adds crucible pressure, forcing her adaptation with earned change. Minor telling in "lined face, etched by saltwater" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: heat-mapping discovery builds to group vibration and Kai's discord tightening to Charged Poise closure. Mending the cracked pane via harmonized vibration delivers legible emotional cost on page. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass heat-maps constrain choices (dictating fork sequence) and charge final mosaic image. Crystalline ferns and glacial lily evolve causally, mirroring turmoil to harmony. Sensory selection (vibration felt in chest, aurora lights) biases via Elara's purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify silence via vibration) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Kai's rage cracking pane, forcing stance shift. Agency in mapping his green core and guiding tine forecloses conservatory destruction with visible cost. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of emotions as silent music emerges via particulars (forks, maps blending to mosaic), reweighting Hush premise in final radiant image without moral. Subtext in Kai's buried love honors pain's contradiction. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalizes Elara's perceptual signature (maps as soul's fire). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing at discord. No dialogue; purposeful elision of sound teaches pattern, pays off in vibration closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense propulsion weaves image/action; rhythm varies, syntax purposeful. Minor paraphrase loops ("silently expressive," "unshaken marvels") recur without obscuring closure, but cap high band. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peak Kai beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hush world + winterglass emotion-mapping + silent tuning forks transforms silence trope organically. Risky vibration premise commits fully, charges closure via mended lily. Non-obvious payoff in heat-map permanence feels inevitable.</comment>
