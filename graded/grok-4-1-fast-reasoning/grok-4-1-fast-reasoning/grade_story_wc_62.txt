<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in decades of carving epitaphs intensifies compellingly to nightly retracings; embodied emotions peak in "Tears carved paths down his cheeks, but his heart thrummed with calm thunder." Minor label-only phrasing like "fiercely meditative" slightly undercuts interior specificity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of specters and retracings builds to CR closure: "collective grief's shape was the ribbon's weave itself," with conceptual cost in transformed craft legible on-page. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse at dusk; one tightening via uncle's specter to core knot suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's fractured glass, mossy floor, and pulsing wings constrain retracings and charge final image of departing butterflies as "souls released." Sensory hierarchy meditative via vibrations in bones; details evolve with migration without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find grief's shape signaled early, escalates accumulatively through nightly deepenings to uncle-led core revelation narrowing options. Cost felt in tears and etched soul foreclosing prior mocking craft; agency in obedient retracings coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected grief emerges organically from ribbon weave mirroring butterfly cycles, resonating in non-literal CR: "sorrow distributed, fierce and meditative in its balance." No moralizing; ambiguity in transformation lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("iridescent river pouring through overgrown arches"); rhythm modulates from meditative trance to thundering climax. Spectral whispers natural and subtextual, advancing mentorship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but "thundering calm" loops (4x) create minor patterned artifact slightly dulling propulsion before closure. Metaphors coherent (butterflies as grief transformation); no scaffold or muddle in peak "saw it" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone craft, spectral poems, and ribbon-weave grief eludes tropes via butterfly migration geometry; risk in accumulative specter build pays off inevitably at realization.</comment>
