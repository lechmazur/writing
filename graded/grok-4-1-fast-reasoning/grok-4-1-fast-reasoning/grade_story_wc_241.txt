<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior conflict between fascination and repulsion embodies well in traversal choices, earning closure reframing; diagnostic labels like "theoretically rebellious nature" abstract early embodiment without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as scrawl interpretations build density to CR closure in archive discovery with reframing cost; legible mosaic shards via guiding messages, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lantern mica pane as micro-setting constrains choices by revealing scrawls and charges extinguishing in final image; sensory selectivity (rain patter, clover scent) mirrors ache purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of responsible legacy resolution deepens accumulatively via scrawl interpretations narrowing to archive, agency in traversal forecloses despair path with felt bittersweet cost legible at "odds tilt toward hope."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lucid contradictions emerge organically through scrawls and manuscript, final pocketed lantern offers non-literal reweighting of inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward paradoxical phrasing ("lucid contradictions"); rhythmic modulation in lyric voice suits accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel traversal; paraphrase loops in "lucid contradictions"/"clover melancholy" repetitions and motif churn dull closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subway scrawls as probability riddles transform gambler legacy quest into fresh mosaic; synthesis of clues to hidden archive feels inevitable and risks lyrical structure effectively.</comment>
