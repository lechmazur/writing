<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's infinite patience shown concretely in hours-long wait before first strike drives motivation to restore balance. Cryptic murmurs and pacing align actions with traits under pressure. Limited interior contradiction; no embodied emotional layering in climax weakens depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fork strike accumulates footsteps density into revival crescendo. Closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on final strike with town's eternal rhythm and Elias's departure cost legible in "fork sleeps." Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain action, evolving from overgrown to gleaming under rhythm. Sensory hush, hum, skitter filter through Elias's tuner perception. Final gleaming stones charge closure image, mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: revive balance before collapse signaled early, escalates via accumulating footsteps layers narrowing to peak unison. Agency in strikes and pacing drives tightening; cost felt in pre-collapse brink and Elias's onward wander. Minor abstractness in greed backstory dilutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restored harmony emerges organically from rhythm vs. discord conflict. Final image of dancing steps non-literally answers balance question, reweighting chaos into endurance. No moralizing; ambiguity in ghosts' gaze adds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward vibrations and echoes. Rhythmic prose texture ("wild hush" motif) modulates with revival intensity. Sparse dialogue natural and cryptic, advancing via "stones remember."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "wild hush," "infinitely patient," "cryptically" creates motif but loops into paraphrase churn (e.g., multiple "before the collapse"). Overwriting in revival descriptions (cracks seal, roofs lift) muddles density in peak beats. Propulsion strong overall but artifacts dull climax rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuning fork as rhythmic bridge transforms ghost town trope via footsteps specificity. Risky poetic accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "stones sing eternal." No derivative echoes.</comment>
