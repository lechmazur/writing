<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elaron's warmly observant trait drives micro-choices like tangential gazing, earning Mira's shift with embodied vision of gritty/silken textures. Mira's trembling hands and confessions reveal flaws complicating her transition. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from confession to pause-vision-CR, reweighting transition as crucible with legible cost in "jagged spikes pierced through—but always smoothing into resilient nacre." Single scene, orientation anchored early in grotto details. Closure CR lands cleanly via cicada's molt metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal pools and jade cicada constrain foresight method and charge final rippling image, mirroring internal states through warped reflections. Sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent glow, whispers) reflects Elaron's priorities. No white-room; lived-in choreography via pool's edge placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's unraveling transition) signaled early, texturally deepens via pause and vision narrowing to textured forge with felt cost in reluctance/scrapes. Agency in cicada placement forces stance crystallization. One tightening sufficient; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from vision particulars (viscous hesitation, feathery release), offering non-literal CR answer in "cicada's molt" without moralizing. Subtext in silence and refracted paths invites ambiguity on change's friction. Protagonist arc inextricable from crucibles motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elaron POV with perceptual signature in tactile time-noticing (gritty drag, silken eddies). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with vision intensity; dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual ("Transition periods devour us"). No head-hopping; elision via indirect gaze taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration (starlight scattering into miniature cosmos). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during vision ("thrummed, amplifying... syncing") risks coherence without obscuring closure. No loops; clean syntax supports textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler, cicada talisman, and time's tactile weave transforms transition trope via specific vision mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in indirect foresight. Inevitable hindsight: grotto's pulse syncs to closure without gimmick.</comment>
