<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority peaks embodied in "tears tracing silent paths down her cheeks," earning the epiphany through obsessive micro-choices like repeated cathedral visits. Quietly driven trait constrains isolation with visible cost in gnawing ache. Contradictory impulses—obsession vs. surrender—act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of layers/postcards/snow melt builds to CR closure ("she reckoned it then—the flowers’ secret was vulnerability’s grace") with emotional cost legible in tears and transformed murals. Orientation anchored early in pavilion/murals. Persistent constraint of window shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion's "amber glow" and cathedral's "etched glass" constrain choices (sanctuary for sketching, site for cleaning) and charge final image of painting eternities. Sensory details (meltwater patter, incense) filter via artist's eye, mirroring internal thaw. 9+ test met fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why night blooms) signaled early, accumulates via deepening layers paralleling snow melt to epiphany turn under Accumulative lens. Agency in cleaning/sketching forecloses ignorance with felt cost (tears, obsession to art). Minor limit: internal pressure lacks sharper external complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "surrender to the dark" emerges organically from window motif shifting to lovers/night flowers, reweighting question in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in "night blooms taught surrender," satisfying 9+ test. Counter-readings linger in grandmother's unseen love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature artist-specific ("vivid swirls," "layer by etched layer"). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure, elisions taught early via postcards pay off in epiphany. No head-hopping; diction purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "gentle scrapes... symbols danced"); rhythm varies with scene breath. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("moonlit petals... defiant splendor") but coherent/patterned, no closure harm. Loops in "umbral tenderness" taught as motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist's quest mirroring seasonal thaw/window layers transforms night-flower trope into vulnerability epiphany. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via postcard breadcrumbs. Bold tone sustains without gimmick.</comment>
