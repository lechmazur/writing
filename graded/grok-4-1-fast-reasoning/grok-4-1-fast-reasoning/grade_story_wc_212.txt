<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in textured pursuit of "gritty silk of moments" drives plunge at climax; embodied contradiction in "trembling not with fear, but...purpose" reveals character under pressure. Minor label-speak like "heart a storm held in perfect stasis" borders abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density tightens shrinking vortex to expansion; on-page RR closure via stabilized maw and thaw with felt cost of lineage erasure risk ("snap back, erasing her lineage"). Orientation anchored in opening lines; constraint of starlit convergence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound atrium's starlight and frost constrain cap ritual and charge thaw in final image; selective sensory hierarchy (prismatic halos, humming winds) reflects POV urgency. Vines and pods evolve causally with germination, mirroring internal order.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen or erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seed nodes knitting rifts; agency in "twisting it like a valve" forces trade-off with entropy yield. Cost legible in shrinking edges and "entropy clawing," charging plunge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Preservation vs. entropy emerges organically through reverse germination and time's "viscous...honeyed fog"; final verdant frenzy reweights premise non-literally without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of chaos/order textures (e.g., "calm rage of ordered winds"); rhythm modulates from hushed hatch to humming sigh. Elevated diction fits fantasy lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (seeds "germinated in reverse"); rhythm varies with scene propulsion. Minor loop in "wild serenity"/"furiously tranquil" recurrences dulls slightly without obscuring plunge closure (−0.4), but no scaffold or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Entropy-reversal via seeds/acorn cap transforms time-heirloom trope into fresh synthesis; ritual's "decreasing entropy" payoff feels inevitable from setup. Bold poetic fantasy commits fully without hedging.</comment>
