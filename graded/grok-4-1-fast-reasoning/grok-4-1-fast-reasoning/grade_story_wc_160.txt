<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to harmonize values drives concrete micro-choices like retrofitting sluices and weaving the chain into mechanisms, with embodied conflict in trembling fingers clashing engineered dams against sacred springs. Interiority particular via machinist's eye spotting iridescence. Final change earned by revelation, but repetitive phrasing like "slyly heartfelt" borders on label-speak without deepening tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: envelope discovery → adhesive analysis → decoding → revelation → new vein-like floodgates → clan test success as Decisive Change. Closure cost legible in "work eternal—machinist's vigilance harmonizing flux" and chain coiled as bridge. Single scene oriented early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcano amphitheater's steaming basin and breathing vents constrain choices, mimicked in gate cadence for harmonization payoff. Dappled light/steam evolves from resolve patterns to dawn mosaic charging final image. Sensory integration purposeful through Elias's tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flood control vs preservation) tightens via revelation foreclosing destructive dams for inventive veins, with clan skepticism testing publicly. Agency in unsealing envelope aloud; cost in trembling triumph and eternal vigilance felt at "ready for the next tremor."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing values emerges organically from ancestor's plea and message decryption, reweighted in clans feasting amid vapors. Final image of resealed envelope as relic offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Encrypted compassion shifts from hidden to binding without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in machinist's precision amid poetic texture ("dappled resolve"). Voice modulates rhythmically but repetitive motifs converge idiom. Elder's whisper natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive motifs ("dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt," "building breathed," "trembling") create template cadence runs and paraphrase loops across beats, dulling propulsion. Overwriting with figurative density in peak revelation obscures cause/effect. Closure image muddled by echo ("Shadows lengthened as the amphitheater exhaled one last sigh. Dappled resolve held the night.") triggers heavy artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist ingenuity, chemical cipher in adhesive, and volcano-breathing amphitheater transforms preservation trope. Ancestor's geometric proofs hiding pleas inflects harmonization uniquely. Risky poetic voice heightens without gimmickry.</comment>
