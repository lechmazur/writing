<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in poetic revolutionary past intensifies compellingly to shard seizure; interiority concrete via verses on palm ("When tempests braid...") revealing contradictory sorrow-possibility impulses. Final quiet victory earned by prior planning causality with felt cost in visions of failures. Minor slip in stock "poetically inclined soul" phrasing slightly genericizes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: motivation therefore plan therefore storm ingress to DC closure hurling shard into mirror with conceptual cost ("forcing scholars to rebuild... seeding unrest"). Orientation anchored early in Elysium Drift. Persistent mirror constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and visible time strands vividly constrain choices (mirrors for ingress, storm frothing rivers); sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency (emerald whirlpools lashing). Mirrors charge final shattering image, mirroring internal reimagination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine via shard) signaled early, tightens via storm alarms narrowing to hurl with agency-driven cost (visions of "alternate failures"). Escalation causal under lens, foreclosing possession for provocation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoing revolutions emerges via shard fragments refracting memory; final whisper ("revolutions die, but their echoes... refract eternal") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing. Shard visions interweave character arc and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (time as "iridescent rivers"); rhythmic diction modulates stress (short storm sentences). Voice as character: syntax reflects poet's mind without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but figurative overwriting (e.g., "gilded spires twisted like frozen screams," "burnished sorrow") pervades storm beat without full pattern payoff, muddling clarity slightly. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud. Elevated diction consistent yet borders purple in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: visible time, poetic shard-shattering reimagines revolution tropes organically. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes; hurling as provocation inevitable from particulars.</comment>
