<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to recycle mistakes drives confession and release with embodied cost in handing over the pull, earning the change; contradictory guilt and resolve act simultaneously. Interiority concrete via drawer pull tracing, but "uncommonly thoughtful gaze" borders on label-speak without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal past raid to exchange + accumulative atmosphere) holds; orientation anchored immediately in parapet/mist/ruin. Closure as Charged Poise in pull exchange and clasp reconfigures grudge with felt cost of relinquishing symbol—"Take it; let it remind us"—one tightening via synchronized untethering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, wind, slick parapet constrain movement and charge final descent image, mirroring internal thaw from "mist beading like unshed tears" to "mist swirled anew." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Elara notices lunar engravings under stress); micro-setting (pull as tool) enables ritual choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exchange for forgiveness) signaled early, tightens via dual pulls reveal narrowing trust options; agency in Elara's confession/untethering forecloses feud path with relational cost in "true prisoner freed was her conscience." Escalation coherent under hybrid lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</comment>Theme of mistake-cycles emerges organically via pull/moon, reweighted in final "recycle shadows into light" image without overt moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, but "turning every mistake to mosaic" nears thematic echo, slightly diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable Elara-limited POV with perceptual bias (moon phases as vow); voice texture distinct in hushed rhythm matching tone. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("The false key that birthed our feud"), natural under stress; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but repetitive artifacts ("furrowed hush," "mist clung/shrouded/swirled," "recycle/uncommon") create paraphrase loops and template cadence across opening beats, dulling propulsion; overwriting in exchange climax with stacked modifiers obscures peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy ritual exchange transformed via drawer-pull deceit cycle and moon-sync, fresh synthesis growing from Elara's flaw; risk in symbolic handover heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
