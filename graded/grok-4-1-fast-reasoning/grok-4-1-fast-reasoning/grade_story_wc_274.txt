<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction embodied in trembling hand on console amid glitch; shift from conflicted duty to complicit purpose earned through glitch cue and override. Minor label-speak in "bravely conflicted" repetitions slightly abstracts peak tension without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glitch density builds to letter send and network cascade, delivering Charged Poise closure in "networks dreamed on" with Regime scandal cost legible. Single scene anchored early (Vault Library by para 1); no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice-glazed shelves and frost-rimed controls constrain override choice; recurring "snow's weight" charges final image of thrum beneath hush, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (swallowed sound, fogged breath) vivid and archivist-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duty vs release) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glitch-forced override narrowing to scandal cost; agency in fingers dancing keys forecloses preservation path. Escalation coherent under lens, with pod hums as deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truths awakening emerges via neural links and "revolution in murmurs," resonant in final pod glimpse reweighting silence without moralizing. Subtext in invisible dialogues invites ambiguity on free minds' cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with archivist perceptual signature (pod monitors, cryo-circuits); rhythmic modulation peaks in "blink collapsed back to normalcy." No dialogue; purposeful repetition taught early as voice texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops on "dizzying quiet" (4+ uses) and "contraband truths" create redundancy touching closure image; figurative density in decision beat ("digital whisper threading") borders overwrought without payoff. Rhythmic variety strong otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cryo-pods as neural webs transforms frozen archive trope into silent revolution; lyric sci-fi synthesis feels organic, with glitch-to-murmurs turn earned from particulars. Bold repetitive diction risks but heightens ingenuity.</comment>
