<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied (heart quickens, chest clenches under burden), with micro-choices like mimicking buckle adjustments revealing values; contradictory solitude vs. reliance on him drives endurance. Muscle memory bridges flaw (forgotten precision) to salvation, earning stasis. Minor voice convergence in repetitive burden reflections slightly flattens peak distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from anomaly to vortex revision, tightening to Charged Poise closure in eternal vigil with isolation cost legible in "core gnawed: each vigil isolated him further." Orientation anchored early (arbor, seeker role). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor vividly selective (branch-fogged lens, creak of wood), with harness/body constraining choices (buckle tests) and charging final image ("arbor cradled him in quiet vigil"). Sensory hierarchy fits pattern-seeker POV; arbor sighs approve adaptations. No white-room; micro-setting (scope, branches) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Lena's trust/success) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rogue updraft then vortex, forcing inventive revisions with agency; cost felt in "one misread... doom groundlings" and isolation. Tightening narrows options mid-radio; closure crystallizes burden. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust forged in foresight emerges organically from revisions and burden endurance, reweighted in final image ("trust endured, fragile as buckle's clasp") without moralizing. Particulars like seed-pods ground universals; ambiguity lingers in sacrifices. Recurring echo motif charges without shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fracturing swirls into vectors); voice rhythmic and biased to patterns. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("trusting your pattern"), advances plot. Elevated diction consistent yet occasionally drifts from harness-tactile lexicon in arbor descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops ("soundless echo" x5, burden phrasing churn in final third) and template cadence (repetitive "His [body part/state], [action]") dull propulsion, especially closing litany ("Patterns held. Trust preserved."). Figurative overwriting (twisted veins, forge mind) mixes without payoff in peaks; artifacts obscure final image sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-arbor world, pattern-seeking via muscle memory revisions transforms tropes into organic pressure; buckle evolution from talisman to doctrine feels inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation heightens isolation stakes without gimmick. No derivative templates.</comment>
