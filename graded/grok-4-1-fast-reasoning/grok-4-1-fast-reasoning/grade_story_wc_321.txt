<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's positivity drives micro-choices like grinning through chaos and clapping parallel Elias's shoulder, earning the merge with embodied fervor; minor label repetition ("resiliently positive") slightly abstracts trait without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds from sideways clocks to radioed merge, with RR closure in hourglass pocketed as talisman carrying "permanent transient" cost; orientation anchors immediately in ferry scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's starlight constrains radio tuning via patterns and charges final pocketed hourglass image; sensory details like "crystalline walls gleamed ethereally" integrate purposefully through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to save ferry escalates causally via fading hull and overlaps to radio action foreclosing divergence; cost legible in self-merge at "parallel Elias faded with a nod."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of timeline harmony emerges organically via hourglass patterns and final pocket, reweighting transient routine without moralizing; resonant in "sideways time lingered in starlit whispers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in nautical lens ("ardent deckhand's eye"); rhythmic diction like "pulsed with the core concept" heightens under pressure, dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images, but minor paraphrase loops ("transient yet forever" / "permanent transient") and repeated "resiliently positive" dull two spots without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry lore, sideways clocks, and pattern-radioing transforms vanishing trope; risk in poetic causality like "radio waves danced via interconnected patterns" heightens ingenuity inevitably.</comment>
