<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's pragmatic rituals embody internal conflict between scorn for omens and devoted whispers to roots, earning his final unbowed stance; auditors apply targeted pressure. Minor diagnostic edge in "wisely pragmatic" label slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to scanner leap (7.8 to 9.3) as CR, with legible cost in maze's prior "withering" feint and Elias's persistent labor. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine walls and fountain basin constrain ritual paths and charge final stirring tendrils; sensory decay/bloom filters through Elias's earth-bound gaze, mirroring his fissures. No white-room; spatial core pulses vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save maze) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via daily rites to climax reversal where polish forces scanner reweighting and council retreat. Agency in chamois circles forecloses demolition with labor cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Malleable luck emerges organically from marble fissures to garden's "feigned withering"; final CR reweights premise via vines' approval. Elias's explanation ("mended deception") borders thematic echo, docking overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-close perceptual signature (bark-dry skin, root murmurs) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual (Thorne's sputter vs. Elias's rasp) advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual chant without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density weaves image/action (chamois "slow circles" into fissures); varied syntax propels to fountain bubble. Minor overwriting in opening sky ("bruised with dusk") but pattern-taught, no closure muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantifiable luck orbs with flawed antique marbles transforms garden trope into personified memory; risk in ritual's illusory mend pays off inevitably at scanner jump.</comment>
