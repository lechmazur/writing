<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode belonging ignites from her isolation mirroring the pilgrim's chart, earning her pivotal choice to pull the lever; pilgrim's traits consistent but thinner. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) act in her pulse quickening and descent. Minor telling in "buried longings" but embodied overall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: chart anomaly cues chip retrieval, drone data accumulates to lever pull as tightening, yielding RR closure in frequency's mend with isolation cost felt in "she belonged here." Orientation anchored early in observatory arrival. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory slits and dusk constrain drone-captured star trails essential to decoding; "brilliant dimness" motif evolves tactilely from gloom to light cascade. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's pilot gaze sharpens on feeds and chip. Recurrent vault details mirror internal mending without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled in pilgrim's gasp, deepens accumulatively via chip inertness to drone data flood narrowing to pull; agency in Elara's breath-driven lever act forecloses isolation with legible mend. One tightening suffices; cost in prior drift reweighted. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Belonging emerges from fractured chart to mended glyphs, final anomaly reconfiguring "more belongs to uncover" as resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Elara's ache layers complexity; irony in skeptic finding home. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV via Elara's perceptions (e.g., "sharp eyes scanning"); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to urgency in "deep breath... pulled sharply." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing characters. No head-hopping; perceptual bias pilot-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots clanging softly" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, motif repetition purposeful. Minor overwriting in stacked lights ("cascade of light as star trail data flooded") but no muddle or loops touching closure. Clean mechanics, varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech in ancient stellar foundry transforms mystic quest trope via "glyphs reformed... humming frequency." Risky poetic tone heightens cosmic intimacy; no derivative echoes. Irreplaceable chip-star trail logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
