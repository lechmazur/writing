<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in doubt over parallels ("was this the true parallel, or another layer") act in scene, driving earned embrace of guardian role with fusion cost; interiority particular via sensory embodiment (shard bites, tang of betrayal). Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy in repeated redirects under cyclic surge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions densify to core birth confrontation; CR closure lands on-page with legible conceptual cost in shard fusion and "weight...steady hum, not a chain." One tightening via layered redirects narrows to truth without breaks; orientation anchored early in bay/Elara.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring bay (emptiness amplifies breath, overlaps with phantom clatters) and shard constrain weaves/redirects; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (oil/ozone parsed by map maker). Final solidity charges image as worlds whisper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening visions (queen/beggar to guardian) driven by agency (twists shard); cost unmistakable in fusion fire and cosmic burden reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embraced burden emerges organically from parallel glimpses and mentor echoes without statement; resonant CR in "weaver eternal" reweights cyclic mappings as purposeful pulse, lingering ambiguity in doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sensory tapestries (velvet hush, metallic tang); rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak surge ("cycle peaked; Elara twisted"), diction modulates dreamily to resolute.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances sensory accumulation); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative weave (threads shimmer, time folded) coherent in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping as multiversal stabilizer transforms tropes; cyclic spontaneity/redirects feel inevitable, risk in lyric shards heightens cosmic stakes coherently.</comment>
