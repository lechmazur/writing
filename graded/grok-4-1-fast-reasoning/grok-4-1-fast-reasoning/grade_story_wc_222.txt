<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "chivalrous thief" and "apprentice of wonder" traits drives swap and playful laugh amid visions; embodied emotions like heart pounding and soft laugh show contradiction without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (bow, whisper verse, dash queen) reveal values with cost. Minor telling of traits ("sacredly playful spirit") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: climb therefore enter, swap therefore rebellion, shatter therefore reset with visions as cost in climax. Orientation anchored early ("icebound spire," Elarion's heist). Decisive Change closure legible in board realignment and sky mending, sundial light as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice spire's "sheer ice," "bioluminescent veins," and "enchanted frost" constrain climb/swap and evolve (thaws at end); sensory mix (howl, crunch, fog) filters through Elarion's priorities. Recurring sundial charges final click image, mirroring reset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend sky via swap) tightens at queen's rebellion, narrowing options via visions; agency in dash costs mental claw, foreclosing retreat. Causal escalation coherent, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of playful wonder amending cosmic error emerges via thief's gambit and final embrace; resonant non-literal answer in "unknown embrace him back—playful, sacred, alive." No moralizing, ambiguity in guardian's rasp lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias ("intuition over incantation"); voice texture in rhythmic diction ("cautious abandon") modulates under stress. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("thief of heavens"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short peak sentences like "One twist, and the queen lifted free"). Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("purples bleeding back") and trait repetition ("sacredly playful") dull peak slightly, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy heist on cosmic chessboard fresh via sundial/swap mechanics; tropes (thief amends wrong) transformed by "sacredly playful" calculus. Risky quiet closure (rappel into mist) inevitable from traits.</comment>
