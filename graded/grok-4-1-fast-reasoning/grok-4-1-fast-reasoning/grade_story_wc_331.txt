<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to access story-space drives concrete micro-choices like tracing folds and whispering verses, with embodied tension in her caught breath during the memory surge; internal conflict emerges in the pull toward immersion halted by the patron's cough. Contradictory impulses act on-page, earning the sharpened quest at close. Minor flaw: brief diagnostic phrasing like "sane in its eccentricity" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds density to scarf's warming and memory flashes, reconfiguring the scarf as half-open portal with felt cost of grounding/subduing. Charged Poise closure lands cleanly—"She refolded the scarf carefully, memories now subdued but stirring"—with legible before/after via exponential branches tempted then banked. Orientation anchored early in library introduction; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective details like "quantum sonnets and fractal elegies" and pseudospherical model constrain ritual and charge final etched arc; patron cough as environmental pressure grounds immersion, mirroring solitude. Sensory hierarchy via Eliza's geometric lens filters vividly without catalog. Body/scarf as micro-setting shapes climax and end image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map story-realm tightens accumulatively at tremor—"threads vibrating as if alive"—forcing trade-off of full immersion vs. endurance, with cost in subdued portal. Agency in persisting ritual narrows options; one deepening sufficient, but patron coincidence complicates without fully resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of analog resurrection via hyperbolic curve emerges organically from scarf's blooming colors and story-space glimpse, reweighting Euclidean linearity in final "hyperbolic infinities awaited." Resonant non-literal close via smiling quest amid pulsing library avoids moralizing. Particulars like poet's observatory memory ground insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in geometric-poetic diction ("horocycle's embrace," "pseudospheres") biases noticing, stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation at surge. No dialogue. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged end image; minor drift to elevated register in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but patterned artifacts like "observed solitude" (4+ repeats) and "sanely eccentric" loops create paraphrase churn, dulling closure litany ("solitude her faithful witness"). Figurative density heavy in tremor beat ("crimson...azure...exponentially vast") borders muddle without payoff. Propulsion strong overall, no grammar issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously fuses hyperbolic geometry, analog scarf-memories, and sci-po library into organic quest, transforming tropes via "fabric resisted...bending into horocycle's embrace." Risky lyric style heightens stakes; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight at memory revelation.</comment>
