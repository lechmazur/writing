<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Insomniac painter's contradictory wry desperation and earnest strokes embodied concretely early, with micro-choices like following trails and exchanging brooch earning closure shift from isolation; Mira's arrival applies relational pressure without overshadowing. Minor slip: trait repetition borders label-only in later beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of rain trails to brooch discovery to exchange, yielding Charged Poise closure in final image of brooch on easel glimpsing purpose with felt endurance cost; orientation anchored by ~100 words in Elias's island painting. One tightening via Mira's emergence suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal island's basalt cliffs, kelp, and tides constrain choices (slack tide exposes pool, rumble reclaims it), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (squelching boots, glinting amber) mirrors haggard internality through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to thresh meaning signaled in opening grind, tightens accumulatively via brooch unearth and exchange narrowing isolation; agency in following/exchanging forecloses solo survival with legible relational cost in lingering fingers and synced pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Convergence theme emerges organically from rain trails, brooch, tides to shared ruin's meaning, reweighted in final brooch-easel image without moralizing; wry endurance resists tidy resolution with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in wryly earnest diction; dialogue natural/subtextual ("Fool or finder?"), advances plot via ancestral reveal; rhythm modulates from pre-dawn hush to dawn pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but patterned repetition ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe," "thresh") across beats creates minor artifact churn dulling peak exchange; rhythm varies, no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-wars tidal isle synthesis transforms isolation tropes via rain-guided unearth and earnest exchange; brooch dragonfly inflects convergence non-obviously, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
