<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to compress eternity drives choices consistently from frost to uncorking, with trembling fingers embodying tension. Interiority concrete in prophetic patterns but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning archetypal over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns accumulate to uncorking cascade, closure as Charged Poise in "Elias held his moment—compressed eternity" with legible cost of library's plunge. Orientation anchored early in glass orchard; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass branches and clouds constrain descent ("navigated the orchard's heart") and charge final shatter into prismatic rain. Sensory filigrees selective via Elias's prophetic bias; vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rupture escalates accumulatively via printing and uncorking, narrowing to trade-off of stasis vs. chaos with cost in convulsing library. Agency in seal-rustle tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of destabilizing perfection for etched permanence emerges organically via frost-to-rupture arc, resonant CR in broadsides as "cryptic seeds" reweighting negotiable reality. Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in type-metal cradle and chimeric pages; rhythmic syntax modulates to short bursts in climax ("Whispers erupted..."). Voice distinct, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive, varying sentences propel to shatter; minor synonym churn in "rustling awakenings" (three echoes) subtracts slightly but pattern-taught thematically without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress prophecy and vial rupture transforms stasis tropes into inevitable plunge; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically.</comment>
