<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between guilt and diligence acts vividly in the reverie, with embodied tears and trembling at the core inscription; final emergence earned by prior micro-acts like notches. No stock phrasing; flaws complicate without hedging. High-band via 9+ test: impulses clash on-page, change costs past twenty years' penance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inscription density cascades to pattern break at sabotage carving, cadence-shifting to peace in final withdrawal. CR closure legible with conceptual cost (guilt's dissolution reweights life). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge constrains ascent and ally at end; pendulum bob/obsidian fire charge reverie image, mirroring internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy (slick stone, oil-salt air, humming gears) POV-specific. 9+ test: setting shapes pause ritual and final caress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (absolution via precision) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as inscriptions accelerate, narrowing to core guilt with agency in handle-press. Cost felt in "weight lightened incrementally"; final reconfiguration forecloses imbalance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges from particulars (notches, visions), resonant in toll uniting village without statement. 9+ test: final harmony image non-literally answers balance question, reweighting sabotage premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (ethical lens on time/village as body); rhythmic texture modulates from fury to peace. No elision or drift; 9+ test: signature holds under reverie pressure.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5<comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short zenith sentences build pause intensity); minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("froths hissed like damned souls") but purposeful for tone, no loops touching closure. Density high, propulsion clear to toll resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pendulum-pause inscriptions on rake synthesize redemption uniquely, transforming trope via tactile ledger; risk in reverie-time pays off at emergence. 9+ test: synthesis inevitable, risk heightens closure without obscurity.</comment>
