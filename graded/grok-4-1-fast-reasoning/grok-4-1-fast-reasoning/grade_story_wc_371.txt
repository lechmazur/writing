<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary drives concrete micro-choices like offering bread unprompted, earning the forgiveness beat; internal conflict over past silence shows contradictory impulses embodied in hesitant sipping. Mira applies relational pressure, forcing rift confrontation with distinct voice in dialogue. Minor label-speak on "heuristically gentle" slightly detaches but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory/memory textures builds to Charged Poise RR in "I forgive you" whisper—tenuous absolution reconfigures rift with felt cost of normalized betrayal, legible in frost image. Single scene oriented early via palace entry; no lens ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard and guerrilla garden constrain choices (secrecy enables ritual) and charge closure via pruned vine mirroring thaw; sensory details (frost-silver leaves, nettle steam) filtered through Elias's noticing bias, evolving with frost and night. Micro-setting (scarred table, vines) tethers pivotal bread-sharing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming ordinary amid creeping fade) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's arrival/confession forcing stance crystallization in forgiveness; agency in sharing bread/tea forecloses isolation with relational cost felt in unacknowledged tears. One deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinary vs. creeping normality emerges via particulars (bread relic, garden transmutation), resonating in final vine-pruning image reweighting silence into promise without moralizing; subtext in silences/gestures like tracing knots invites ambiguity on absolution's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual signature (erosion-noticing: "brittle twigs snapped like accusations"); voice texture modulates poetically yet grounded, dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've made a paradise from trash") with distinct rhythms. No head-hopping; elision of rift details paid off on-page.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bread unwrapping evokes nostalgia while advancing ritual); rhythm varies, propulsion strong to closure. Minor overwriting in figuration ("yeast ghosts whispering") clusters non-fatally outside peak; no loops or scaffold dulling ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as reconciliation canvas in ruined palace transforms bakery-loss trope; risk in lyric noticing-pattern heightens emotional specificity without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via bread-to-vine arc.</comment>
