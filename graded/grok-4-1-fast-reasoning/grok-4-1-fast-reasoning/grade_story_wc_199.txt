<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in folklore devotion drives micro-choices like monument-building and prodding, earning the arbor's renewal; embodied "mossy delight" particularizes emotion without therapy-speak. Minor weakness: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, mostly harmonious progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from single leaf prod to multiplying transformeds and prophecies; on-page closure as Charged Poise in Lir's descent into ashen voids reconfigures arbor's fate with felt cost of ash-depth retrieval. Orientation anchored early in arbor and hush; no shards, fits single-scene default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "ash flakes kissed the hush's edge" and moss-draped walkways selectively mirror Lir's priorities, constraining via falling leaves and ash depths; final procession parts ash skies, charging closure image with environmental evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend fading arbor via decoding) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through sylph's map narrowing to ash-depth gather with visible cost; agency in repeated prods forces tactic shifts without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honoring forgotten via monuments emerges organically from events, culminating in resonant CR where "forgotten things stirred" reweights folklore premise without moralizing; ambiguity in transformation's cost lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in earthy, bioluminescent diction; sylph dialogue natural and subtextual ("You've built well"), advances plot. Rhythmic modulation supports hush-to-bloom cadence, minor repetition untaught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops like repeated "mossy delight" and "prod by prod, monument by monument" dull propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors ("twisted like ancient fingers") pervades without pattern payoff, obscuring peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed monuments unlocking folklore transformeds feels inevitable from established arbor logic; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes like prophetic leaves.</comment>
