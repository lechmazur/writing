<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like adjusting scarf then inhaling deeply despite caution, earn the grief-to-peace arc; minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("memories not mere echoes but living barbs") borders therapy-speak but anchors to vial cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from vial uncorking to plant bloom amplifying scent, landing CR closure in "tears were memory's gift" with emotional cost legible in sobs and shaky rise; orientation anchored early in greenhouse entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via UV-dependent plant pulse and loamy soil buckling knees, charging final image of petals drinking tears; sensory hierarchy (aroma dominance) reflects POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scent-tears link) deepens accumulatively via UV revelation of "molecular ghosts," forcing inhalation trade-off with visceral cost in "sobs wracking his frame"; one tightening sufficient, charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memories as "faithful courier" emerges organically from vial-to-bloom sensory cascade, resonant CR in final image reweighting loss as "gift" without moralizing; no thematic echo slips.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in light/scent diction ("violet glow coaxing dormant seeds"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short sobs sentences under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "crystal shadows" recurrence charging closure, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwrite in "tears welled instantly, unbidden" density during peak but no loops or muddle touching CR.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of UV-terpenes unlocking neurotransmitter "phantoms" transforms memory trope via lantern broker's arc; irreplaceable premise specificity in nightshade revival heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
