<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and stubbornness motivate shard placements under pressure, with embodied reactions like lung pressure showing internal endurance; final merger earns closure via prior toil. Minor slip: contradictory impulses feel poetic rather than simultaneous in pivotal dives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard placements build density to lattice harmony; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with cost in "his body pulled into the lens's glow," reweighting rest as beacon merger. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impossible spaces constrain prism wedges and charge final dome apex; bioluminescent details filter through Elias's haunted priorities, evolving with placements. Sensory narrowing under specter pressure sharpens crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (permanent silence) tightens via signal intensification and stubborn dives, driven by agency in occupying voids; cost legible in spirit dissolution and personal merger under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest's ironic cost emerges from shard lattice silencing signals, with final image reweighting pursuit as self-sacrifice without moralizing; particulars like silt graves anchor resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in haunted light flares and silt echoes; rhythmic prose modulates from weary diffusion to climax compression, voice-biased and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density weaves action, image, and atmosphere without loops; rhythm varies for propulsion, though opening metaphor density borders overwriting but serves taught poetic texture. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned library voids and lens shards transforms beacon trope into rest's conceptual cost; impossible spaces risk heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
