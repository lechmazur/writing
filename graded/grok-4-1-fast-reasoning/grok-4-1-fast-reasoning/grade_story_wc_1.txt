<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's steadily adaptive trait and motivation to find purpose in pauses drive concrete micro-choices like aligning ledger with frost and shattering globes, with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, aching body). Internal conflict emerges in seeing her life reflected in smugglers' doubts, earning her guardian shift. Minor slip: epiphany on pauses feels slightly over-articulated without deeper contradiction in peak survival beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns and ledger pauses build density to secondary ledger discovery and confrontation. Closure as Charged Poise in melting ledger into glass reconfigures purpose with felt cost (art repurposed from peril). Orientation anchored early (canyon, post-attack); one tightening via frost-whorled retracing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain retracing choices and charge closure image, with sensory selectivity (mist breath, filigree edges) filtered through Elara's glass-artist bias. Canyon evolves causally (dawn melts frost), mirroring adaptation. Environment shapes tactics indelibly, e.g., "frost-veils to blind and bind them."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose amid survival) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ledger-frost alignment narrowing paths to secondary discovery. Agency in retracing and globe-shattering forecloses smugglers' threat with visible cost (body aching, paths retraced no more). Coherent pressure culminates in ledge confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges organically from ledger gaps mirroring frost voids and human doubts, reweighted in final glass installation without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable: silences between glassworks parallel smugglers'. Resonant non-literal answer in "golden voids, testaments to meaning unearthed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (resonance in bones/veins); voice modulates rhythmically, poetic diction consistent ("drifting resonance" pattern-taught). No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in lyric mode, legible at closure. Psychic distance tightens under stress without leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via integrated sensory/action lines, but patterned repetition ("drifting resonance" x4, "pauses" x6, "steadily adaptive" x3) borders loop without full escalation payoff, dulling peak retracing slightly. Rhythms vary read-aloud; no major artifacts touch closure. Minor overwrite in metaphors like "stars wheeling overhead in indifferent vastness."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost-ledger patterns transform survival trope into purpose quest, with glass orbs as adaptive weapons. Bold lyric risk (resonance motif) heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable canyon microclimates and pauses yield non-obvious ingenuity at "pauses glowed as golden voids."</comment>
