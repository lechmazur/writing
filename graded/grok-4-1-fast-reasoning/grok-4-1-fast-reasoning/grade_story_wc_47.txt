<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to graft new meaning drives Elara's proactive pendant proffer with earned change; interiority concrete in garden-tied perceptions. Weakness: contradictory impulses summarized via metaphors rather than simultaneous in the exchange beat, limiting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from icicle summons to pendant exchange as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring isolation to connection; cost legible in "viral storm outside faded" against shared fragility. Orientation anchored early in moss garden; lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moss garden, icicles, and drips constrain intimacy by insulating from viral world and mirror grafting theme, charging final hush-deepened image. Sensory hierarchy (humid hush, verdant drips) reflects Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming wounds tightens texturally via Kai's arrival and proffer, narrowing isolation; agency in exchange forecloses solitude with felt relational cost. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grafting wounds emerges organically from moss/pendant/icicle particulars, reweighted in final pact without moralizing. Resonant image answers via non-literal renewal, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elara POV with poetic perceptual signature (light through skylights, moss spores); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It called to me"). Rhythmic modulation supports hush texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density (honeyed hush, moss claiming silicon) in most sentences dulls propulsion; minor paraphrase loops ("protected vulnerability," "quietly proactive") repeat without payoff. Peak exchange beat clearer but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data-center moss garden transforms healing tropes via grafting motif; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes organically to pendant closure.</comment>
