<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete drives all micro-choices, from feather-tracing to kite-mending, with embodied contradiction in embracing the snap's discord. Final endurance of imperfection feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip: interiority veers toward poetic abstraction without full stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: feather find accumulates to kite snap (inciting density break), mending deepens pattern, closure RR/Charged Poise in scarred kite's dance reconfigures beauty with cost of loss legible in "more alive in its scars." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon constrains choices (wading retrieves kite, damp sands enable mending); recurring feather/feather-tool charges final gleam as captured dawn. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor, cool waters) reflects poet's priorities, evolving causally with rain-gusts to dusk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens via snap narrowing restoration options under textural lens; mending agency forecloses perfection with felt cost in asymmetrical sails. One decisive deepening sufficient; onlookers add minor external pressure without dilution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmonized discord emerges organically from snap-mend arc, woven dawns motif shifting via feather-ink reprise without statement. Final image (kite hovering, feather gleaming) offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting incomplete as profound without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (discord as "hush against the wind's low moan"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, consistent under stress. No dialogue to judge; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short gust sentences accelerate launch, longer weave mending); high density, but figurative density overwrites high-pressure mend ("discord hummed... syncing chaos") without full pattern payoff, docking clarity slightly. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drake feather as mend-tool transforms kite-snap trope into woven dawns embodiment, risk-taking lyric voice heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; irreplaceable particulars ground philosophy.</comment>
