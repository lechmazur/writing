<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied surges like "breath hitched, a quietly explosive surge rising in his chest"; contradictory embrace of chaos versus steadying choices earn final wholeness. Minor slips in diagnostic cloud labels slightly genericize peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from string snap to void's Lira smile CR; legible cost in tears and adrift eternity reconfigures options on-page origami release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gondola sway and telescope constrain drift observations, charging final "starlight anointing the brass telescope's gleam"; sensory filter through emotional meteorology bias selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake of proving voids remember deepens texturally via cloud glimpses to "grandest void yet—a perfect negative of Lira's smile"; agency in categorizing forecloses doubt with tear-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spooled wholeness theme emerges via tapestry/string/cloud particulars, resonant in void smile CR without moralizing; reweights premise through earned image shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward "cloud runes" and emotional seascapes; rhythmic control modulates drift pressure steadily, no slippage in single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax; "quietly explosive" pattern enhances without loop, though climax metaphor density ("starlit supernova") borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh emotional-cloud meteorology premise synthesizes grief innovatively; lyric accumulative risks heighten closure resonance from "spooled wholeness" void proof.</comment>
