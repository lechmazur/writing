<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat numbness intensifies through relic mending and sharing, earning her change; interiority concrete in vibrations through stone and bones. Thorne as secondary applies pressure via shared tears. Minor slip: early emotions border abstract summary before embodiment at filament thrum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from repetition to filament hush revelation, culminating in CR closure "music's truest note proved a filament of hush" with conceptual cost of reweighted premise. Orientation anchored early in cavern and Elara's world. One tightening via backward play suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern's stone and hides constrain perception to vibrations, charging final drums attuned to phonograph; sensory hierarchy deaf-POV specific (palms to base, floor quivers). Details evolve with rite, mirroring internal hush. 9+ gate met: setting shapes tactics and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via needle repair → filament discovery → communal rite, narrowing to shared voids with agency in orchestrating. Cost legible in personal memories evoked and tears shed. One deepening charges final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as music emerges organically from vibrations and hush filament, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in mirrored voids invites ambiguity; resonance from particulars like backward tracks. 9+ test: non-literal answer "mirrored and eternal" reconfigures prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with vibration-biased perceptual signature; voice poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm with hush density. Signed "Feel this" natural, goal-driven. 9+ test: distinct signature under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency; high density integrates action, motif, atmosphere without loops obscuring cause. Purposeful repetition ("rustle of turning seasons," "audibly muted") teaches pattern for tone, no muddle in peak filament beat. Minor: occasional elevated diction in calm opens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, backward silence-as-music, and communal hush defeats numbness organically; risk in relic fragility heightens stakes. Transformation test passed: premise inflections inevitable from vibrations motif. 9+ test: non-obvious angle risks coherence payoff.</comment>
