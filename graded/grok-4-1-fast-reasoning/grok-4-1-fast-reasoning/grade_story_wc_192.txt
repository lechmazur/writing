<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the hesitant slipping of the ring followed by its precise heating, earning the final renunciation with embodied scar-heat cost; interiority particular via shadow-tending lens avoids generics. Flawless single-POV execution with motivation intensifying through visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density and pattern (scars, fire) tighten to Charged Poise closure when ring dulls to ornament, with legible cost in her echoing cry and gasp; orientation anchors immediately in sanctuary under starlight. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal sanctuary and coal bed constrain pivotal heating choice, while starlight pierces threshold to charge final image; sensory selection (cold metal to phantom heat) POV-biased and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sanctuary vs. encroachment escalates accumulatively through ring-induced visions narrowing options to renunciation; agency in heating forecloses reunion path with on-page cost (her cry, his stabilizing resolve) charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of severance-forged independence emerges organically via shifting ring image (plea to ornament) and vines/scars motifs reweighting dependency without statement; resonant non-literal close in "shadows curling content" answers central question with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in shadow/filtered diction; rhythmic modulation builds from heavy silence to purposeful hush under pressure, elisions (her distant hollow) paid off in linking visions without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passing read-aloud; mild paraphrase loop on "burn bridges carefully" (three echoes) and motivation restatements dull propulsion slightly (-0.4), but fire/shadow pattern taught early integrates without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of shadow-keeping and bridge-burning transforms isolation trope, with "teach suffocating to breathe" as fresh calculus heightening stakes; ring's evolution feels inevitable from scars/embers particulars, bold lyric risk coherent.</comment>
