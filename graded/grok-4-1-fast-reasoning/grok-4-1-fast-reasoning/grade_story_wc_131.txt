<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "become visible" roots deeply in wife's vow, dramatized via embodied sense memory crash on tape fragment; contradictory grief (tears but smiles) acts in uncovering beat, earning final emergence with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to Charged Poise closure (Elias visible in beam, embraced); sob tremor causally pulls him, tape discovery tightens resolve, cost legible in "no more shadows alone" before final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed library bowels constrain choices (pipe chases force methodical uncovering, nook hides cache); recurring "sapphire hush" and flickering lights charge final dawn strengthening, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tape's sense memory reweighting hiding; emergence forecloses isolation path with felt embrace cost, though woman's despair lacks one agency test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden aid emerges organically from cache ritual and tape's "become visible," resonant in final weaving without moralizing; counter-reading (grief's endurance) lingers via fragment's tug on compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual bias (hush sensitivity) distinct; brief dialogue ("For those who need") subtextual, goal-pursuing; rhythmic modulation peaks in "silhouette resolving," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm, but overwrought figuration ("petrified rivers," "sapphire-deep") in uncovering slightly muddles propulsion; no loops, closure image crisp ("library sighed").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crawl dweller premise transformed via tape fragment's magnetic pull on grief/memory; risk of quiet hush tone heightens stakes in emergence, inevitable hindsight from wife's vow seed.</comment>
