<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map healing geography is embodied in ritual writings and projections, revealing contradiction between nomad ache and wholeness; final rebirth earned via cumulative presences. Strength in specific evocations like Mira's purple-stained fingers, tying to sister's hollow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through deepening obituary projections; closure as Charged Poise in "traveler reborn, steps lighter on gold," with cost legible in frayed thread and tears as waypoints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's sensory details (damp soil, thorny hips) selectively mirror wounds/recovery; thread as recurring object constrains ritual and charges spine tuck in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing escalates accumulatively via obituary density, narrowing ache to stasis; agency in binding thread forces deepening, cost felt in Elowen's projection tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges organically from projections; final image reconfigures absences as "living obituary" with fertile delta resonance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with geographic perceptual signature; rhythm swells purposefully with projections, diction consistent without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in peaks (e.g., "vein of molten amber") and paraphrase loops ("lonesome splendor" x3, projecting phrases) dull propulsion; artifacts in final third cap high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms obits into healing maps via thread projections; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
