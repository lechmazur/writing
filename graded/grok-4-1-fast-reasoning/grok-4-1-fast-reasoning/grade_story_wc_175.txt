<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in grandmother's lore intensifies through embodied actions like trembling hands with histories' weight, compelling higher-stakes building. Interiority concrete and particular via esoteric realist lens blending occult and science. Earned endurance in not rebuilding shows contradiction between desire and transience resolved with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via progressive towers mirroring cadence toward Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early in grotto during migration. Cost legible in "wind rose... loosening the first knot... She did not rebuild," reconfiguring transience with felt dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (dew-beaded vines, rosy sun filter) reflects Elara's priorities, integrated into knotting actions. Grotto constrains via mossy grips and thermals affecting towers. Moth wing as recurring object charges final image, fluttering away on slipstream.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to signal histories tightens accumulatively: towers evolve, monarchs veer closer, then dissolve under wind. Agency in knotting narrows options toward transience. Cost unmistakable in dissolution foreclosing rebuild, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of etching eternity into ephemera emerges organically from knotted signals and dissolution. Final image of freed wing and mental eternity reweights overlooked histories without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like chitin invocations avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: notices wing scales' Morse, geomagnetic spells. Voice texture in rhythmic prose (trill-cut short) modulates with intensity. Lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, rhythm varies (short breaths in pauses, flowing builds). Purposeful figurative pattern ("blushing stillness") taught without muddle. Minor deduction for dense metaphors in building beats slightly blurring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lepidopteran ritualism and science via knotted signals transforms extinction trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of transience without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight in wing's departure knotting memory to moment.</comment>
