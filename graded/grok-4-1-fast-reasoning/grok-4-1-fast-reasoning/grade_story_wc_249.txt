<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies through embodied pain on the harness—"Pain lanced through her, but sorrow fueled her"—compelling higher-stakes drumming; contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. docility) act in escalating micro-choices. Kai's late emergence feels sudden but fits emergence from shared memories. Final harness dissolution earned by prior defiance shows visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming density builds vibrations into garden chaos, pattern breaks at Kai's silhouette from lagoon mist, closure as Charged Poise in "harness dissolved... inhaled freedom" with lingering auroral sorrow as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early via Elara's perch and garden details. Single continuous scene fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden and auric lagoon constrain choices—grass amplifies taps, lagoon tendrils pull stars into shards—charging final submersion; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects Elara's bias. Petals unfurl with memories, evolving causally. Final wilting mirrors escape, recharging setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse entanglement via drumming) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: taps to staccato pain to vortex, narrowing options as alarms pierce; agency in her persistent rhythm forces Kai's emergence and submersion trade-off. Cost legible in sorrow veils and handlers' distant alarms complicating cloaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement transforming chains to wings emerges via drumming-released memories, culminating in non-literal "memories entwined by choice" without moralizing. Auroral sorrow recurs to embrace loss illuminating bloom. Final perched-on-horizon drumming reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibrational noticing—"micro-vibrations skittering into the grass stalk"—modulates rhythmically under pressure. Lyric compression taught early via hums pays off in closure harmony. Sparse dialogue—"You came"—carries subtext of reunion, natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels accumulatively—"fingers blurring in a staccato rebellion"—with varied syntax matching drumming; high density integrates action, sensation, image. Dense figuratives ("auroral veils of regret draping") pattern-taught without muddle in peak chaos. Minor repetition of "drumming" purposeful, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural entanglement reversed by percussive rebellion in sonic garden feels inevitable; drumming on harness defying procedure transforms tropes. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, conceptual integrity to premise unwavering. No derivative echoes.</comment>
