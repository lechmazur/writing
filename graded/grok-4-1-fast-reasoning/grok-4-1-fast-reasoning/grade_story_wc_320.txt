<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her creed, intensified by perigee overload; contradictory impulses peak when she discards "her own creed a trap if clung too tight," earning the attuned revelation with embodied cost in mind-clearing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signal density builds to pure bloom (pattern break); CR closure reweights abandonment as design via gorge revelation, cost legible in "creed a trap" shed during attuning beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perigee's pull constrains ladder climb and cable creak, charging closure as towers resonate steadily; selective sensory hierarchy (moan wind, thrum dish) filters through Elara's practical lens without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to tune signal tightens via tools then assumption-discard, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in attuning yields felt cost of creed renunciation, charging rebirth image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cycles emerges organically from tool-use, signal bloom, and revelation; final "gorge echoed with fresh static, a symphony of tomorrows" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting creed without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "star-whispers," "stellar veil"; rhythmic modulation from frenzy ("garbled bursts") to hush builds pressure, prose syntax reflecting practical fantasy mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density ("moon bloated... creak like old bones," "void-veins drinking whine") borders overwriting in opening without muddle; peak attuning clean, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal tools (Hollywood star, hush shard) synthesize fantasy practicality into indispensable premise; risk of "celestial symphony" reveal transforms ruin trope, inevitable in hindsight via assumption-discard arc.</comment>
