<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority with embodied emotions like skin absorbing symphonies and heart's quiet blaze; motivation intensifies credibly through doubt against rival's warning. Minor diagnostic labels ("grief's sharp sting") verge on cliché but don't flatten pressure. Climax visions of lover's farewell feel earned via prior emotional buildup, with tears as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vibrations/languages builds to stillpoint RR (Charged Poise) where pool touch reconfigures inner maps with emotional cost in tears and resolved chords. Orientation anchored early (Elar in ultrasonic forest under constellations). No disorientation debt; ring constraint shapes entire path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory dominance via touch (gnarled bark pulsing, mossy hummocks sighing) filters through blind POV bias; ultrasonic waves constrain path as felt braille melodies. Pool as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring emotional crystallization. Details evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach stillpoint for emotional navigation) signaled early; accumulative escalation via thickening notes, scorching ring, and stirred grief narrows to pool confrontation. Agency in pressing on despite doubt; cost legible in tears and foreclosed inner chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping unseen emotional terrain emerges organically from skin-absorbed symphonies resolving to heart's truth; final pool image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in converging tongues (Elvish sighs to personal loss) avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (ultrasonic as skin-braille); rhythmic texture modulates from ember-murmur to thrum-crescendo under pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in lyric build to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (blaze, symphonies) taught early and paying off at pool without muddle; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overuse of "ultrasonic" motif borders loop but serves voice; no scaffold or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind skin-mapmaker questing ultrasonics transforms fantasy tropes via tactile languages and emotional charting. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; stillpoint payoff inevitable from established sensory logic.</comment>
