<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's watchful dye master traits drive precise actions like angling the wing, with motivation rooted in post-transplant disruption intensifying to guarded acceptance. Embodied emotions (heart thrumming) and micro-choices under story-pull pressure feel particular. Internal conflict leans summarized in "question quietly explosive"; simultaneous impulses could sharpen peak vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from mist entry to wing revelation, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure as scales ignite with donor's legacy and caution cost. Orientation anchors Elowen/tea house early. Single scene causality tightens via light migration narrowing enigma to warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing as micro-setting constrains choices (rotated to catch trails) and charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (hue shifts via dye-master bias) vivid, mist/jasmine integrated into action. Spatial choreography coherent on rocking rock; environment mirrors internal haze resolving to gloaming smile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel heart's story-magnetism) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via patron orbits and midday luminescence forcing realization. Agency in tracking trails narrows options to wield watchfully. Cost legible in "magnet's force crush the bearer," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balancing narrative allure with peril emerges organically via wing's fractal warning mirroring donor's overload. Subtext in moth/lantern simile and final talisman avoids moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: "illuminate them wisely" reweights gift's voracity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (hue discernment, mist-filtered precision) stable in single POV; syntax modulates from serene entry to revelatory flare. Minimal dialogue natural in murmurs. Rhythmic control heightens pressure, diction character-bound to dye craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism; varied rhythm propels via light crawl. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("dew on spider silk," "moths to lantern") during entry risks muddle, but closure image clean. No loops; strong verbs anchor propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: donor-heart story-magnetism + dye-wing revelation transforms transplant trope into iridescent caution via sun trails. Risky fantasy logic (levitating rock, mist prisms) coheres, inevitable hindsight payoff in fractal map. Bold perceptual angle elevates beyond genre norms.</comment>
