<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's embodied turmoil (bubbles erupting from gills, fists clenched) and contradictory impulses (rage resisting doubt) compel her shift; Thalor's trait-driven actions earn the change. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "resolve cracked" slightly dilutes peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify to CR closure (nuance reweights certainty) with legible cost in Elara's shattered faith and new resolve; single scene oriented early, threading action causalizes third revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (kelp tendrils stirring without current, silt-buried pedestal) constrains action and mirrors internal shift; final garden stirring charges closure image via recurring lifeless-to-animate motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs nuance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via three revelations narrowing outrage; Thalor's agency drives deepening, but Elara's passivity in reception tempers peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of certainty drowning understanding emerges organically from particulars (ampoule visions, garden animation); final image (Elara touching mossy hand, garden approving) offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lush, biased perceptual signature (spectral glow, pearl eyes); telepathic "dialogue" natural, subtext-rich, advances via silk-threading implications; rhythmic modulation heightens revelation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image-action; figurative density (e.g., "gentle scalpel", "thoughts threading like silk") in revelation cascade borders overwrought, dulling peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue threading fragile ampoule transforms guardian trope; kelp-filament action and blight-quarantine twist feel inevitable from underwater logic, heightening stakes boldly.</comment>
