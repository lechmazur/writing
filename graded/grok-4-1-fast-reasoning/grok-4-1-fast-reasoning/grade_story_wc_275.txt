<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist restraint shines in gripping then sheathing the dagger, earning her final stance with embodied contradiction against her father's way. Motivation to weave continuity drives micro-choices like mixing sandbag grit into soil. Minor label-speak in "senselessly perceptive" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (quiet, blaze) builds to RR closure in Jax's nod and etched roses, with cost in foreclosed violence legible at "we weave, not break." Orientation anchored early in dome-farm setup. Single scene fits scope, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome breach and thorn-tangled debris constrain looters' entry and Elara's plant defense, charging final rose survey. Sensory selection (fire-kissed petals, pollen haze) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (roses as allies) mirrors internal poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve continuity vs. looters) tightens via rose tremor intuition to pollen haze repulsion, narrowing violent option under Accumulative lens. Agency in nurture pays off with non-violent cost felt in dagger restraint. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intentional peace emerges via inculcated roses etching "QUIET," reweighting chaos in final image of thriving petals without moral statement. Subtext in scrap holster binds force and calm organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (feeling wind secrets, rose tremors) biases details character-specifically. Rhythmic prose modulates from calm nurture to climax hush. Minimal dialogue natural in "Hold fast, weave whole."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative stack ("serene inferno," "tranquil blaze") in opening risks mild overwrite without pattern harm to closure. No loops; purposeful repetition of "engraved quiet" pays off. Propulsion clear in climax beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant inculcation as pacifist defense transforms post-apoc tropes, with scrap's "QUIET" evolving to psychic weight. Risky poetic voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
