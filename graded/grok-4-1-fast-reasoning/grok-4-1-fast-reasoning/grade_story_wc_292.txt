<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor Thorne drives all choices, with contradictory nerves (trembling fingers, quivering knees) embodied against confident declarations, earning the reversal. Repetition of "nervously confident" as a tic slightly genericizes interiority without fully constraining peak agency. Final transmission feels earned via prior micro-choices like salvaging and decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (journals, nail, glyphs) build density to Charged Poise closure in transmission and lingering dread, with cost legible in "dread lingered, winds howling mockery." Orientation anchored early (Elysium fog-shrouded station). One tightening via confrontation suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog and "spongey dread" (weeping walls, squelching floors) vividly constrain choices like salvaging and vault entry, mirroring internal states and charging final "fog pressed closer, absorbing triumph." Sensory hierarchy map-focused; weather pressures throughout. Environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via decoding to confrontation, narrowing options with Hale's recoil and confession. Agency in questioning archives/transmitting; cost in enduring dread post-reversal. Climax tightening forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked bravery vs. chaos emerges from nail/stanzas/logs, reweighted in final image where triumph edges into "greater exiles ahead." Resonance from particulars avoids morals; lingering dread adds ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with map-librarian perceptual bias (charts as relics); voice texture poetic yet consistent. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in confrontation. Minor repetition convergence slightly flattens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "spongey dread" (8+ instances) and "nervously confident" (5+ times) create template cadence and paraphrase loops, dulling peak beats like confrontation. Dense overwriting with mixed metaphors (e.g., dread as sponge/wool) reduces clarity in final third. Propulsion solid but artifacts obscure rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Coffin nail as cartographic talisman transforms weather-map tropes freshly; jet-shift premise synthesized with guild exile organically. Risk in poetic dread-pattern heightens stakes without gimmickry; final whisper of "bolder hands" feels inevitable.</comment>
