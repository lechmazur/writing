<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to cultivate estrangement is shown through methodical pruning of conversations, culminating in the hangup that earns Mira's realization; contradictory impulses in nurturing then severing feel embodied. Mira's arc via dialogue reveals vulnerability without stereotypes. Minor telling in "to teach endings how to begin" slightly abstracts peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of looping calls and harmonica builds to pattern break at Mira's resolved goodbye, a Conceptual Repricing reweighting severance with relational cost on the page ("I get it now—your lesson"). Orientation anchored early in tunnel/booth. Single scene coherent, one tightening at hangup suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel dampness and streetlamp hums constrain isolation, mirroring internal loops; glass harmonica as micro-setting charges final polish/smile image. Sensory hierarchy (iron-earth scent, dripping pipes) filters through Elias's tunnel bias, evolving with tension. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating estrangement via calls) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through nightly talks to climax hangup narrowing options; Mira's pushback forces Elias's severance, with felt relational cost ("You're my only constant"). Agency in his pruning and her resolve; one tightening charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of renewal via deliberate endings emerges organically from bonsai-like friendships and harmonica loops, resonating in Mira's "hello, my real life" without moralizing. Subtext in silences/pullbacks invites ambiguity on Elias's isolation. Final image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (haunted melodies as sighs); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Mira demands meeting, he evades). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity; no head-hopping, clean free indirect in "Some wires fray for a reason."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm matching loops; metaphors consistent (trapped stars, frayed wires) without muddle. Minor scaffold in repeated "loop/hum" phrasing purposeful for textural lens, not artifact. Propulsion clear, no paraphrase loops dulling closure smile/polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms wrong-number trope via harmonica-haunted estrangement lessons in sealed tunnel; fresh synthesis of phone booth isolation and glass disc loops feels inevitable. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative templates.</comment>
