<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in methodical pacing yielding to blood ritual, earning empathy's bloom with thumb scar as visible cost; interiority particular via posture/essence perception avoids stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (mist, opposites) to CR closure in blood-unified vision and parting mist; orientation anchors quarry/Elara/case early; summary jumps at end slightly blur causality but spare final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry's slick stone/moss/glint constrain grid search and charge scar-pulse final image; sensory hierarchy (glint snags despite face blindness) reflects POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathy awakening via case solve) signaled early tightens via ritual deepening knowledge/options; agency in lancet prick forecloses detachment with pain cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opposites unification emerges organically from ribbon weave to blood merge, reweighting detachment into kinship without statement; final "opposites no longer foes, but whole" resonates as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (postures over faces) and rhythmic texture ("mist coiling like unanswered questions"); elevated diction consistent as artist voice, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("furrowed hush," mist) teaches pattern but risks loop in opening; figurative density purposeful in ritual peak ("pain flowered") propels without muddle; high info density overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blood ritual for face-blind insight transforms cold case trope via opposites motif; fresh synthesis feels inevitable from methodical setup to scar-charged poise.</comment>
