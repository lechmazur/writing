<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation via embodied guilt ("apology clawing at her ribs") and past betrayal driving micro-choices like sifting for the bottle; earned change in fragmented reconnection. Minor slip in backstory summary block, but anchored to present pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with perfume release building density to RR closure (Theo's nod and dissipation as imperfect forgiveness); oriented early in archive; cost legible in bottle shattering and "melody forever altered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via dry paper fueling currents and player piano humming, charging final scorched-paper reek; sensory hierarchy (ethereal grit, ozone jolt) reflects Elara's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology delivery) tightens via uncorking → Theo's appearance and metaphorical exchange; agency in clutching bottle amid sparks, cost in jolt and shattering foreclosing permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically through crackling currents and "stained, torn" sheets; resonant CR in final image of grace before the cut, reweighting metaphors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (metaphorical bias like "gossip's poison vial"); sparse dialogue natural, subtextual, advancing reunion ("fog to the orchard's roots").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion in peak (currents arcing, harmonics limping); figurative consistency voice-driven, but minor density overload in opening stacks risks coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral gossip, electrical alchemy, and orchard doom; risk-taking in metaphor-constrained exorcism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via bottle's reprise.</comment>
