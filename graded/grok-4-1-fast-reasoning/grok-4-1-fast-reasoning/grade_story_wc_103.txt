<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to discover time's texture drives all choices, embodied in trembling fingers and quaking reverie; internal conflict between past visions and obsession acts simultaneously. Final freedom earned via prior causal buildup in fragment use. Minor slip: occasional label-speak like "retrocognitively trapped" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions and hyperbolic paths builds to CR closure where fragment disintegration reweights time as gritty lattice with cost (spectral hold evaporates). Orientation anchored early in garden; no lens ambiguity. Pivotal climax moment cleanly causal under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting's hyperbolic bridges and vines constrain fragment-tracing choice and charge final image (garden steadies, vines whisper). Sensory details (sap veins, crushed petals, ozone) selective via Elias's designer POV. Evolves causally with quake sympathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape retrocognitive trap to feel time's texture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via intensifying visions and fragment invocation. Agency in mental navigation forecloses past-loop path; cost legible in fragment's shriek and disintegration. Minor abstractness in stakes before halo find slightly softens early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time's tactile grit emerges organically from geometry, visions, and revelation; final image ripples texture through skin as non-literal answer reweighting past trap. Recurring quaking motif shifts from torment to alive freedom without moralizing. Resonant without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hyperbolic diction and quaking rhythm matches Elias's reverie; stable single POV with no leakage. Prose modulates intensity purposefully. Experimental compression legible under taught lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but overwriting with figurative stacks (e.g., "fractal spirals that mirrored the maze's infinite expanse") in climax dulls slightly without tighter pattern payoff; quaking/trembling loops (−0.4). Rhythm varies read-aloud. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, living bridges, and halo fragment transforms maze trope into time-texture obsession; bold risk in non-Euclidean incantation heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight closure via disintegration.</comment>
