<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai's numbness as consistent trait compels higher-stakes rite invocation, embodied in blood mingling; clone's emergence reveals relational crucible. Internal void contrasts clone's wholeness without alternating summaries. Minor stock phrasing like "emotional numbness defeated" limits peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via Blade slices therefore illusions shatter, leading to jar seizure and rite; DC closure in fusion with blood cost on altar. Orientation anchored early in dojo battle. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo's wards repel Elara, constraining climax; temporal vortices evolve with events, mirroring psyche chaos in birth rewrite flicker. Sensory hierarchy narrows to Blade hum under crisis. Recurrent altar charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant custody stake tightens via drone reversal, forcing jar seizure and rite agency; blood cost alters tactics legibly. Causal escalation narrows to vivification trade-off. Elara's pressure coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Opposites fusion theme emerges via lore to clone's "complement" gasp, reweighting division without moral; subtext in pretense slices invites ambiguity on hive vs. unity. Final dyad image resonates non-literally. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias in "numbness fueling resolve"; dialogue subtextual in taunt exchange advances goal. Rhythmic prose modulates intensity without head-hopping. Diction fits fantastical idiom consistently.</comment>
