<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to compile fragments drives steady choices, culminating in earned crowd-heartening; reactively visionary trait shown concretely via spray-triggered visions seizing him early. Limited contradictory impulses—endurance without visible internal struggle—caps higher scores, as no simultaneous conflicting actions appear in pivotal valve-blowing moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through staggered intervals to CR closure: final moonrise blast reconfigures absences as "bridges, not breaks" with legible cost in "exile's scars softening." Orientation anchored early (Elias at harbor post-exile); single scene with taught pattern suffices. Minor abstraction in cost legibility ("profound meaning") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain vividly specific, spray as micro-setting constrains visions and charges final image ("spray a silver veil," "spray anointing him"). Sensory selection purposeful (salt, mist mirroring absences). Selective detail integrated into action elevates, but no single tool/object beyond spray fully constrains a peak choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile fragments to hearten amid absences) signaled early, escalates via interval cadence shifts under Accumulative lens, narrowing to collective reconfiguration. Agency in valve notes forces deepening; visible cost in crowd's "sobs" and softened scars. One tightening sufficient, but lacks personal trade-off for Elias.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of absences-as-bridges emerges organically from visions and relics, resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing. Particulars (locket, manifestos) build complexity; subtext in crowd responses invites ambiguity. Final realization reweights premise effectively under lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (spray-filtered noticing); poetic diction/rhythm consistent, modulates with visionary intensity. Sparse dialogue natural ("You navigate absences with me"), goal-driven. No head-hopping; voice lyric but legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short gasps amid long visionary swells); high density, but figurative overuse in peak intervals ("crescendo harmonizing," "silver veil") risks muddle without pattern payoff, docking prose propulsion. Minor motif loops ("fragments," "spray") purposeful but borderline redundant in compiling beat. Clean mechanics overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary archivist, pulsing valve, and interval visions transforms exile trope into inevitable closure; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance. Specifics (bone shards, sigils) feel organic, non-obvious angle on loss/memorial.</comment>
