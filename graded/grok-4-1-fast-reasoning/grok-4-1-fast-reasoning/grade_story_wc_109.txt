<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Oracle's mild obsession roots consistent traits and compels map-sharing under night pressure; Elara's desperation yields embodied awe in gasping at patterns. Internal conflicts subtle but present in frown-to-urging arc. Minor slip: emotions occasionally abstract ("awe threading the hush") over fully contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silences accumulate into map contours, one tightening via demonstration. Orientation anchored early in fort entry. Closure as Charged Poise in "ambered silence sealed their pact" with fading star cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fort's alcove and mortar gaps constrain listening choices, charging map sketch. Sensory hush vs. storm vivid and POV-biased (oracle's agate eyes). Evolving star pins time/atmosphere to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (night-map) signaled early, deepens via silence demos narrowing ignorance. Agency in oracle's retelling and Elara's urging; star's pulse/wink forces crystallization. Cost felt in obsession's endurance amid dimming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-map emerges implicitly from pebble lore to fragment grasp, resonant without statement. Final image reweights hush as beacon. No moralizing, ambiguity in "yields its chart."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited with perceptual hush-signature; dialogue subtextual (Elara's "Show me" pursues goal). Rhythm modulates intensity, voices distinct (murmur vs. ragged). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative language (ambered/marble hush variants) patterns-taught but risks overwriting in demo beat ("waves of quiet pooled"). Mild paraphrase loops in hush synonyms dull propulsion slightly. Strong read-aloud rhythm overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh silence-summary twists prophecy trope into map-making synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens endless night stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
