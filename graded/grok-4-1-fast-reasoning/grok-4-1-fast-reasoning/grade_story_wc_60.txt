<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and imagination create contradictory impulses shown in her refusal to force the box, earning the patient trail; traits drive micro-choices like scanning for breadcrumbs without label-speak dominating pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as breadcrumb density tightens to closure's DC (key unlocks box); orientation anchored early in city/fountains/geese; cost legible in sidereal patience foreclosing haste, charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fountains network constrains breadcrumb path and charges final cascade; selective sensory details (moss/dust, thrumming memories) mirror internal glow and evolve with trail; no white-room, spatial choreography clear across alleys/piazza.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via breadcrumbs narrowing to unstick; agency in patient following forces trade-off (haste risks shatter); cost felt in endurance syncing with stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic subtlety over force emerges organically from skeptic's trail to resonant CR (memories reweight city's stasis); final image non-literal answer to skepticism, ambiguity in "faintly" smile lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with luminous perceptual signature (starlight skin, patterns from ordinary); lyrical rhythm modulates hush to symphony; purposeful compression in breadcrumb beats legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene hush to cascade; high density integrates image/action; minor figurative density in opening (bruised sky, liquid songs) taught as pattern without muddling closure click/sighs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of paused geese/breadcrumbs as sidereal trail transforms stasis trope; risk in vignette arc heightens cosmic stakes, inevitable hindsight from Elara's grounded vision.</comment>
