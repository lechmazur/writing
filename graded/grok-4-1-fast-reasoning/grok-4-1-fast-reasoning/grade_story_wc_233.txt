<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elowen's disenchantment fuels consistent motivation from dreams to inhaled transformation, with micro-choices like commanding Thorne revealing values under grotto pressure. Interiority concrete via embodied visions, but occasional stock phrasing like "fraying soul" slightly genericizes impulses. Final embrace earns change with relational cost to Thorne's tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from dreams/climb to grotto cadence shift. Orientation anchored early (queen, throne, warning). Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page in "inhaled the bleeding starlight, letting it scour her disenchantment," with felt cost of surrendered heart reconfiguring reign.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto and ember-veined walls constrain choices (pools touched, tendrils coil) and charge final image of dispersed fireflies. Sensory hierarchy narrows under peril (humming air, pulsing light). Ridge/clouds evolve causally with ascent, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams/curse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via climb strain, pool visions, vortex menace tightening to inhale trade-off. Agency in hand extension despite Thorne's blade, foreclosing disenchantment path. Cost legible in "noose of glowing threads" and scourging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of peril-reclaimed power emerges organically from dream curse to vengeful grace, with fireflies/starlight shifting from wound to crown. Final image ("eyes gleamed with starlit resolve") offers non-literal answer reweighting disenchantment without moralizing. Subtext in laced temptations avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual bias (Elowen's dream-laced noticing). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic syntax, modulating from velvet command to peril-laced prose. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Stay; this unraveling is mine"), distinguishing Thorne's murmur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak grotto beats with stacked metaphors ("lacy menace," "thorns beneath silk") and minor synonym loops ("softly commanding" thrice) dull immersion, violating density check. Rhythm varies but figurative muddle in "fireflies swirling into a vortex" risks coherence. Propulsion strong elsewhere, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy quest trope transformed via textural starlight curse and firefly unlock into menace-laced empowerment. Fresh synthesis in grotto's "wounded heart" pulsing with queen's bloodline, risking bold lyric ascent payoff. No derivative echoes; particulars inevitable to starlit resolve.</comment>
