<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict between empiricist denial and mystic surfacing, embodied in thinning "rational shell" and pulse-syncing hum; earned change via denial break feels motivated. Minor label-speak ("attentive mystic") slightly abstracts traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("no more lies, only communion"); frost words "*Feel me*" deliver legible conceptual cost of shattered self-deception. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz arbor mist and frost dendrites constrain observation and charge final image (mist parts like applause); sensory hierarchy (visual fractals, tactile cold seeping veins) reflects Elias's priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove absorption) escalates via pattern-deepening (colors to faces to words), forcing agency in communion; cost felt in emotional merger ("grief had steered the wheel"). Lens-driven tightening coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of emotional residue bridging science/mysticism emerges organically from frost revelations; final "prism warm...arbor's quartz sang" reweights denial without moralizing. Strong subtext in "truthful lies."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns as "neural maps of forgotten sorrows"); rhythmic lyricism modulates intensity, taught early for legible Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (frost "etching her name") integrate action. Minor overwriting density in revelation beat ("mist coiling like serpents") borders muddle but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empiricism/mysticism via frost-prism mechanics transforms trope; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from arbor setup to vindicated purr.</comment>
