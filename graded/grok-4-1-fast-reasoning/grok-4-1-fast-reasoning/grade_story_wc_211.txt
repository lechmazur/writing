<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied "velvet disquiet" threading contradictory collector's loneliness; final vow earned by immersion rite confronting unshared emotions. Contradictory impulses in feverish transcription vs. freezing at prophecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: relic immersion texturally builds to CR closure in prophecy mirroring personal flaw, with cost in "chill seeping into his bones" and foreclosed isolation. One tightening via dissolving wax converging voices; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard constrains rite (dew-kissed basin from boughs) and charges final image (city lights as "trapped emotions"); sensory hierarchy selective (rustle amplifies hush, wax glinting). Mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive via immersion) signaled early, textural escalation in bubbling voices to coherent prophecy narrowing self-knowledge; cost legible in mirrored loneliness forcing vow. Minor abstractness in prophecy scale vs. on-page internalization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of archived vs. lived emotions emerges organically via prophecy reweighting premise; final vow offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "sealing his fate."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in rune-embroidered robes and dead-tongue murmurs; rhythmic control modulates from hush to feverish quill scratches under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "velvet disquiet" motif, but minor overwriting in immersion ("tendrils... like dissolving oaths") muddles peak slightly; no loops, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic emotional archiving in skyscraper orchard yields inevitable prophecy turn; risky lyrical texture transforms trope without gimmickry.</comment>
