<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's scarred hands enable tender actions like brushing Lena's cheek, revealing contradictory gentleness amid hardness, with the bargain backstory anchoring his motivation to share vulnerably. Lena's presence forces micro-choices that earn her vow as closure. Minor label-speak ("gently skilled") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oriented early via Elias on ridge with box; sob incites kneel→share→enlighten under Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure as Charged Poise in Lena's vow and joint descent reconfigures pain-sharing with felt emotional cost in "scars to stars" image. One deepening via backstory tightens stake without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring celestial dance and scarred hands constrain solitude and charge final "binding scars to stars" image. Sensory gravel, shadows, pines filter through Elias's fire-lens bias. Ridge path guides interruption and descent as bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solitude for pain-translation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Lena's mirrored loss forcing share despite vulnerability. Agency in urging box-touch narrows isolation option; cost legible in etched pain lines and pride-yielding smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pain-as-universal-language emerges via box fissures shifting from personal loss to shared "howl of wind," answered non-literally in Lena's vow and ridge-bridge image without moralizing. Complexity in bargained innocence avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close Elias POV with fire-biased perceptual signature ("embers banked for dawn"); dialogue distinct—Elias gravelly reflective, Lena cracked whisper. Elevated diction ("celestial waltz") consistent but occasionally jars rustic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting with stacked figures ("silver vein," repeated "celestial dance") in reflective beats dulls density; minor loops like "cracked/cracking" and "hard softness" thrice create template cadence. Propulsion holds via varied rhythm, but artifacts drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Bargain-innocence via porcelain box transforms firefighter-redemption trope into textured universal-pain synthesis. Poetic celestial frame risks purple but coheres organically. Familiar girl-mentor arc elevated by irreplaceable fissures motif.</comment>
