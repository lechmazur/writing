<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motive roots in consistent savvy traits, compelling the ear-pressing choice with embodied awe; internal conflict emerges in theft-vs-warning reinterpretation. Micro-choices like tilting the jar reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: trait labels like "quietly savvy" slightly abstract competence without deeper flaw tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via light/flower motif density to CR closure: jar uncorked spills visions, reweighting theft as rebirth with flight cost legible in "savvy instinct urged flight." Orientation anchors early (emerald station, golden hour). One tightening: jar topples, glyphs bloom, narrowing to listen vs. steal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald station's jade arches pulse, constrain via concealed panel and light-mingling reveal; jar as micro-setting charges final train image. Sensory selective (amber fire to liquid jade). POV bias filters professionally (thief's vibrations sensed).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal for destiny murmurs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when jar reveals warning glyphs, forcing reinterpret listen with guards' footsteps cost. Agency in pressing ear forecloses thief path. Pressure coheres to charged poise on train.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reinterpretation unlocking destiny emerges via glyph-bouquet match to life-reframing whispers, final image ("wielded it") non-literally answers without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature luminous/selective ("vibrations only she sensed"). Rhythm modulates from mist-like stealth to rattling train cadence. Purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative density high in peak ("glyphs bloomed into flower-like patterns," "disbelief glowing") risks overwrite (-0.4); minor loops ("luminous disbelief," "reinterpret"). Rhythm varies, closure image clear. No scaffold obscures cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemist station's moonbeam jar transforms heist trope into CR epiphany, inevitable via flower codes buildup. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable light motif charges close.</comment>
