<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to seed innovation within constraints intensifies through doubt and calculation, compelling the final poised choice; interiority concrete in embodied turmoil like "heart pounding" and recalibration under gale. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses in doubt clawing amid fierce burn. Closure endurance earned by prior modeling causality, with kingdom's fate as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of models and frenzy builds to Charged Poise closure ("quill descended... transformation endured"), reconfiguring ignorance to seeded dawn with enforcers' approach as undeniable cost. Orientation anchored early in spire/lake. One tightening via enforcer horns narrows to precipice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via enforcer patrols on lake edge and spire's facets shaking in gale, charging final image ("spire humming... lake groaning"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (cartographic focus on chalk lattices, ice-cores). Details evolve causally, mirroring turmoil without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation sans defiance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through model frenzy and enforcer crunch to Charged Poise, foreclosing capture path with kingdom-collapse cost legible in "ice cracking" prophecy and boots below. Agency in recalibration under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation within chains emerges organically from model cascades and quill poise, final image ("uninkable yet inevitable") offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting constraint as forge, with conceptual cost in stagnation's shatter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in predictive, cartographic noticing ("lattices of probability"); voice texture distinct in iridescent rhythm modulating to intensity. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels but overwriting in peak frenzy ("feathers littering like fallen stars"; repeated "predictive") with minor metaphor density risks muddle; no loops obscure closure. Rhythm varies, anchors voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer mapping ignorance voids via grounded models transforms stagnation trope, with quill's poised descent as inevitable risk-heightening turn from particulars. No derivative echoes; commits to premise implications.</comment>
