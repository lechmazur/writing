<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft into community intensifies credibly through shared search and culminates in earned sculpture choice with embodied ache; contradictory yearning and residual isolation act in scene. Group secondaries apply relational pressure without dilution. Minor slip in repeated "boldly sympathetic" label slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tag pattern density builds group bonds to arbor discovery and reed sculpture as Charged Poise RR, with legible cost in "luminescent ache transformed—not erased, but shared." Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater. One tightening via deciphered migrations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard, mists, and obsidian arbor constrain search paths and charge final sculpture image, mirroring internal webs. Sensory selection (pulsing glow, frost-kissed) reflects Elara's sympathetic bias. Details evolve causally with group progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft via search) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as group swells and tags lead to arbor, narrowing isolation options with felt endurance cost. Agency in Elara's initiation and final knot. Enters 8+ via trade-off legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring kinship emerges organically from tag webs to reed canopy, final arbor image reweighting ache as shared bond without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonance from imperfect ties lingers. No thematic echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (ache as glowing, glyphs as kinship calls); diction/rhythm poetic yet biased to Elara's sympathy. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I seek the artist's mark"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene cadence, high density integrates image/action; purposeful motif repetition ("webs," "ache") avoids loops. Minor overwriting in stacked figuration (e.g., "webs of kinship radiating in bold, interlocking spirals") slightly muddles peak without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis of quest-as-communion transforms tropes via reed grafting and obsidian monument; fresh angle on belonging through tag mystery. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes.</comment>
