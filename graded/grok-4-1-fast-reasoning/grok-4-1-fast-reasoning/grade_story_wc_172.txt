<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between amorality and sentiment drives release, embodied in "whispered to it nightly" and tears; earned change via prior drought-map causality. Minor slip: backstory summaries slightly abstract motivation before full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from survey to egg placement; Charged Poise closure in storm's spatter and "lightening his step" with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored in opening line; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt flat's cracks constrain path to hollow, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (crunch, wind sigh, thunder) reflects POV urgency. Mirrors internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via egg) signaled early, deepens via map-tracing to release under accumulative lens; agency in placement forecloses secrecy path with tears as cost. Lacks one live option foreclosure for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of veiled redemption emerges organically from drought-to-rivers image shift; final storm reweights premise without moralizing. Resonant counter-reading in "laundering guilt into gold."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in fractured imagery; voice modulates rhythm to pressure peak. No dialogue; minor register elevation in reflections borders POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density but overwriting artifacts: figurative density pervades release beat ("fractured grace" loops, mixed vehicles like "dried heart/pip"); paraphrase churn in final litany dulls propulsion. Paragraph test fails on ending summaries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-map for extinct egg redemption transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure image. Inevitable in hindsight from huia backstory seed.</comment>
