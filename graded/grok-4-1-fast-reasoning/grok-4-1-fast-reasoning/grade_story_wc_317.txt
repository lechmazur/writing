<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's receptive trait and motivation to protect his venue drive consistent micro-choices like planting the seed and crushing a flake, earning the final vow. Interiority particular to puzzle-solving mind, with embodied curiosity via brook-lapping rhythm. Minor slip: abstract "internal conflict" summaries dilute peak decoding tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orthogonal pivots build density to CR closure where seed reconfigures from threat to ally, cost felt in prior sabotage fear (e.g., "developer's ploy?"). Orientation anchored early (Elias at brook post-mail). One tightening via olfactory cipher unearths drive with legible payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brookside haven constrains choices (plants seed there, unearths drive from loam); petrichor, lapping waters, moonlight filter through puzzle-biased POV, charging final sprouting image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under reflective urgency. No slips; micro-setting elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard venue) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pivots narrowing threat options to genesis reveal. Agency in decoding tests commitment; cost legible in foreclosed developer sabotage. One deepening (UV-reveal coordinates) forces triumphant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of orthogonal innovation emerges organically from pivots and seed's shift, resonating in final "innovation's silence roared triumphant" without moralizing. Returning brook/flow images reweight creativity's vulnerability. Complexity in misdirection embrace lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature puzzle-attuned (e.g., etchings as "micro-map"). Rhythm modulates with intensity; purposeful compression in pivots legible under Accumulative lens. Minor: occasional elevated diction borders register drift in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High figurative density (e.g., "velvet hush," "storm-born silence") borders overwriting in decoding beats without crisp payoff, dulling propulsion; motif loops ("hush," "flow," "brook") repeat without tightening. Rhythm varies but template stems ("He [pivoted/turned]") in approaches. Density functional but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse seed as orthogonal puzzle delivering legal salvation transforms escape-room tropes organically. Risky lyrical structure heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via proprietor lens. No derivative echoes.</comment>
