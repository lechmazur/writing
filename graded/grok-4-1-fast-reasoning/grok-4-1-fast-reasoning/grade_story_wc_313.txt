<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's guilt-driven vigilance and precisely humane choices culminate in earned sharing and burning, with contradictory impulses (duty vs. buried fault) embodied in the trail-following compulsion; Mira applies timely pressure as secondary. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "flooded back" during memory reveal slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via trail's density build to memory crest and Mira's arrival, delivering RR closure in lantern burning with felt cost of aired guilt foreclosing solitary hush; one tightening at overlook photo suffices. Orientation anchored early in patrol setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sapphire label and mud-glints constrain trail choices and charge final framing image; recurring hush/mirror subtly mirrors internal resurfacing without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy narrows to glints/pulse in crisis, evolving causally with dusk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guilt vs. vigilance signaled in eroded levee patrol, tightening accumulatively through photo trail to memory flood and Mira encounter, forcing stance crystallization in shared burning with relational cost. Agency in weaving tale narrows solitary endurance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shared stories mending floods emerges organically from trail events and burning, with final sapphire-framed photo offering non-literal answer to isolation vs. binding memory; ambiguity in "expunge is not to erase" invites counter-readings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hushed, mirroring diction biased to warden's vigilance; voice modulates rhythmically from patrol calm to deepened pulse under memory stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, pursuing goal of shared meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but hush/mirrored loops and paraphrase redundancy (e.g., repeated "hush deepened, mirroring") across adjacent lines create minor template cadence in buildup, docking -0.4; no closure touch. Rhythms vary read-aloud effectively otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resurfacing ghosts via photo trail transforms guilt trope into story-spinning redemption; risk in lyric hush accumulation heightens emotional stakes organically. Non-obvious moral calculus of humane expunging feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
