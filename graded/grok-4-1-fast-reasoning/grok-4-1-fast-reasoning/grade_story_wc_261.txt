<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied doubt flickering pre-tunnel and scar-thirst compelling wound-reopening; final scar-tracing realization earned via causal buildup without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in probing coffee rings amid physical hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of scar-images, telepathy, and tunneling culminate in on-page CR (letters reveal fault) with legible cost (bleeding fingers, memory flood); orientation anchored in opening lines, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tower's ivy and subterranean dirt constrain tunneling choice via plant guidance; frost-cracking hourglass and coffee rings charge final thawed sands image, filtering through Elena's scar-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant scar-reading stake signaled early, escalates via telepathy/coffee confirmation to agency-driven tunnel (reopens wound); cost unmistakable in "fingers bled into the earth" and "memories flooding like groundwater," reweighting under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-narratives emerges implicitly from tunnel revelation without statement; final "tracing her scar; she could read it now" reconfigures premise non-literally, embracing complexity of wounds birthing wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with hushed perceptual signature (scar whorls, verdant rustle) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in tunnel's "each grain's whisper," no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel tunneling beat, but minor overwriting in figurative density ("meteor hush amplifying each grain's whisper") strains clarity without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-telepathy "displaced miracle" and coffee-ring divination transforms scar-trope organically; risk in lyric hush-heightens stakes to inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
