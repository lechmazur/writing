<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession drives all micro-choices like stylus-tracing and loop-closing, earning revelation; interiority concrete in "obsession burned steady" and heartbeat-sync, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with knowledge density building via sequential loop-closures to holographic map CR; cost legible in "hours blurred in nocturnal vigil"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully: levitation crystals moan winds constraining vigil, pedestal's rune-lock enables action, observatory hums approval charging final image; sensory hierarchy scholar-biased toward glyphs and star-ink.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' path) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via third automaton's resistance forcing persistence; agency in methodical loop-closing forecloses ignorance with time-cost, visible in "hours blurred."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bent-reality harmony emerges organically from relearning loops birthing night anew; final holographic map and faint smile offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting noon shadows without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rune-etched details and shadow motifs; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate ("slow, measured rotations") to blurring intensity; diction fits scholar without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "gears unseen stirred, a low chime resonating like noon bells muffled by fog" advancing action and image; minor paraphrase loops in shadow descriptions ("pooling... funneled... nourished") dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spoon-Bending chaos, rune-loop mechanics, and shadow-noon vaults transforms fantasy tropes; risk in elliptical Accumulative closure heightens conceptual stakes via "relearn what noon conceals."</comment>
