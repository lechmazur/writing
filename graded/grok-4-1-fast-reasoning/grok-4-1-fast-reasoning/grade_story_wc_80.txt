<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive nature embodied in endurance amid tears lost to flood and precise note-writing under strain; motivation to archive dreams drives micro-choices like etching ancestral namesake. Internal contradiction shines in facade cracking during pillar wrestle. Earned change to archeologist identity via repeated repairs seals pivotal closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rising tide density tightens pressure through deepening revelations and repairs. Orientation anchors immediately in causeway/drawbridge setup. Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in final note/capstone placement with physical exhaustion cost, reconfiguring his surveyor role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion and rising water constrain every repair choice, from knee-lapping to chest-high vise; lantern shadows and kelp-draped domes charge sensory immersion. Inkwell as micro-setting enables note method. Final surfacing image reweights environment's threat into enduring legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair/archive vs. tide) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via leg-pinning undertow and ink depletion narrowing options. Agency in wrestling stones forces trade-offs with embodied cost (lungs aflame). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interlaced absence theme emerges organically from etchings-cracks to note-sealed foundations, reweighting abandoned dreams in final capstone missive. Resonant non-literal answer in pavilion's subtended endurance avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in solitude's quiet pyre.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: waves as jealous ghosts, stone voids as severed promises. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically with tide's intensity. No head-hopping; diction fits stoic sensitivity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting with figurative language in every high-pressure sentence (e.g., "hushed blaze," "restrained embers") violates density check, dulling propulsion during repairs. Paraphrase loops in "interlaced absence"/"severed promises" and template cadence in repetitive "wrestled" beats obscure cause/effect. Closure image muddled by stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-archeologist via note-in-mortar method transforms erosion trope into legacy-seeding ritual. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in solo tide-battle. Irreplaceable pavilion notes create inevitable hindsight resonance.</comment>
