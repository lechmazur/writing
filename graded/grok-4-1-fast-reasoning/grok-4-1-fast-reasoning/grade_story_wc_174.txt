<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in bar show memory ("audience laughter turning uneasy") vs dome clarity compel reversal; "thrill of control" flaw complicates ethical probe with visible career cost; minor diagnostic slips in epiphany phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via hush/reverse/epiphany density to CR closure ("puppets dismantled... strings severed for good") reconfiguring motivation with opportunity cost legible in shed "subversive thrills"; single tightening via stick reversal; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome walls amplify breath ("mimicking the meteor hush") constrain introspective pivot, radar metaphor scans "soul's horizon"; final "dome faded behind, a husk echoing transformed resolve" charges image; sensory hush/lantern purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant ethical stake signaled early tightens texturally when reverse stick deepens "half-lit epiphanies" to "crystallized" renunciation; protagonist agency forecloses bar path, cost unmistakable in "no more seedy bars' subversive thrills".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of subversion vs grace emerges organically from stick reversal and bar cruelty memory; resonant non-literal answer in whispered "Half-lit no more—full dawn" reweights prior probes without moralizing, prior scars ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tracing "looping calligraphy", hush bias) modulates rhythm from serene hush to pivoting cadence; stable limited POV, purposeful pattern-taught repetition legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful hush motif repetition taught early propels to closure without obscuring; figurative language dense in reflections but coherent lyric mode; minor template cadence in serenity paraphrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reverse-reading stick ingeniously fuses calligrapher trait with ethical reversal, transforming puppet trope via dome isolation; fresh synthesis risks poetic intensity, inevitable hindsight pivot heightens stakes.</comment>
