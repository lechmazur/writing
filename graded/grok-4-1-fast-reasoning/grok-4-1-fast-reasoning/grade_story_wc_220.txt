<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in leaf-clutched ache intensifies to trek despite rust, earning shift to shared life-hunt with Mira's scarred reveal as pivotal cost-bearing change. Contradictory impulses (retirement vs. nose-primed pull) act in pacing the shack and final hand-squeeze. Flaws like faint decay scent complicate reunion without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cylinder from Harlan accumulates to riddle solution → trek ellipsis → rift-lip reunion as Charged Poise RR with cost in her changes. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard/shack. One tightening via riddle reweights Mira's absence into location.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cracked wasteland/rifts constrain trek across catwalks, charging final hand-in-hand walk amid settlement lights. Sensory hierarchy via bloodhound nose (rust, decay) filters urgency; details like fuselage shack integrate into action. Recurring cracks mirror/theme mend without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distance to closeness) signaled via leaf ache, tightens accumulatively through riddle-deepening to flawed reunion cost (haunted changes foreclose perfect unity). Agency in solving/trekking narrows solo path. Rift lip forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of flawed mending emerges from leaf/cylinder/riddle particulars, reweighted in "leaf's preservation was lie-tint" realization without moralizing. Final catwalk image answers closeness question via authentic bloom amid cracks. Subtext in Mira's laugh handing new cylinder lingers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elias's nose/perception signature (decay bouquet); voice texture poetic/repetitive ("wild hush") taught early as lyric pattern. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (her whisper confirms solve). Rhythm modulates trek tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Purposeful motif repetition ("wild hush," "tinted") builds texture without loop penalty; density high in images like "veined amber glowed." Minor paraphrase in revelation lines ("tinted revelations") dulls slightly but props closure. Propulsion varies rhythmically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: micro-script riddle in cylinder grooves transforms post-apoc tropes via bloodhound solving → body-hunter pivot. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without opacity. Inevitable hindsight from leaf-riddle echo.</comment>
