<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's adaptable, warmly methodical traits compel the climax merge with embodied calm (pulse quickens but ledger noted), revealing hierarchy of values through patient unweaving over panic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from anomalous door to seal-rope merge delivers DC closure with reconfiguration cost (rope pulses warmly, door fades); post-merge word-count loops slightly obscure final image legibility without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory anchors like "oiled gears and aged dust" and tactile rope braids constrain the reconfiguration choice, charging the harmonious hum in the mechanism room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to resolve anomaly tightens via braid unweaving revelation, forcing merge agency with felt cost (fibrous nexus warmth, fluttering pages) under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Absence-to-presence theme emerges organically from fables mandala and seal integration, resonating in "absence woven into presence" without moralizing, though meta ending slightly dilutes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with archival perceptual bias (humming folk tunes, ledger precision); murmurs natural, but minor post-closure meta drifts from voice texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ending plagued by paraphrase loops ("clarity achieved... confusion eternally clarified," multiple "wait" recounts) and synonym churn dull closure propulsion; figurative density strains in merge beat ("blood returning to stone").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh archival anomaly via starlight-threaded rope and absence fables transforms trope discovery into ingenious timeline-binding climax.</comment>
