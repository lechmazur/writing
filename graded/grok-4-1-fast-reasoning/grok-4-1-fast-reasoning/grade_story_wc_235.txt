<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of jealousy toward past selves act simultaneously in the gripping of the scroll and ignition of flight; final merge into guides earns change with embodied cost of jaded resolve. Interiority concrete via scents and frost; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of visions builds to soaring reconfiguration; closure lands as Charged Poise in folded scroll and lingering question, with conceptual cost of cyclic graves legible in "whose grave would I chronicle next?" Orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll as micro-setting constrains writing mid-flight and charges final tuck into pack; cabin's creaky bunk and peak crags mirror internal chaos without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jealousy method signals dominant stake early, tightening via surge into soaring that narrows rivalry into merger under accumulative lens; cost felt in leveled glide and ongoing "for now" sating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grave as rebirth marker emerges organically from scroll phrases and merged selves, reweighting jealousy without moral; resonant final image answers thematic question of buried freedoms non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "jaded wonder" and dream-chronicler bias sustains first-person stability; rhythmic modulation peaks in "erupting upward through the cabin roof," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Purposeful "feral nostalgia" recurrence teaches pattern without loop penalty; high density in flight sequence propels, though minor metaphor density in ascent slightly slows peak without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves as lucidity method synthesizes fresh angle on dreaming; bark scroll and chronological flights transform tropes organically, risking bold texture payoff in merge.</comment>
