<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation as historian of small gestures compels ritual choices with ruthless severance of shadow, embodied in "benevolently ruthless" trade-off; internal conflict surfaces in flooding memories during "Clench" but yields to higher archive. Minor abstraction in emotions slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through layered word-spellings (flicker→unbind), culminating in on-page RR closure: penumbra stripped and absorbed into chessboard with conceptual cost to wholeness ("stripping the penumbra from Thorne's soul"). Lens holds cleanly; persistent gallery constraint shapes tactics to finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's acoustics and curve constrain walking-pattern choices, amplifying whispers to fray penumbra; oculus light and marble dust charge final kneeling image. Sensory selection (visual glow, auditory susurrus) filters via Thorne's gesture-obsessed POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind shadow to reclaim history-recording wholeness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via word-layers narrowing penumbra's cohesion to "unbind" climax; agency in ritual forecloses shadow-tether with felt cost ("mind flooding with unmoored memories" overridden ruthlessly).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked small gestures as history's pawns emerges organically via spelled words mirroring crisis trifles, reweighted in chessboard absorption and final record-keeping image without moralizing; resonant CR recasts luminous absence as triumphant void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature fixated on shadows/gestures; poetic diction/rhythm modulates from measured circling to "luminous gale," heightening pressure legibly. Experimental compression taught early in ritual pays off at unbound closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (luminous absence, nomadic penumbra) coherent under lyric pattern, propelling to closure without loops or muddle; minor overwriting in descriptive density during spelling beats doesn't obscure penumbra's fraying payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis-actor ritual, word-walking unbinding, and pawnless chessboard transforms shadow-self trope into inevitable historian rebirth; bold accumulative poise risks poetic density for charged, irreplaceable closure image.</comment>
