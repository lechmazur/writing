<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Phone-hurling climax earned by contradictory impulses of empirical calm surging against vulnerable entrapment parallels; embodied shiver and steady pulse particularize under pressure, minor label-speak ("fortified vulnerability") abstracts slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds vision density to charged poise closure in phone destruction and restraining order call; legible symbolic/relational cost in "digital leash tightening" to snapped bonds, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flooded tunnel pressures ladder climb and phone disposal in puddle, lantern as micro-setting charges final swinging image; sensory drip/rumble hierarchy reflects empirical POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Entrapment stake signaled early, deepens via memory density to agency in peak reverberation hurl; forecloses relational path with visible cost (sparking phone), coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entanglement theme emerges organically from lantern visions paralleling chains, final talisman image offers non-literal freedom answer reweighting observation-to-action without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with empirical perceptual signature ("cataloged the scene") modulating rhythmic surges in visions; purposeful elevation fits literary investigator voice, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels vision density to closure without loops; minor figurative density ("armor and wound") and repeated "empirically" purposeful but borders overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Subway repurposed from Underground Railroad via artifact/memories transforms escape trope freshly; bold historical-modern synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
