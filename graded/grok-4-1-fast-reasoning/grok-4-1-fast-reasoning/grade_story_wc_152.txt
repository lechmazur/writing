<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—feigning folly while sharply deducing the duke's fake starlogs—act simultaneously in her stitching and babbling, earning the final chart-slipping choice with visible risk of exposure. Interiority concrete via embodied pricks and giggles masking acuity. Motivation rooted in listening for unheard stories drives higher-stakes micro-choices under courier pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, threads, and flame pulses builds to Charged Poise closure in courier departure and flame's steady glow, reweighting deceit with her sent chart's cost (disguised risk). Orientation anchored early in observatory and Elara's toil. One tightening via phantom stars detection narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory and eternal candle constrain choices—flame synchronizes stitches to expose fakes, leaves echo as intruder footfalls heighten hush. Recurrent candle charges final image, affirming triumph. Sensory hierarchy (scratch of needle, chill seeping) filters through Elara's cosmic bias, vivid and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart coup via true chart) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through density of drifts and phantom stars to agency-driven tightening: slipping chart under courier's eyes forecloses duke's false mandate with felt disguise cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cloaked wisdom vs. deceit emerges organically from embroidery revelations and final chart's echo in royal ears, reweighting stellar truth without statement. Returning silence motif shifts from shroud to sentinel, charging closure image resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature: cosmic whispers and silk threads bias noticing. Lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure, compressing under courier ("spilling tea to mask"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Silly weather, rattling my poor bones!") pursues concealment goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("echoed silence" x3, autumn deepening) and repetitive feigning stems dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; metaphors coherent (threads as fates). Vivid specificity trumps overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wise fool as galaxy embroiderer unraveled via eternal flame transforms conspiracy tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens cosmic deceit stakes, inevitable in hindsight through adjacent possibilities' pattern.</comment>
