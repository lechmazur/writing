<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover truth intensifies through embodied vibrations in his chest, earning the dynasty-ending choice; interiority particular via acoustic attunement avoids stock epiphanies, though reflective musing borders BRR limit without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds from crank whir to wave convergence revealing panel; closure lands as CR via burning documents with legible conceptual cost in "flames leaping to devour the evidence," reweighting legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone constrain discovery through acoustic resonance and hidden panel; sensory hierarchy favors sound/shadows per Elias's bias, charging final image of silent gramophone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-seeking tightens accumulatively via waves narrowing to bookshelf panel; agency in cranking faster forces discovery with on-page cost of erasure in hearth blaze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of perfidy's acoustic unveiling emerges via particulars like overtones as cipher; final image of enduring gramophone offers non-literal resonance on legacy's end without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature attuned to waves/shadows; rhythmic texture modulates introspection to action without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud but dense figurative language persists into peak discovery beat ("standing waves converged"); patterned repeats like "eloquently silent" (4x) teach lyric mode without full clarity loss, though loops dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Standing waves as acoustic cipher for hidden panel transforms gramophone trope ingeniously; crank's evolution from tool to "scepter of reckoning" feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
