<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ties Elias's grief to empathetic silence interpretation, culminating in tears-blurred vision at parchments; micro-choices like sparing photos reveal guarded traits under pressure. Minor label-speak ("shielded openness defined") slightly abstracts interiority without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from map tear (inciting) through video sync to chapel descent, landing CR closure in map reframing with emotional cost legible in "tears blurring his vision—not rain, but release." Two clean shards with legible transition; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresco vault and henge constrain choices—damp chill steadies fingers, fissure demands clearing—with recurring rain-scoured motif charging final image; body/attention (loupe, flashlight) filters sensory hierarchy purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover whispered chapel via silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through video discrepancies narrowing site to fissure; agency in keystone press forecloses guarded isolation with felt emotional cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic silence emerges organically from map tear to chapel exhale, resonant in final reframed map where "known embraced unknown"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in pocketed letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cartographic whispers, hushed acoustics); rhythmic diction modulates from methodical to charged poise at "henge above thrummed"; no dialogue, elisions purposeful for textural hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in descriptive clusters ("rain-scoured fresco vault, its walls etched with faded saints") risks muddle pre-climax; purposeful "silence" repetition teaches pattern without loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map tear as portal and silent videos as seismic reveal transforms henge trope; risk in solo descent heightens personal stakes organically.</comment>
