<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shyly unstoppable trait embodies contradictory impulses in hesitant yet persistent rite; earned closure via pain's uncoiling shows motivation scaling with postcard discovery. Minor label-speak in "photosynthesize pain" lacks deeper embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of longing builds to RR/Charged Poise in postcard's ensconcement; cost legible in "centuries' longing cresting like a wave." Orientation anchored early in shell; one tightening via glint-to-rite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell constrains rite in spiral core amid glowing polyps; bioluminescent ink and off-key wind charge final images. Sensory details (nacre, coral moonlight) mirror internal transmutation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end insomnia via pain's beauty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through postcard rite narrowing wakefulness; agency in intoning forces pain's flowering with visible cost of torment's release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of pain photosynthesized into beauty emerges via particulars like crimson petals from sorrows; final postcard merge offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in reef-shadow joy veils ache organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture with rhythmic incantations ("shyly unstoppable") biases perception to bioluminescent transformation; stable single-POV filters all through Elowen's longing. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive short lines at end ("Blossom armistice... Joy in shadows") create paraphrase loops dulling closure propulsion; heavy figurative density borders overwriting in rite beat without varied rhythm. Strengths in vivid sensory propulsion earlier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-poet photosynthesizing cosmic postcard into sleep's armistice transforms insomnia trope; risk in lyric repetition heightens textual stakes inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
