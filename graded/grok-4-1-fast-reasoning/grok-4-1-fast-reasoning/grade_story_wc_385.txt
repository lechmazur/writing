<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elyra's perceptive trait roots motivation and drives micro-choices like gradual disclosures to counter intrigue; sensing merchant's "greed-laced pulse" reveals character under pressure. Limited simultaneous internal contradiction, but crystallization earns closure with isolation cost in walking alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seashell whispers and disclosures build density to merchant lunge as tightening; CR closure lands via realization "echoes persisted not by fate" with merchant sealed as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in nexus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nexus coils and starlight constrain choreography and charge shell's iridescence; shell as micro-setting enables whispers, pocketed in final image to reweight perception. Sensory weave (hum, winds, echoes) mirrors internal riddle without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo riddle/ensure pact) signaled early, escalates via whisper deepenings narrowing trust under accumulative lens; Elyra's disclosures force trade-off, lunge tests with sealing cost visible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of perception amplifying echoes emerges from whispers/particulars, final image of persistent voice reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from intrigue amplifying vs. pure hearts muffling avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (subtlest shimmers, pulse-sensing); lyrical rhythm modulates with hum's swell, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Webs tighten"). No head-hopping, diction biased to singer's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, motifs like "hum" propel without loops; minor paraphrase in repeated "melancholy winds" but purposeful for tone. No artifacts dull closure's departing song image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo lore, perception, and intrigue webs transforms fantasy tropes; shell's evolving whispers and perceptual closure feel inevitable from setup. Bold lyric accumulation risks pay off in CR without gimmick.</comment>
