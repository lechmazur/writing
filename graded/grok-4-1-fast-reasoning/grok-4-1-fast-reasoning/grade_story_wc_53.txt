<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's resolute scavenging drives micro-choices like forcing the jammed wheel, earning the negotiation with embodied regret (sweat, coiled gut); ghost confrontation reveals internal contradiction between chase and halt without tidy epiphany. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragment density builds chronologically confused regrets to ghost manifestation and pact (RR closure via wheel-offer, cost in vowed grounded hunts, "regretted not the carousel's halt, but never halting himself"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via jammed fragment ripples lagoon, spawning ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and lily pad constrain action (kneeling crank, ghost rising from depths); wheel as micro-setting charges final image, discarded spinning on pad capturing "nothing but sky." Sensory hierarchy (snicking wheel, rippling waters) mirrors erosion under scavenger bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost for reclaimed ambitions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening fragments narrowing to accusation ("You eroded us") and trade-off refusal ("No"), forcing wheel-offer agency with cost (resilient ambitions over sharp ones). Climax pact crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions vs. resilient release emerges via fragment mosaics reweighting endless spin; final descent ("dreams of solid ground") offers non-literal answer to chase-or-halt question, lingering ambiguity in "regret lingered, a faint click." No moralizing, complexity in ghost's forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (scavenger's ear for "whisper-shards," biased mosaic-piecing) with rhythmic lyric texture modulating to clarity; ghost dialogue sparse, subtextual ("Ghosts don't bargain; they haunt"). Compression taught early, legible at charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "Click" advances beats); varied rhythm, purposeful repetition ("regret," "click") without loops. Minor overwriting in opening swirl metaphors slightly muddles but spares closure; clean syntax under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal carousel-lagoon world with story-capturing wheel transforms regret tropes; risk-taking in nonlinear fragment polyphony heightens stakes, inevitable pact growing from particulars without gimmick.</comment>
