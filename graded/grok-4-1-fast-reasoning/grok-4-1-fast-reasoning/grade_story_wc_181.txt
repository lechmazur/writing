<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through surreal interiority ties to curator role, but epiphanies like "equations of eternity swirled down the drain" feel unembodied and label-reliant, softening pivotal engraving choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with imagery density tightening to CR closure ("live between the pages"); cost legible in chaos risk line; orientation anchored early, pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bathroom as micro-setting constrains breakthroughs (mirror-void pondering, echo whisper), orchard charges final image; sensory selection (spectral hum, crunched soil) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) deepens accumulatively via engraving beat narrowing options; agency in query-tracing, cost felt in "chaos might her engraving unleash."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nonlinear loops theme emerges organically from cameo visions and orchard pulse; final "weaver of loops" CR reweights without moralizing, lingering ambiguity on peril.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with surreal perceptual bias; syntax modulates intensity (short epiphany bursts); spirit dialogue subtextual, pattern-taught elision legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("brightened disquiet," "simply complicated") borders loop artifacts dulling peak engraving density; figurative pile-up coherent but heavy in bathroom beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pistachio cameo as nonlinear nexus transforms inheritance trope boldly; surreal synthesis (bathroom portals, asteroid orchard) feels inevitable, risks heighten conceptual stakes.</comment>
