<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voss's motivation shines in withholding direct explanation for trance demonstration, earning Elara's realization; traits like "silver hair over boyish shoulders" particularize him. Elara's embodied reactions (heart pounding, gasping) ground her shift, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: trance density builds to pebble toss and fading ripples delivering CR closure (Elara's grasp of vanishing prerequisite) with conceptual cost of patient surrender. Orientation anchors early (Elara on platform seeking Voss at twilight). One tightening via visions-to-patterns suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pond ripples and grotto constrain revelation tactic, charging final image of grotto's call; luminous moss, ferrous veins selective and POV-filtered through trance urgency. Atmosphere tensions serenity with magnetic pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversal) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through trance visions narrowing to surrender cost; agency in shared trance and watching patterns forecloses superficial pursuit. Ripples' delayed encoding tests commitment with patience price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth via ego-dissolution emerges organically from ripples encoding "vanish to appear," reweighting premise in final whisper without statement; ambiguity in haste's risk lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (hush-blended whispers, star-pricked waters); voice texture lush and consistent until artifacts disrupt. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("reversal demands vanishing first").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in trance beat ("fractal mandalas," repeated hush) violates coherence (−0.7); generation artifacts ("Wait, word count way over") and paraphrase loops (ripples/patterns reformulations) dull propulsion in final third (−1.0 total). Rhythm varies but scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ripple-encoded secret transforms backwards aging trope via grotto pull and vanishing rule; fresh synthesis of magnetic hum, starlit runes, and pebble method feels inevitable in CR.</comment>
