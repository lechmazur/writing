<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to reforge bond clear and intensifies through reluctance in metamorphosis; internal conflict embodied in "skin prickled, fur sprouting... resisted, claws forming". Repetition of "paradoxically steady" flattens particularity, making endurance feel labeled over dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fortune cookie incites, spice-gathering and rite build density to RR closure in reunion image with metamorphosis cost legible ("shedding humanity"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph's orchard/moonlight setup. Minor deus ex fortune cookie placement does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting's orchard provides spices constraining rite choices; scents and moonlight charge final nuzzle/reunion image. Sensory hierarchy (scent dominant) reflects whisperer's priorities and urgency. No white-room; lived-in via dew-kissed roots, griffin lairs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rite invocation narrowing to reluctant transformation under textural pressure. Agency in grinding/igniting spices forces trade-off (humanity for reunion), cost felt in "pain lanced... bones reshaping".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transcending death via sacrifice emerges from spice rite and beast-form reunion, final stag-wolf circle reweighting bond without moralizing. Cosmic intimacy motif shifts from memory to enacted intimacy organically. No tidy binary; reluctance adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lush perceptual signature (scent/stars in veins); voice modulates rhythm in climax compression ("Vapors rose... tendrils swirled"). No dialogue; purposeful poetic diction taught early, legible at closure. Perceptual bias beast-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in every climax sentence ("ethereal tendrils... nebulae", "antlers of starlight") dulls propulsion; "paradoxically steady" exact-repeat loop x4 creates template cadence touching closure para. Paraphrase redundancy in ending summaries ("forged anew... bonds transcended") drags momentum. Rhythmic variety present but undermined by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie prophecy in fairy orchard catalyzes phoenix-post rite; reluctant human-to-stag reconfigures tropes via spice-scent mechanics. Risky cosmic intimacy tone heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation test passes: elements interdependent.</comment>
