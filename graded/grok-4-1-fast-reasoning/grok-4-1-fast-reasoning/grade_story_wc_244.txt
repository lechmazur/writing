<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's desperately jocular trait embodies contradiction—quips shield solitude but crack into tears, compelling the rock-sharing choice that earns his mending; secondary characters like Mira apply reciprocal pressure without diluting his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor density and rock-passing exchanges build to RR closure ("heart mended, knowing the rock was mere catalyst") with legible conceptual cost of derailed isolation; orientation anchored early, one tightening via catalyzed bonds suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and crumbling arches constrain gatherings and mirror isolation-to-connection shift, recurring in final rustle to charge closure image; sensory selection (echoing laughter, lantern light) purposeful and POV-filtered through communal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Loneliness stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively through reciprocal exchanges narrowing solitary orbits; Elias's agency in seeding/sharing forecloses isolation with on-page cost felt in softened mask.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from rock-catalyzed exchanges, final image/quip ("moon dust could derail solitude") offers resonant non-literal repricing of bonds over artifacts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with communal perceptual bias, modulating rhythm for dusk urgency; sparse dialogue natural/subtextful ("laugh at its absurdity first"), polite anarchy idiom distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but "rumor chains" loops and adjacent paraphrases ("stories change/had changed") create minor scaffold drag; metaphors coherent, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moon rock as reciprocity catalyst transforms disaster-logistician trope into fresh communal cure, risk of whimsical anarchy heightens stakes organically; synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
