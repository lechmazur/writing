<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve stories via dust clear and intensifies broadcast choices; embodied emotions like "triumph prickled her skin like thistle barbs beneath velvet" reveal under pressure. Limited internal contradiction flattens peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust responses build density to CR closure ("famine receded... dust now told stories"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; looming pursuit provides felt cost in final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ember alcove and mist constrain hidden broadcast; dust motes as recurring object evolve to charge final orchestra vision, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful cloaked broadcast vs detection) signaled early; agency-driven tightening via dust response ("motes rose... swirling") and crackled reply narrows options, with drone pressure as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stories' endurance emerges organically from dust awakening and lyrics; final image ("dust veils dancing free") offers resonant CR reweighting famine premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (noting glows, motes, scores) stable in single POV; song lyrics carry subtextual goals, advancing plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in broadcast beats ("tendrils of fog curled like forgotten melodies") overwrites without payoff, dulling propulsion; repetitive "thistled calm" (4x) and "secretly luminous" (3x) create paraphrase loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate radio teaching dust stories transforms post-famine tropes; dust-to-orchestra progression feels inevitable from lyric seeds.</comment>
