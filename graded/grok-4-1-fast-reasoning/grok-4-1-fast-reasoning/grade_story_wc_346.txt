<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in vow drives climax effectively; interiority concrete via trembling hands and tracing patterns. Minor abstraction in "bruised awe filled him" slightly distances embodiment at peak memory flood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to singing; CR closure via crumbling puppet and easing clock lands with legible cost in "puppet head crumbling to dust in his arms."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pane of hush and puppet head as micro-settings constrain climax choice and charge final image; selective sensory details (chill seeping stone, dying light in eye) filter through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of final lullaby tightens via pattern-tracing to singing under Accumulative lens; agency forecloses isolation with cost in fading lighthouse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of flawed mercy emerges organically through nested patterns shifting to ghosts receiving lullaby; final image reconfigures isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns and hush; rhythmic modulation supports pressure in short, haunting lullaby lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figuration like "fractal veins"; minor overwriting in opening stacked metaphors ("dusk bled bruised purple") but no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock guardian and hush pane transforms doomsday trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via nested patterns payoff.</comment>
