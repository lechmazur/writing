<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait drives micro-choices across approximations, with embodied pangs ("hidden thorn piercing his quiet resolve") contradicting resolve yet compelling higher-stakes destruction; final reforging feels earned by accumulated failures without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying approximations (first brittle crack, second faint throb, third withered shoots) to decisive hurl into nexus core; closure DC lands on-page with cost of utter obliteration ("hammering followed, successive strikes pulverizing it").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains tactics (heating over embers, ember bath, core frenzy) and charges final thaw ("roots thawing the nexus ice"); selective sensory hush (crunching steps, fogging breath) mirrors internal stasis-to-spring without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to interrupt destiny) escalates accumulatively through three tightening failures narrowing to total destruction; agency peaks in "stoic precision" hurl, with legible cost in prior "failures accumulated like nexus snow" altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically via successive pulverizations, reweighting "preservation" failures; final tree image offers non-literal answer to stifling fate without moralizing, resonant with prior frozen blooms unfurling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature attunes to "latent whispers of holy ruin" and "tease of potential"; lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure image without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action ("grinding shards into powder with a pestle forged from nexus basalt"); minor register elevation in approximations ("successive approximation") doesn't obscure climax, though "stoic" variants repeat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical successive approximation and bishop's crozier yields inevitable "total creative destruction" turn; risk-taking in nexus micro-setting heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
