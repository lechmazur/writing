<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent traits and motivation propel micro-choices like repurposing the whisk for mending, earning the philosophical endurance at closure; interiority concrete and embodied in whisking rhythms, though lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses beyond serene observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tea froth to net repair; clear orientation by parapet/lagoon intro; CR closure via mended net and dimming fireflies reconfigures hidden effort premise with felt brevity cost in final whisking image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment constrains descent via moon paths and charges final lagoon contemplation; selective sensory details (rain beads, firefly glows) filter through Kai's philosophical bias, evolving with his path without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort deepens texturally through whisk-to-mend progression, narrowing to nocturnal revelation; agency in whistling and descent forecloses inaction with time-passing cost legible in fireflies fading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of concealed labor emerges organically from particulars like net snarls and tea vortices; final whisking image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, though early "net of creation" murmur borders direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with philosophical perceptual signature modulates rhythmically; stable close-third POV biases toward patterns in nature; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but overwrought figuratives ("vortices spun like miniature galaxies") in most sentences dull peak mending beat; minor synonym churn on "patterns" and "hidden" loops phrasing without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending as philosophical ritual with firefly escort transforms sage trope; risk in whisk-as-tool and moon-path navigation heightens ingenuity, feeling inevitable at final triumph image.</comment>
