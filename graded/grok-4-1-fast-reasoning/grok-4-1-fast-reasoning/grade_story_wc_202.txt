<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to honor histories roots consistently in childhood pebble trade and intuitions of drowned sailors, compelling the final whisper "Release the overlooked"; interiority embodied in heart racing and fragment's tug, with change earned as power surges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds stall-to-stall via painting revelations tightening intuition; closure as RR in "Power unbound, it projected holographic annals" with felt cost of lifelong bind released, pattern taught early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Market's dangling stalls and canvases constrain choices, guiding scans; paintings' hidden runes charge final unfastening image, sensory details (vaporous lanterns, wind whispers) filtered through Elara's translator bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind fragment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as each rune narrows veils toward surge; agency in scanning/whispering forecloses bind with cost legible in "visions cascaded," forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming overlooked histories emerges via painting symbols shifting to holographic annals etching souls; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant answer to silenced tales.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (half-remembered dreams, liminal seas); lyrical diction/rhythm modulate from timeless setup to surging climax, no head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative stacking ("lightning forked like veins," "jeweled spiderwebs") in peak scanning beats borders overwriting without muddle; minor "eternal instant" reprise risks template feel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist market, phasing lens unlocking paintings transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking in "eternal instant" time-blend heightens lyric stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
