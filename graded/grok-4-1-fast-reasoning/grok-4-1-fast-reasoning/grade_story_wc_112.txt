<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to prove sideways time roots consistently in repairs and data, compelling the lever pull with vindication as earned change. Interiority concrete via fractal wing patterns, though emotions lean poetic over deeply contradictory. Dr. Lirren's skepticism adds relational pressure without muddling single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from nexus setup to activation, landing Conceptual Repricing in "Subdued awakenings rippled outward" with cost of reconfigured memories and eternal now. Orientation anchors early (station, Elara, twilight by para 2). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hush of wings at rest and icy-warm nexus constrain timing/activation, charging final image of "station hummed with newfound rhythm." Sensory hierarchy (auditory hush, thermal clash) reflects mechanic's priorities, integrated via action. Atmosphere tensions doubt to revelation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drone repair weave-in to lever pull, narrowing to proof with changed reality cost. Agency in activation forecloses doubt, charging colleagues' gasps. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sideways time theme emerges organically from wing fractals and nexus projections, resonating in final "wings destined to beat sideways forevermore" without statement. Subtext in obliging facade vs. obsession invites ambiguity on vindication's price. Particulars (hush folding echoes) reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mechanical whir, fractal runes bias). Voice texture modulates poetically, diction controlled (servos, iridescent alloy). Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("Trust me" reassures under duress). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Artifact intrusion at closure ("trim to fit... Word count finalized... Wait, no meta") dulls final image with scaffold/meta-churn, triggering −1.7 cap for touching closure beat. Repetitive "hush"/"twilight" loops atmospheric pattern but verge paraphrase (−0.4). Figurative density overwrites activation without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobio wings proving sideways time via holographic nexus transforms time-travel trope through mechanic's lived repairs. Risky lyric build to CR feels inevitable, no template echoes. Bold icy-warm motif heightens stakes organically.</comment>
