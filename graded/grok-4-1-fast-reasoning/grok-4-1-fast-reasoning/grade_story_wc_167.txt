<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to illuminate mundane value roots consistently in glazier traits, embodied in hands tracing fractures; interior conflict surfaces in doubts read via ripples, earning resolve without tidy epiphany, though reflective blocks approach 20% BRR ceiling without always tilting present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ripple visions and prisms builds to Charged Poise closure in "pond stilled once more, rings dissolved into clarity," reconfiguring stance with felt cost of glimpsed tempest; orientation anchors early in Pearl Bay dawn; single scene with descent transition fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism atrium and pond micro-setting constrain communion choice and charge final image as "testament," with sensory hierarchy (mist bends light, dew-kissed stones) filtered through glazier bias; fog and dawn fog pressure subtle tactics without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking clarity before shift signaled early, escalates texturally via ripple spirals revealing rifts, narrowing to endurance resolve; agency in stone toss and murmuring forces trade-off with cost legible in "winds howling, hulls splintering" vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mending mundane fractures emerges organically from glazier acts and ripple patterns, resonating in final atrium image without moralizing; subtext in noctilucent glow reweights premise, inviting ambiguity on resilience's scale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with glazier perceptual signature (illusions in glass/fog) and rhythmic modulation under realization pressure; diction purposeful and biased, prose texture distinct without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but patterned repetition of "read between the lines" (3x) and minor paraphrase loops in ripple descriptions dull propulsion slightly; metaphors cohere around light/refraction without muddle in peak communion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism-pond divination synthesizes glazier craft into fresh occult method, transforming mundane harbor into resonant frame; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off inevitably at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
