<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly through embodied pruning and exhaling, earning her acceptance; contradictory impulses surface in trembling hands during the severance-symbolizing cuts. Hiroshi applies precise pressure as tutor without dominating. Minor slips in stock phrasing like "heart severed" slightly abstract interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds motif density to Charged Poise closure where compass reveals cerulean blue, reconfiguring regret with felt cost in tears and diffused petals. Single scene anchors orientation early ("breezy islet," Elara post-Tomas). Lens holds cleanly to ending image of "luminous forgiveness unspoken."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded garden and bonsai galleon constrain choices (pruning regrets, aligning compass), charging final nod of leaves. Sensory details like "pebbled shore" and "salt spray" filter through Elara's bias, mirroring soul's ache. Weather (post-rain glistens) evolves subtly with diffusion motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of apologies) signaled early tightens accumulatively via visions flooding and exhaling apologies, narrowing to inward-pointing needle with trade-off cost in foreclosed grief. Agency in micro-choices like snipping limbs drives escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Diffusion of regrets emerges organically from pruning and tides imagery, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: cerulean as "luminous forgiveness unspoken" reweighting loss. Complexity lingers in "peace amid sorrow" without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (tides/sea bias) modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtextual (Hiroshi's chants guide without explaining). Minor repetition in syntax converges voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Exact phrase repeats ("rhythmically placid" thrice, "slow-spoken" multiple) create template cadence obscuring climax propulsion; heavy metaphor density ("phantom winds," "incense scattering") muddles visions beat. Paraphrase loops on regrets/diffusion dull density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai as galleon with lace-woven instructions transforms apology quest into textured voyage; risk in lyric motif density heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
