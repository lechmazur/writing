<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied longing (heart clenched at sanctuary memory) and micro-choices (rigging projector, prism shortcuts) earn the final assembly/play; minor label reliance on "strategically creative" slightly undercuts interior contradiction in pivotal discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: reel discovery → map memory → navigation → refuge arrival with clock chime as RR closure; cost legible in "final surge nearly swept him" and frozen time thawed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal surges and prism-leaves constrain climbs and illuminate ladders, charging final glade where "compasses steadied"; selective sensory hierarchy (briny gusts narrowing to pulsing flowers) mirrors resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach grove for Lira encore) tightens via map-enabled path against tides; agency in "wedging into crevice" forecloses fall with felt physical/emotional cost charging clock's shudder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Defying fate through music reweights unreliable compasses/clock via film illusions and chime; resonant non-literal closure in "whisper echoed—her voice, unplanned, eternal" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (musical metaphors like "arbor groaning like colossal organ"); rhythmic control modulates from wistful dances to steely peaks without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor motif loops ("steely longing," "horizon invites night") create template cadence in journey beats without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloudsea arbor, subliminal film-map, and music-time defiance transforms lost-love quest; risk in makeshift projector/piano heightens stakes organically.</comment>
