<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patience embodied concretely in pivotal demos like "knuckles blanched white" against the match burn compels the seal, earning the final step onto the map; interiority particular via pulse-syncing to Eira's beats avoids stock phrasing. Minor abstraction in emotional layering prevents 9+ as impulses feel harmonious rather than contradictory in crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup from plate discovery to pattern assembly, tightening to ignition cascade as RR/Charged Poise; cost legible in "tears freezing on cheeks" foreclosing loss into direction. Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Discarded refuse (bones, cans, cores) as palette constrains pattern creation and charges final dome image; sensory selection (hoarfrost glint, wind-whipped ice) reflects alchemist's priorities, integrated into action without stalls. Body/environment interplay elevates, e.g., sweat in chill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heartbeat translation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through encoding pulses into patterns then seal's deepening revelation; agency in patient assembly narrows to map's path with felt cost in endurance/tears. One tightening sufficient, charges poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss transmuted to direction emerges organically from ephemera-to-eternal map; final image ("stepped onto the map's edge") reweights "moving stillness" without moralizing, resonant via particulars like glowing scars on plate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (alchemical traceries, phantom beats); rhythmic texture modulates intensity, e.g., compression in ignition cascade; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in cascade ("controlled cascade blooming outward"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, motifs like "holding its breath" purposeful. Dense figuration in peak seal risks minor overwrite (−0.4), but no loops/artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of refuse alchemy mapping soul-migration transforms loss trope; risk in "flash-paper" mechanics heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via plate-to-talisman arc.</comment>
