<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—barbs laced with warmth, backwards tic exposing vulnerability—earn Kai's resilience at sigil; past exile anchors motivation without flattening pressure. Kai reactive but gains credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tea geometry predicts fracture risk, triggers shadow trap inciting test, resolves in sigil DC with Elara's felt isolation cost ("Alone, she turned to her shards"). Orientation anchored first paragraph; single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Forgotten library's shards and glass pane constrain shadow echo-binding, charging release; swing motif frames hush, mirroring exile fragility without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile stake signaled early tightens via shadow complication, Kai's sigil agency forecloses permanent drift with legible cost in Elara's pacing nerves; causal escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilience forged through combative tenderness emerges organically from annotation trials and final gruff nod; ending image reweights mentoring's quiet cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Elara biases perception to shards/echoes; dialogue subtext sharp ("Backwards steps sharpen..."), distinct voices; rhythmic diction sustains poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motif density (shards, swing, geometry) purposeful but overwrites high-pressure shadow beat with stacked figs ("pulsing faintly like a caged echo"); minor paraphrase loops on "combative tenderness" dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors binding echoes transforms exile trope freshly; tea geometry as causal key and backwards tic synthesize uniquely, risking vulnerability for closure charge.</comment>
