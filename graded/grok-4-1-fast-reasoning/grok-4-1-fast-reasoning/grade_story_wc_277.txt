<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's devoted observation drives pivotal micro-choices like catching Thorne's "flicker of deceit," earning her logic-led intervention; repeated diagnostic labels like "solemn playfulness" slightly undercut embodiment in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with journalist call triggering Thorne's arrival, contradiction proof as tightening turn, and CR closure in confession reconfiguring legacy; cost legible in "regrets receding like spent comets."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echoing dome amplifies Thorne's "voice booming" and "echoing defeat," charging confrontation; observatory above clouds subtly mirrors orbiting regrets without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hidden truths escalates causally via Elara's proof sketch narrowing Thorne's lie options; agency in "nib tracing intersecting line" forces confession with relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orbits motif reweights from personal regret to redeemed legacy in final descent image; "Truths hide in contradictions" borders thematic echo but emerges organically from proof beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with star-biased perception like "nib glinting like a captured star"; dialogue subtextual in Elara's "let's orbit this claim," though elevated diction occasionally drifts from spoken rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "orbits of regret" motif across beats creates paraphrase loops dulling density in reflective openings; overwriting with stacked figures like "solemn symphonies" burdens high-pressure drawing scene without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical observatory for logical "proof by contradiction" transforms investigative trope; pen nib as star-piercing tool feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
