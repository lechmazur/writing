<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's confident uncertainty embodies contradictory impulses, constraining edits with caveats like pausing amid realignments; final pocketed pen endurance forecloses total fix with felt persistence of doubt. Interiority concrete via embodied gravity strains; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wrong seeds cause anomaly, pen unbend enables edits, therefore progressive softening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "new contingencies, like a lover's glance averted." Orientation anchors in opening lines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly constrains grasping ("arm feel leaden and featherlight") and charges final image of "reformed gardens"; sensory hierarchy (ozone smell, pulsing glow) filters through Elara's priorities. Details evolve causally with edits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning, fix anomaly) signaled early, tightens via deepening edits narrowing to balanced contingencies; agency in successive inscriptions forecloses paths with "demanded balance." Cost visible in reshaped memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of revision via contingencies emerges organically from edit ripples, reweighting mistakes as revelation; final "peculiar solace" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from ethical calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("whispers from distant quasars"); rhythmic texture modulates from chaotic flux to steady hum. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at pen's "warm against her hip."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images ("vines retracting slightly"); purposeful motif repetition ("confidently uncertain") avoids loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("floating thickets, hesitant moth") slightly dulls peak edit beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi anomaly with history-editing pen transforms tropes via contingent ethics; risk in poetic causality heightens stakes, inevitable in "edits demanded balance."</comment>
