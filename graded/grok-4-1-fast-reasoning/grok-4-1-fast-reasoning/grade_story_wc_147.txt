<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under oxygen pressure reveal hierarchy of values (duty over survival); vial's memories fuel earned change from panic to resolve. Minor flaw: idealized competence slightly mutes blind spots in peak unsnarling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of knots/memories tightens to RR closure (orb claimed amid critical gauge), with legible cost in overridden instincts and final ascent image. Orientation anchored early; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Biomes (coral arches, polyps) and tools (knife, gauge) constrain choices, charge final orb grasp; sensory filter (sapphire hues, swirling currents) mirrors internal hush, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness hush before oxygen ends) signaled early, tightens via vial-enabled unsnarling that forecloses ascent option; cost visible in shrieking alarm during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral-to-eternal emerges organically from vial memories and orb; final "hush's embrace" reconfigures solitude into splendor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward "lonesome splendor"; rhythmic modulation accelerates in unsnarling, diction purposeful and biased to diver's reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere; "lonesome splendor" motif purposeful without loop excess. Minor figurative density in peak beats risks slight overwrite but supports lyric drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hush/vial/temple transforms trope dive-quest via memory-overriding mechanic; risk in abstract "hush" pays off in irreplaceable closure image.</comment>
