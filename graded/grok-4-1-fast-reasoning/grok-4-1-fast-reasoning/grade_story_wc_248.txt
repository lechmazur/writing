<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like piecing the self-portrait slashes, earn the closure's guardian shift with felt grief cost. Minor slip in repetitive "volcanic tenderness" phrasing borders stock, but doesn't flatten pivotal intuition-driven turns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: clue density builds from figurine arrow to tapestry map, culminating in Charged Poise RR at vault sculpture with eternal guardianship cost legible in "warming the cold archive forever." Orientation anchored immediately; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "faintly warm" paints and "humid air thick with aged wool" filter through Elara's pattern-seeking POV, constraining path (loose panel) and charging final marble embrace image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early escalates accumulatively via deepening clue discoveries narrowing to vault; agency in intuition-driven follows forecloses paths with emotional cost peaking in vault sobs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of art-preserving love amid commodified ruin emerges organically from trail particulars, answered non-literally in final "threads of fate binding past to her unyielding heart" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in chaos) and rhythmic modulation; poetic texture purposeful, though minor overwriting in metaphors slightly dulls peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but metaphor overload ("volcanic tenderness" x4+, lava/erupting cluster in discovery beats) creates coherence dip and paraphrase loops (portray/repeated sobs), dulling closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-quest via Theo's art-trail codes transforms lost-love trope; "vandalized self-portrait" puzzle turn feels inevitable from established intuition.</comment>
