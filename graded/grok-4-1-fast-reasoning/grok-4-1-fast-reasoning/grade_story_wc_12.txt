<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via escalating loops, compelling higher-stakes rhetoric that earns stasis; palette emptying as felt cost in final rise. Strength: micro-choices like stomping pedal reveal value hierarchy under shadow's swell. Minor weakness: interiority poetic but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhetorical loops thicken density toward cadence shift; closure as Earned Stasis lands on-page with "anchor steadied, possession thwarted before completion" and palette-empty cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchored immediately in dimensional anchor. No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting's fraying fissures and whispering voids constrain choices, charging final image of rewoven stillness; loop pedal and palette as micro-settings evolve tactilely through action. Sensory selection purposeful, narrowing to tendrils recoiling under pressure. Body/attention (gripped palette, stomped pedal) shapes climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart possession) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via looped rhetoric slowing tendrils—"mere breaths from completion"—forcing endurance with visible cost (palette empty). Agency in sigil-tracing narrows options. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness exposing motion's assumptions emerges via particulars like chiasmus fracturing shadow; final image "eternal silence" reconfigures premise without moral, reweighting unraveling as dispersion. Subtext in rhetorical silences invites ambiguity on chaos's presumption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in hushed, looping diction; rhythmic modulation builds under stress, as in "hyperbole swelling—looped to infinity." Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with looped crescendos matching scene propulsion; high density integrates figuration purposefully without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity") pattern-taught but slightly redundant pre-climax; no closure touch. Clean syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of loop pedal priest wielding rhetoric against shadow transforms tropes; "silence decorated his loops and sealed the shadow's maw" zeugma inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in accumulative poetics heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
