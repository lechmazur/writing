<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Steadily curious trait drives persistent actions like kaleidoscope trials, embodied in "chill biting like forgotten hunger"; irreverent awe adds contradiction via hubris chuckle at machine mutiny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as motifs of evolution and yearning densify to CR closure in silent bell toll and ascension; cost legible in "acid sea roiled below, irrelevant now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acid sea and brass workshop constrain salvage and glider lifts; kaleidoscope as micro-setting charges transliteration and turret view of fleets ascending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening machines tightens via algorithm propagation, forcing rivals' irrelevance; agency in etching cog culminates in fleet evolution under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of yearning sparking evolution emerges via arrow tip's transformation, resonant in final whisper reweighting hubris without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward glyphs and cogs; voice texture modulates rhythmically, lyric compression taught early via "froths for salvage."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition of "irreverent awe" and "evolution" motifs builds density without loops; figurative language coherent in "gears grinding with unvoiced envy," propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arrow tip birthing sentience in acid-sea world fresh synthesis; risk in machines' "nascent crave" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
