<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's skeptical interiority cracks via embodied tile warmth and memory flashes, earning her vow with contradictory impulses shown in helping the fisherman despite doubt. Micro-choices like pressing tea reveal hierarchy of values under grief pressure. Repetition of "courageously kind" borders on label-speak, slightly unearned in peak transcription beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tile deposit cues memory entanglement, tightening to transcription as resonant reconfiguration with cost in softened skepticism and shared vulnerability. Closure lands on-page in tile placement at platform's heart, reweighting isolation to shared solace. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's open walls and roiling sea constrain solitary reflection and tile exam, charging final image where tile glows amid whale crests. Sensory weave of salt air, thunder, cetacean calls filters through Elara's stargazer bias. Whale paths mirroring square symmetries evolve with events, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. sculpting reflection space) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tile-warmed memories narrowing doubt-options. Agency in frantic transcription forecloses solitary doubt with vulnerability cost, legible in sharing pages. Fisherman return tests commitment without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of entangled patterns bridging loss emerges via tile-memories harmonizing whale symphony with mother's lullabies, reweighting skepticism without statement. Final murmurs joining songs offer non-literal resonance to reflection's cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in myths lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in star-whale-pattern noticing; voice modulates lyrically under memory assault without head-hopping. Sparse dialogue ("Cursed thing") natural, subtext-laden with hollow eyes. Rhythmic prose reflects Elara's quill-scratching frenzy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense info lines like "whales' migration paths mirrored the square's symmetries" propel via image; rhythm varies with storm swells. Patterned repetition ("unheard symphony," "sculpt[ed] space") teaches motif without loop excess, but "courageously kind" paraphrase thrice dulls slightly in transcription beat. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as memory key entangled with whale migrations transforms myth tropes via quantum-correlated flashbacks. Risky lyric compression heightens pattern stakes, culminating in tile's subtle glow as inevitable solace weave. No derivative echoes; voice commits to aerie solaces.</comment>
