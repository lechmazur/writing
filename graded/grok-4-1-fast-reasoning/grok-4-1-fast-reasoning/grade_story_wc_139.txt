<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to unearth "fair trade" math is concrete and intensifies via vapor-induced shift from scruple to fluid strategy, compelling the breach choice. Contradictory impulses (honesty vs. survival) act in the inhalation beat, earning the final action. Minor telling in backstory summaries slightly dilutes embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ink pot discovery and vapor inhalation therefore enable equation-solving and precise timing for Decisive Change at "03:17:42 precisely." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure cost legible in glance back at father's body as sentinel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room's "sterile air humming," "chemical zest," and breach door adjacency constrain timing and choice, charging final "deathly vitality winking out." Sensory details filter through Eli's sharpened perception under vapor. Body-as-micro-setting (father's "eerie vigor") mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breach to asylum) tightens causally via vapor insight narrowing guard intervals to 247 seconds, forcing "vigilant calculus" trade-off. Agency in active waiting forecloses rush option with felt risk. Cost unmistakable in precise spring to breach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fair trade emerges organically from ink dissolving "rigid adherence to scruple," reweighting cons as "strategy" in etchings' equations. Final image of ink pot as talisman offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in father's "gleam approval" charges legacy handover.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: mathematical precision ("247 seconds," "03:17:42") biases noticing under vapor haze. Lyrical rhythm modulates from descriptive opening to taut action ("sprang, shoulder driving"). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with rhythm varying from long atmospheric openers to clipped climax ("No alarm wailed; math prevailed"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("living mercury," "fractal-like formulas") risks density dip but closure image clean, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms con artist trope via alchemical ink pot yielding mathematical escape in embalming room, with "fair trade" calculus as fresh synthesis. Risky "deathly vitality" tone heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Breach via probabilistic equations feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
