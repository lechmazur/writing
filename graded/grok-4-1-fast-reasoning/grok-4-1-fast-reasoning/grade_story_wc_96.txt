<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's monthly molting trait drives concrete shifts from pessimist to architect, compelling rebuild choices with embodied defiance; Mira applies relational pressure via urging seeds. Final endurance of core self amid molting earns closure cost. Minor slip: motivation "ignited, twin flames" borders label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorting sparks friendship/tin discovery, density builds to seeding/rebuilding/blooms with weeks-later CR repricing confinement as canvas. Orientation anchored early (moonlit prison library). Closure cost legible in "roots delving deep" vs. warden's rage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted eaves/cracks constrain seeding/rebar scaffolds, charging final "flowers erupted along walls" image. Sensory hierarchy (rust-mildew fog vs. stars) mirrors anarchy-to-beauty. Micro-setting (tin/beam) evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty/resist) signaled early, accumulative tightening via tin find/seeding forces trade-off (detection risk) with guards passing as complication. Cost felt in "guarded heart molting caution." Agency in micro-choices narrows to uprising poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: anarchy yields art via particular images (snakeskin molt, tin poem). Final "anarchy yielded to art" reweights premise without stating moral, resonant in garden gatherings. No tidy binary; regime blindness adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with poetic perceptual bias (fractures/stars as defiance). Dialogue subtextual ("monthly molt"), distinct voices. Rhythmic modulation under night pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High info density but overwriting: figurative density ("luminous fracture" x3, "molted"/"shed") pervades rebuild beats without pattern break, dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("rebuild/rebuild/reclaimed"). Rhythm varies but template stems in descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: molting poet + tin seeds transforms prison trope into textural resistance garden. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via "From anarchy's bloom, we rebuild the sky." No template echoes.</comment>
