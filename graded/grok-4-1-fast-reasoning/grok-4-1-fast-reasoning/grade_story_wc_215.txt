<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Recluse's motivation to preserve silence compels ritual choice with earned shift from astonishment to guardian stasis, traits shown through gaze and perception; subtle internal contradiction limits exceptionalism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density of clues to RR closure in box placement and vigil binding, cost legible in "heavier with fresh purpose" and perpetual isolation; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Oasis hives and scorched earth constrain unearthing/ritual, box as micro-setting charges final guardian image; sensory selection (hum, dew, buzz) mirrors perceptual calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of covenant renewal signaled early, escalates via clue density to ritual tightening that forecloses speech with isolation cost; agency in gaze/holding aligns with lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence-as-weight theme emerges from gestures/clues to resonant final vigil without moralizing, reweighting prior scarcity; ambiguity of ghosts' nod invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of tranquil observation, poetic diction/rhythm modulates intensity; purposeful elision of words enhances mute tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric rhythm propels with varied syntax, high density; repetitive motifs ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence") create pattern but risk paraphrase loop in late beats, dulling peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost beekeepers and glass covenant synthesize fresh redemption lattice from wasteland tropes; risk of mute ritual pays off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
