<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly from curse-chipped soul to rename, with contradictory mercy/upheaval impulses acting in the tessera dance; Kael's buried empathy flicker earns his transformation without unearned epiphany. Minor label-speak like "gentle radical heart stirred" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as vision density builds to rename ripple (RR/CR), with legible cost in "tears carving paths in soot" and Elara's loosening trap; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plaza/tessera constrain choice (tracing ignites vision, aligning chips enables rename) and charge final image (tessera solid underfoot); sensory filter (cold light like frozen blood) mirrors fractures/regret purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rename warlord's empathy) signaled early, tightens via vision deepening to ripple with agency-driven rename; cost unmistakable in Kael's rasped confession and survivors' thaw, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy emerges implicitly via rename encasing sins in steel, final image (sky flickering, arms wide) reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in retrocognitive pulses; voice texture (snow-edged softness) modulates rhythmically, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Kaelon's rasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figures like "veins of regret"; minor muddle in mixed metaphors (wept cold light like frozen blood) in opening but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive rename transforming post-fire rot via tessera glyphs; risk in aberrant mercy calculus heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
