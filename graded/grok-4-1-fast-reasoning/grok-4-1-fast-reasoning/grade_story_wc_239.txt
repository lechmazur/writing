<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel illusions intensifies compellingly through embodied cues like trembling fingers; however, interiority favors abstract cosmic summaries over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, diluting peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as inward arbitration builds density to CR closure where dictionary dissolves into unity with legible conceptual cost in the fleeting hiccup; orientation anchors early, structure spirals coherently without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library's endless shelves and spiral staircase constrain wandering path and charge final pedestal image; sensory hush and dust motes filter through Elowen's perceptual bias, evolving with cosmic knit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unify via arbitration tightens texturally as dictionary warms and library trembles, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in hiccup's convergence charges ending without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of illusory separation vs. unity emerges organically from spiraling particulars and dissolves into resonant CR image; avoids moralizing, lingering ambiguity in perpetual beginning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature biases toward cosmic veils and hush rhythms; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure, modulating with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Patterned repetitions of "hush" and "spiral" propel rhythmically but paraphrase loops in illusion descriptions and synonym churn (unify/mend/knit) dull high-pressure density near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary as cosmic scalpel in lost library transforms mysticism tropes; risk-taking in perceptual paradox heightens stakes organically to inevitable unity verdict.</comment>
