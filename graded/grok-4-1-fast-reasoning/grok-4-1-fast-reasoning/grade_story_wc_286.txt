<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zen potter's interiority embodied in scarred hands tracing murals and palms on thrumming clay; micro-choices like potting under pressure earn realization of self-mirroring phototropism. Contradictory impulses surface in seeking mercy amid desolation without alternating summaries. Final vessel lifts as earned endurance with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via lantern overlays building to thrumming density; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "understanding bloomed: resistance was no rebellion, but quiet turning" with undeniable conceptual cost of imprinted kindness over catastrophe. Orientation anchored by para 2; one meaningful deepening via sun-pattern alignment suffices. Lens holds without ambiguity to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sun patterns as sundials constrain navigation of fractures, charging pot-shaping climax; skeletal hives and thorny blooms filter through potter's tactile bias, evolving with thrumming. Sensory hierarchy narrows to thrums in bones during peak. Recurring smoke and shadows mirror internal turn without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel resistance signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lantern glimpses to thrumming convergence forcing stance crystallization in pot's emergence. Agency in tracing patterns forecloses doubt-path with felt alignment cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kindness-bent endurance emerges organically from beekeeper legacies and Kai's mirroring arc, reweighted in final vessel as "map of endurance" without moralizing. Subtext in phantom bees and fractured light invites ambiguity of eternal mercy vs. void. Resonant non-literal answer crystallizes phototropism over force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "breath on cracked earth" and thrumming syntax modulating to peak compression; rhythmic diction reflects zen mind under pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture purposeful in lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "chimney smoke fully flattened, pooling like ink on dusk" advancing image and thrumming motif; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds despite thrumming recurrence (pattern-taught payoff). Minor overwriting in metaphors consistent and legible at closure; zero artifacts dull peak pot-lift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractured timelines and phototropic kindness transforms wasteland tropes via potter's sun-pattern pottery; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR without gimmickry. Non-obvious beekeeper compassion lattice as resistance core feels organic and hindsight-earned.</comment>
