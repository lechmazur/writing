<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's eccentricity shines through concrete actions like whispering to the sea and probing gaps, earning the pinning choice with embodied isolation; prior loss mirrors stranger's without unearned epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in reflective beats keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density and gap-probing tightening to CR closure: pinning reconfigures borrowed to owned memories with conceptual cost of endured isolation legible in "memories intertwined, no longer borrowed but owned." Orientation anchored early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain retrieval and investigation, charging final image where dock "gleamed faintly, holding secrets"; nautical twilight filters sensory hierarchy through Elias's eccentric perception, mirroring internal voids without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture deepens accumulatively via gaps revealing shared loss, narrowing to endurance with cost in self-mirroring; agency in pinning forecloses borrowed isolation, but quiet pressure lacks one sharper trade-off for 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of isolation as echo-space emerges organically from flower-touch particulars and gap method, resonant non-literal answer in lighthouse beam guiding "phantoms home" reweighting voids as bonds; ambiguity lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature—mutters to gulls, dock veins like flower heart—modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, no elision issues, though poetic elevation risks minor register drift in peak realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density ("frozen whispers," "twilight's bruise-purple") overwrites high-reflection beats without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly; motif repetition purposeful, but paraphrase echoes like repeated "softly persistent" trigger -0.4 loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-transfer flower, gap-decoding, and self-echo suicide transforms lighthouse trope via eccentric POV; risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable pinning in hindsight.</comment>
