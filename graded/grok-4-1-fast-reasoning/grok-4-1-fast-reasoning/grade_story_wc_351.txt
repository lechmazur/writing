<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong helix-minded particularity in micro-adjustments and embodied trembling drives earned change to dream-digger; minor diagnostic slips like "synaptic plasticity deepened" feel label-like without full contradiction in peak visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density surge from flicker to entangled cascade, landing Charged Poise RR in "Transformation complete" with conceptual cost of fused periscope-identity; orientation anchored early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlight pooling in crevice and silt-parting glyphs constrain mirror-use and charge final helix-monument image; sensory hierarchy (visual fractals mirroring neural chaos) vivid and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant reinvention stake tightens via cascading visions narrowing isolation to legend; agency in gaze/intention forecloses engineer-path with felt fusion-cost, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entanglement theme emerges organically from helixed visions reviving dreams, resonant CR in canyon-sigh disentangling isolation; no moralizing, ambiguity in "forever linked" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct helix-perceptual signature ("double-spiraled lattices") and rhythmic modulation under reverie stress consistent; single POV stable, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "chaotically precise"/"helix" repetitions and figurative density overload ("neural pulses that infiltrated her cortex") dull high-pressure cascade; propulsion strong but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh neural-archaeology synthesis via quantum-tangled dreams in sci-fi canyon feels inevitable; risk-taking in synaptic-modification heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
