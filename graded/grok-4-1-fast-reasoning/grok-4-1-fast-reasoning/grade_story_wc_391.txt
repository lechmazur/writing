<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—wild heart pounding against restrained mapping ritual—and final unyoking choice is earned by prior botched scout and Kai's anchoring. Interiority concrete via itching fingers and breath clouds; flaws complicate without hedging. Past reflection anchors present micro-choices like donning furs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: freeze therefore cross, moon alignment therefore fields waver, severing sparks DC with legible cost in viaduct shudder and freed souls. Orientation anchors early (lake, sanctuary, viaduct). Single-shard scope fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain choices—ice enables crossing, cliffs foster restraint—charging final image of thawing revolution roots. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: mapper traces viaduct silhouette amid wind howls. Rain-slick girders spark under hands, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient unyoking) tightens via moon nadir, forcing trade-off of wild charge for precise sever; agency in scaling/prying forecloses reckless path with embodied cost (wind-clawed climb). Escalation causal: past lives lost narrows to this timed act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from mapping restraint to cable sever, final image ("roots now delved deep") reweighting impatience with non-literal resonance. Subtext in Kai's nod and basalt cracks avoids moralizing; ambiguity in slow awakening lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: flint eyes trace arcs, diction/rhythm ("softly purposeful steps") modulates pressure without filter excess. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven (Kai's grip/praise). No head-hopping; elision of lowlands taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-job (advance action/embody emotion); rhythm varies with stress (short climb sentences). Minor motif repetition ("restrained wildness") pattern-taught, not looping; no artifacts dulling sparks shower climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: moon-path mapping times magnetic unyoking in basalt sci-fi frame transforms revolution trope via personal impatience arc. Risk in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
