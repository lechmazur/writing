<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blindness flaw enables fractal precision in crafting, turning limitation into strength with embodied micro-choices like hands layering mirrors; final transcendence earned via prior causality in portrait background and coin deciphering. Contradictory impulses (blindness as cage then freedom) act in scene without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery-coin-deciphering-crafting builds density to CR closure in sky-mirror amid tremor, with legible cost in tree's fall and her lingered gaze; orientation anchored early (Elara in tree library at dawn), single scene + shard fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bark channels, scavenged mirrors constrain carving choices with precision cost; final inner sky charges image, sensory hierarchy (touch/grooves, light refraction) filtered through artist's pattern bias evolves with tremor dust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (mirror sky before erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via coin method and foreman "Positions," forcing endurance agency; cost unmistakable in tremor vibration and foreclosed guild failure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of limits transcended emerges organically from guild failure vs. her pattern-sight success, resonant CR in enduring sky reweighting blindness as unbound vision without moralizing; final salvaged planks reprise shifts motif meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in fractal noticing and stillness diction; rhythmic control heightens pressure (breath syncing tree pulse) without filter excess, prose texture particular to artist mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring fractal recursion; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative layering (light bending like constellations) coherent in peak craft beat without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree-library + face-blind fractal crafting premise synthesizes fresh angle on limits/transcendence, risk-taking in prose texture heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable particulars like coin grooves make turns inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
