<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's gift to hear unspoken words roots his motivation deeply and enables seeding doubts, shown concretely in students' smiles and guards' pauses; internal drive intensifies without overt contradiction, earning the subtle change. Lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure, leaning poetic over visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of seeding, grotto sync, display activation builds to CR closure where displays form gambit and seeds root with conceptual cost of subtlety vs. conformity. Orientation anchors early; shards cohere without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's lodestone veins and glass dome constrain rook activation and charge starlit final image; mist, sapphire tomes filter through Elias's perceptual bias, evolving tactilely. Sensory hierarchy sharpens hush urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subtle rebellion signaled early escalates accumulatively via sync replicas to hush activation, narrowing to quiet gambit with felt cost in risked detection. Agency in orchestration tightens once coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet defiance emerges organically from chess motifs shifting to forests of doubt, resonant CR ending reweights conformity without moralizing—"seeds had taken—forests destined to overshadow dogma."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (mist/quiet/chess filters) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation builds texture; purposeful compression teaches poetic pattern paid in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density but figurative overload in climax ("loaves marched forward, pins knighted") dulls propulsion slightly; minor loops in "mist"/"quiet" motifs, yet varied rhythm and info density propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic chess sync via windows transforms rebellion trope into fresh, inevitable gambit; bold poetic synthesis risks lyric density but heightens stakes organically.</comment>
