<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-consistent (withdrawn yet driven to orchard), compelling pledge and unsnap; embodied thrill in "chilled his spine with ecstatic thrill," but limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously weaken peak choice depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to unsnap cascade (DC/RR closure) with soul-pledge cost legible in "binding his soul to the marionettes' spectral troupe"; one tightening at clasp chime suffices, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains via root pedestal alignment and glowing veins syncing patterns; vivid sensory (dew-slick, humming sap, warping walls) filtered through knight's mystical notice; charges final crystal orbs, but minor visual overreliance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shifts thickening air to peak threads coiling wrist; agency in pledge/unsnap forecloses withdrawn path with allegiance cost, one deepening at unleash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of solitude-to-mastery emerges organically from pledge, threads, and "silence became legend's voice"; resonant CR in talisman image reweights prior patterns without moralizing, though ambition lingers slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to arcane weaves; distinct poetic texture ("molten glass," rhythmic whispers) modulates intensity, whisper natural; capped by Q7 line debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("shivering bliss" x3, "factually mystical" x3, "reality shifts" x3) and paraphrase churn (e.g., fruits quiver/juices etch post-pledge) dull propulsion in peak unsnap beat; dense overwriting with mixed metaphors (molten glass/prismatic shards) obscures slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly withdrawal with marionette-alchemy for possibility-threads transforms tropes organically; risk in "factually mystical" verification heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
