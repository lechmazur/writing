<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in past mistake compels micro-choices like trembling hand and palm-seal, with embodied conflict in spectral vision; delegates apply generic pressure without distinction. Internal contradiction acts in gentle resolve versus haunting guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to signing to seal, with on-page Charged Poise closure (spectral vision + ache forecloses personal peace) and legible cost in "quiet ache of what was forever lost"; orientation anchored early, no test fail.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ancient terrace constrains ritual choices (altar, braziers bind oaths), celestial dance charges final image mirroring union; sensory details (moss-veined marble, torchlight) filtered through Elara's priorities, evolve with flames/tremble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via peace) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via delegate signings narrowing enmity; agency in mustering/palm-press forecloses war path with her vision-cost, legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Price of redemption emerges via ritual events/particulars (blood ink, spectral boy), final image reconfigures flawed beauty with lingering embers ambiguity; no moralizing, resonant non-literal answer in mended fractures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in poetic celestial/body filters; voice modulates rhythmically (gentle tide to trembling hand), purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density (celestial dance, flawed beauty) borders overwriting in signing beat without muddle but risks propulsion; minor paraphrase loops ("operatively gentle" reprise purposeful yet templated); rhythm varies, density strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ritual peace amid celestial waltz transforms negotiator trope via redemption price and sigil mechanics; fresh synthesis in starfire oaths and personal haunting feels inevitable, risks bold lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
