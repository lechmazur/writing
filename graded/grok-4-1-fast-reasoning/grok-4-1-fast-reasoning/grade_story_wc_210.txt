<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation intensely clear and consistent—rejection of ghosts' illusions with "wave of his hand" reveals unquenched fire driving higher-stakes mental forging; embodied strain ("sweat beaded his brow") grounds endurance without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction in refusing "hollow peace" while juggling exhaustive details earns final integration. Minor abstraction in "uncorked his mind" slightly dilutes character-particular interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early (mental juggling of essences) holds to Charged Poise closure: bottle cools as revival solidifies, reconfiguring isolation with legible strain cost ("working memory strained"). Single scene anchored instantly ("Paper-Lantern Cove"); one tightening via visions solidifying forecloses surrender. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration—lanterns' "pale glow" and waves "lapping at pylons" mirror isolation then transmutation, constraining conception on weathered pier. POV bias shapes notice (alchemical salts from springs). Recurring lanterns charge final image, evolving causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine civilization) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory overload forcing rejection of distractions; agency in "conceive" narrows to endurance with sweat/stain cost visible in peak. Coherent pressure reweights false comfort vs authentic striving. No abstract stakes or coincidences resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of authentic striving vs illusion emerges organically from rejection wave and revival particulars, culminating in non-literal final image ("lanterns dancing... legacy reimagined") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in ghostly whispers tensions concept; ambiguity lingers in "whatever civilization dreamed next."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "forge of the present mind"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in strain beats. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, eliding mechanics without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor overwrite in peak ("juggling vivid recollections... layering them atop blueprints") risks figurative muddle; varied rhythm passes ear test. No loops or scaffolds dull closure; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Repetitive "working memory" stems purposeful, not templated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mental alchemy reviving ghost town via seamless bottle and memory forge transforms tropes (abandoned alchemist) organically. Risky accumulative conception heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight; no derivative templates, bold premise commitment.</comment>
