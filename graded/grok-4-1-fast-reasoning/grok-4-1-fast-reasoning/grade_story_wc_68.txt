<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior conflict embodied in cog-grooves mirroring certainty fractures compels delve choice with felt doubt-cost; "rationally rebellious" diagnostic label slightly abstracts peak fusion resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via strata density tightening causal evidence to cog-fusion RR/Charged Poise; legible cost in "abrasive calm exposure" foreclosing isolation, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sedimentary strata constrain auger-probe choices and mirror internal grudges; bioluminescent fungi and silt cake charge final cog-pulse image without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake deepens accumulatively per stratum reversal, agency in methodical sifting narrows narrative options; frantic excavation cost alters fusion tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically via cult-rebuff and log defiance, final "Rebellion rationalizes truth" etch reweights premise non-literally; ambiguity lingers in endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Close-third perceptual signature (slime-slick manifestos, silt-caked beard) biases details philosopherically; rhythmic syntax modulates agony peaks steadily, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Agonize" loops (x4) and dense metaphors ("drowned fire," "grudges") in stratum beats create minor churn dulling excavation propulsion; density still advances tightly to whir.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sky-galleon cogs in post-plague sewers synthesize fresh rational-rebellion frame; strata-delving transforms trope ruins into evidence crucible without hedging.</comment>
