<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's reckless idealism drives ritual choices with consistent traits like fiercely gentle precision, embodied in blood slice and rune-tracing; internal voids from brother's death motivate patching via bartered fates. Minor label-telling ("reckless idealist") early slightly abstracts, but closure change feels earned without unmotivated epiphany. Contradictory resolve (mend soul yet risk freedom) acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via ritual steps (card press, chant, blood) to RR closure in "trammel bound tighter" and departing bridge between worlds, with felt cost of unpaid prices legible in shadows whispering and pulsing root. Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words in catacomb orchard. No causality breaks; persistent root/bone constraints shape tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective—roots cradling skull, phosphorescent fungi—constrains ritual (bones for shard, roots for binding) and charges closure glow as "testament to resolve born in bone and root." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward meaning-making; spatial choreography coherent in loam-strewn corridor. No white-room; evolves causally with quivering roots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-patching via destiny barter) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through visions flooding and binding pull, narrowing freedom with on-page cost in "shadows deepened, whispering of prices yet unpaid." Agency in methodical ritual forecloses broken path; moral calculus in gentle sacrifice vs. ensnarement. Escalation coherent under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inlaid meaning amid loss emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted in final image of pulsing root/laughter echo answering barter's jagged cost without moralizing. Subtext in card's gold inlay mirroring soul-patching; ambiguity lingers in potential ensnarement. No tidy binaries; protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of idealist weaving fate (e.g., "turning ordinary remnants into talismans"); rhythmic prose modulates from dusky description to thickened air under ritual stress. No head-hopping or withholding; diction character-bound, poetic texture purposeful and consistent. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots groaned, coiling to trammel the card" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, read-aloud propulsive. Minor overwriting in root-snaking recurrences purposeful for accumulative texture, but occasional paraphrase loops ("fiercely gentle" thrice) slightly dull mid-ritual without obscuring closure image. No filter stacks or template cadence; metaphors coherent (veins through marble).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb ritual bartering fates transforms tarot/trope into gold-inlaid nexus; voice's poetic specificity (dusky orchard glow) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, bold commitment to premise implications like tighter bind.</comment>
