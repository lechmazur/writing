<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to trick Fear rooted in post-resuscitation limbo and crystallizes early; contradictory impulses in glow's repulsive allure shown through embodied hesitation and embrace. Final hurling of clasp earned by prior unbosomings with felt cost of lingering scar. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "core shame" slightly dilutes interiority peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: advisor whisper therefore seeks dictionary, recitations therefore draw Fear, clasp hurl therefore DC dissolution with legible cost in "seductive scar drawing her to new shadows." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherence to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain by manifesting Fear and infinite reflections, booth supplies pivotal dictionary; recurring glass weeps at climax, charging final image. Sensory moldy cotton candy/rust selective and POV-filtered through glow urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trick Fear signaled early, escalates causally via each unbosoming narrowing distance/options, agency peaks in clasp bait forcing revelation. One tightening sufficient; cost in unresolved allure forecloses pure escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of unbosoming paradoxes conquering Fear emerges via dictionary notes and advisor twist, resonant CR in pocketed "Victory curses the victor" reweighting survival. Avoids morals through lingering ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with gothic perceptual signature (iridescent veins, wet velvet whispers); voice modulates rhythm to pressure, advisor quotes subtextual. Minor repetition convergence in advisor/Elara diction under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Overwriting density: figurative stacks like "maw a vortex of teeth grinning with grotesque charm" in Fear lunges obscure propulsion (-0.7); ending paraphrase loops ("lingering luminance pulsed once more, promising further unbosomings" restates prior dissolution). Template cadence in recitation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: photographic curse + luminance ritual transforms funhouse trope, advisor-as-Fear twist inevitable from whispers; risk in paradoxical mechanics heightens stakes organically.</comment>
