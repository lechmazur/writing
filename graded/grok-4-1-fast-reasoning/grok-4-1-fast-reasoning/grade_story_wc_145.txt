<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dry wit and subtle confidence drive micro-choices like quipping to the falcon and overlaying the atlas, earning the departure with embodied thrill masked by humor. Interiority concrete via pulse quickening and chuckling at "water conspires," revealing cartographic obsession without labels. Minor flaw: motivation's depth leans slightly told in "true motivation burned deeper" before dramatized proofs accumulate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: falcon's vellum, phrasebook translation, and condensation pattern build density to Charged Poise closure in "singular convergence crystallized—not just rivers, but fates," with nagging tranquility as felt cost in final lines. Orientation anchored early in outpost/lake. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; persistent constraint of mythic source shapes tactics to departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and rusted outpost constrain choices (skirt cracks, ascend glacier) and charge final image (lake as "silver scar," tranquility as "serene predator"). Sensory hierarchy via Harlan's priorities: iced feathers, steam rivulets mirror convergence motif purposefully. Body/tool as micro-setting: breath on glass etches map, pivotal in "pattern matched precisely."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' genesis via convergence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through proofs narrowing to trek despite guardian worry; agency in interpreting signs forecloses hesitation with isolation cost felt in "white unknown." Escalation via density reweights under lens, but tranquility nag lacks one deeper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of obsessive convergence emerges organically from accumulating signs to final "fates: editor, bird, book, and breath... aligning," reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in wit masking dread charges "subtle fracture in the ice of certainty." Resonant ambiguity lingers in guardian hint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: cartographic bias in "silence had a map," "aqueous omen." Voice texture via dry quips like "Old bird, you've outdone the Ordnance Survey" modulates rhythm under thrill. No head-hopping; diction fits wry explorer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/image (e.g., "falcon's vellum pinpointed... aqueous omen sealed it"). Rhythm varies for ear; minor overwrite in repeated tranquility but purposeful under tone. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: falcon-vellum, steam-map convergence transforms explorer trope into cartographic obsession with omens. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in "map redraws us" final line, inevitable hindsight. No derivatives; bold voice commits to mythic plateaus.</comment>
