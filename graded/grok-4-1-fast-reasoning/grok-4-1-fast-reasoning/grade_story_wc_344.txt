<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via gear clinks evoking father's fingers; contradictory reverence/trembling in final alignment earns change with felt nostalgia cost. Micro-choices like selecting pieces reveal values hierarchy. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophecy scraps to gear alignment cascades to clockwork heart reveal; closure as RR (rhythm learned) lands on-page with visions' emotional cost ("patient weave of loss and longing"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirrors and pedestal constrain choices (grooves fit gears) and charge final image (reflections converge on wholeness); sensory hierarchy (ozone, rime, whirs) POV-filtered via locksmith lens. Micro-setting (crystal cap) evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn rhythm) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via prophecies/gears to sync pulse; agency in meshing pinion forecloses unlearned state with sweat/visions cost legible at uncapping. Escalation coherent under lens, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Repair-as-resurrection emerges via gear memories shifting to "extensions of his will"; final image ("rhythm pulsing eternally") non-literal answer reweighting loss without moralizing. Nostalgia motif charges closure organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical texture distinct (e.g., "breath crystallizing... whisper of driftwood nostalgia"); perceptual signature locksmith-specific (gears as "tiny brass worlds"); stable close-third, compression purposeful and pattern-taught to closure glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peak ("prismatic ghosts of memory") coherent without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion syncs scene (clinks urging onward).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith repairs self via library mechanism transforms trope into inevitability; risk in lyric infinity/mirrors heightens stakes, closure reconfigures nostalgia boldly without gimmick.</comment>
