<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory skepticism clashes with compelled confession via radio, earning valve-turn release; embodied pulse and drowsiness sharpen predatory focus without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as radio calls densify patterns to confession hush (CR closure), with legible cost in "weight lifted... feather-light revelation"; orientation anchored early, single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel silt, drips, and beaded valve constrain kneeling/tracing/turning choices and charge final dust phantoms; sensory hierarchy narrows under drowsy urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth) tightens via call interpretations narrowing denial options; agency in appraisal forces trade-off with felt remorse cost at valve strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost shift reweights to psychic residue via beads/radio, resonant CR in "human echoes demanding reckoning" without moralizing; particulars like Father Reilly's rosaries emerge organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct drowsy perceptual signature ("heavy-lidded yet scanning... predatory sharpness") biases noticing; stable third-limited POV, rhythmic modulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action ("boots crunching gravel"); minor paraphrase loop in "drowsy alertness" x3 deducts, but purposeful motif rhythm varies overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Radio as subconscious confessional transforms ghost trope ingeniously, inevitable from valve touch; risk in solo psychic jury pays off in release image.</comment>
