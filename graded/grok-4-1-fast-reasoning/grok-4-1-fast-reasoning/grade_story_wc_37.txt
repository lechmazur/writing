<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rekindle via songs roots clearly in her scattered memories, with embodied pain ("lanced Elara's temples") driving endurance. Contradictory impulses peak as pain scatters fragments further yet compels the third song. Minor slip: specters feel archetypal without distinct pressure on her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo humming to choral amplification, tightening via shadow resistance into RR closure ("Endless night peeled back... first woven dawn"). Orientation anchors immediately in greenhouse. Cost legible in tree's convulsion and memory realignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective: Heart Tree's "veins throbbing faintly" and mica window constrain weaving, charging final clear view. Sensory hierarchy fits Elara's bias toward light motes. Mica window reprise recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via successive songs gathering communities against night tendrils. Tightening at third song forces agency despite pain, foreclosing isolation. Cost felt in resistance and temple pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of communal binding/release emerges organically from spectral knitting and dawn-weave, resonating in "communities forever intertwined." Final image ("mica window framed a horizon ablaze") non-literally answers fracture via harmony, with lingering whispers adding ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, with perceptual signature in "mosaic... fireflies in fog" modulating rhythmically under stress. Compression purposeful and taught early, enhancing accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in weaving beats; metaphors consistent in fantasy idiom without muddle. Minor artifacts: ending paraphrase loops ("Elara rose... Elara hummed... realm endured") slightly dull closure propulsion, but not obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-weaving and spectral song transforms mirror-world tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. "Woven dawns" premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight via songs' causal texture.</comment>
