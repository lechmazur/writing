<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's affectionate skepticism drives contradictory impulses, shown in probing hugs masking racing heart and devising tests despite gut twists; final embrace earns certainty with embodied cost. Minor diagnostic slips like "somatic marker" and Damasio reference slightly abstract emotions mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fractal light exposures build density to blind-test tightening, landing Charged Poise closure in willow exposures revealing shared memory with felt doubt-cost. Orientation anchored early in studio; lens clear by midpoint. Minor end summary slightly dulls image precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sliver as micro-setting constrains choices (prism centerpiece) and charges final image as "testament," with ozone, prickles, spectral cascades selectively mirroring internal fractals. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; spatial choreography clear through rig dances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test telepathy reality) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via exposure rounds to blind-test agency narrowing doubt options; cost legible in throat-close sync and hidden-thrill shudder. Pressure coheres to stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-to-natural telepathy emerges organically from somatic tests and fractal images, with willowglass motif reweighting to unbreakable hope in final embrace without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in sliver's depths; minor overt "willowglass hope solidifying" edges toward echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (skeptical fractals, affectionate warmth); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual ("Help me devise this"). Elevated phrasing consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but dense figurative layering ("frozen lightning," repeated fractals) borders overwriting in peak exposures without full payoff. Minor paraphrase loops in affection/somatic phrasing; no closure-dulling artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting fractals testing somatic telepathy post-pill recall transforms pseudoscience tropes into organic arc; blind-test turn inevitable from setup, risk-taking in experimental method heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
