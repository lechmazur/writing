<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied curiosity drives micro-choices like unclasping the case despite chill; revelation at ninth floor earns identity shift with cost of reframed past, though initial "warmly inquisitive" label slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with floor-by-floor density building to CR closure ("joy beneath anguish was hers now"); cost legible in identity reconfiguration as doors part; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice-veined glass and prismatic light diffract via goggles to enable revelations, constraining reading to elevator's climb and charging final step-out; selective sensory details mirror emotional layers without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing secrets escalates via accumulative deepening per floor, culminating in knowledge shift that forecloses servant identity with felt heritage cost; agency in persistent reading narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from diary layers to resonant CR final image; no moralizing, ambiguity in "affectionate detachment" invites rereading prior service.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters light/emotions inquisitively; rhythmic prose modulates from humming ascent to blazing convergence, voice coherent and lyrical without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "rainbows cascading across the pages"; varied rhythm propels floors, but minor scaffold intrusions ("[599—error...]") dull near-closure momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of goggles' fractal diffraction unlocking diary in timed elevator beats transforms inheritance trope; risk of floor-patterned structure heightens inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
