<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely as "clawed at his chest" and triggers contradictory play despite fear; prudent mapping and modulation earn final thrust. Minor slip in "flash of insight" borders unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: organ play therefore mutiny therefore compass thrust as DC closure; cost legible in "lingering claustrophobic echo in his veins" with before/after legible. Orientation anchored early in descent under starlight; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus constrains choices via narrowing "throat of stone" and mutiny; starlight fractures into shards charging climax image. Organ pipes as micro-setting enable reverberation tactic; sensory hierarchy claustrophobic and goal-directed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key) signaled early tightens causally via organ-triggered mutiny narrowing survival options; agency in defiant play and thrust forecloses crush path with phobia cost. Escalation coherent under causal lens to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion vs voids emerges organically from phobia play and conquest; final "adventurer reborn" reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonance from organ memories mirroring spatial defiance, lingering echo adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with claustrophobic perceptual bias (shadows "conspired to squeeze"); lyrical rhythm modulates tension but elevated diction drifts slightly in climax. No dialogue; voice distinct yet risks committee polish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops in final third ("wistful no more, yet ever rebellious"; "mutiny quelled/forge/mastery") dull closure image with synonym churn on rebellion/prudent; template cadence in descriptive runs. Figurative density overwrites peak ("predatory jaws", "stake through beast's heart") without payoff, obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny via organ reconfigures explorer trope through phobia crucible; compass-organ-key synthesis feels inevitable from blueprint etchings. Bold risk in metaphysical physics pays off without gimmick.</comment>
