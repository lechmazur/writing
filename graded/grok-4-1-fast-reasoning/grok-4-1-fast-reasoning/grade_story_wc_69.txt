<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to braid voices feels rooted and intensifies accumulatively, compelling her teaching choices. Choir members transform credibly from archetypes via voices, but lack embodied contradiction or distinct internality beyond roles. Final endurance of vanishing arts earned with mild cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: clashing voices build density to harmonious reconfiguration. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost in "vanishing arts might fade, but this braid endured." Orientation anchored early; time summary fits lens without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn sensory details selective, purposeful; rosette as micro-setting constrains teaching and charges final trace. Atmosphere tensions resignation with harmony, mirroring internal braid. Spatial choreography clear despite group.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlearning hatred signaled early; accumulative escalation via softening voices, Joren's falter as tightening forecloses discord path. Agency in Elara's method; cost felt in time/residue cracking. No live options narrowed sharply at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges organically from zither demos and choir progress; rosette motif reweights at "quiet talisman." Resonant final image answers without moralizing, embracing complexity of fractured souls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Elara with perceptual signature in musical filters; voice lyrical, modulates to whisper at peak. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Listen... harmony isn't addition"). Some register elevation fits traveled idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy repetition ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "denote") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across descriptions, dulling propulsion. Figurative density overwrought in opening, mixed vehicles (sigils/storms/mandala). Closure image legible despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zither rosette as notation-map transforms choir redemption trope into fresh excision method. Lyrical accumulative arc risks poetic compression, heightening stakes via vanishing arts endurance. Organic synthesis feels inevitable in final braid.</comment>
