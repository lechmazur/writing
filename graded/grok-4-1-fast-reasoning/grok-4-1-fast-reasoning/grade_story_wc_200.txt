<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to integrate laughter into healing drives consistent micro-choices, culminating in the climactic melody shift that earns Harlan's release. Interiority feels embodied through pendant's heat and harp's groan, revealing resolve under chill and sweat. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak pursuit keeps it from 9-band; resolute trait dominates without deep internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes, confessions, and distorted notes builds to resonant reconfiguration when laughter cracks Harlan's ache, with legible cost in Elara's lingering chest pain and endless pursuit. Single scene anchors orientation early ("Echo Gorge... hidden sunrise"). Closure Charged Poise lands cleanly on tooth flaring and absorbing soul, reweighting prior spectral pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorge's mist, sheer walls, and echoing chorus constrain pursuit, amplifying confessions to force harp tactic evolution; crocodile tooth and harp as micro-settings guide and charge climax. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to immediacies under stress (scorching pendant, slick rocks). Final sun crest recharges dawn hush, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture evading jester soul) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density—confessions intensify, shadows coalesce, fingers dance faster—forcing laughter integration as tightening under lens. Protagonist agency in playing parody notes forecloses solemn path with effort cost (sweat, climb). Climax cost unmistakable in soul's torrent yielding to genuine chuckle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of laughter-thawing sorrow emerges organically from harp mirroring discord to parody, reweighting confessions in Harlan's ghostly chuckle amid dirge. Final image of gold-chased shadows offers non-literal answer, lingering ache complicating tidy restoration. No moralizing; ambiguity in Elara's bittersweet burden invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in luminous ache diction and rhythmic swells matches Elara's soul-weaving lens; syntax modulates from hushed description to jagged peaks ("high and jagged, like giggles choked by thorns"). Stable third-limited POV with no leakage; single call to Harlan carries subtext of lure. Prose texture heightens pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Plucking... warped chord erupted" advances plot, atmosphere, stakes). Minor overwrite in metaphor density during climb ("invisible pies, banana peels") borders muddle but coheres lyrically; no loops, though "pursued/pursuing" echoes purposefully. Rhythm varies for ear, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jester's tragic mirth healed via misaligned harp in echoing gorge transforms soul-collector trope through laughter's weaponized edge. Risky lyric compression pays off in inevitable-feeling climax where "The king slipped first!" inverts betrayal. No derivative echoes; particulars like tooth-harvested pendant anchor bold vision.</comment>
