<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's precognitive curse embodies contradictory torment—visions splinter joy into dread—pushing micro-choices like persisting through failure flashes during rock placements, earning the climactic shift to blessing with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as rock placements densify power and visions to a conceptual repricing closure: "He understood: the Slip was no accident," reconfiguring curse and promise with transmutation cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frictionless tidal bluff constrains gathering dust and rock placements, with aurora/eels mirroring sequences to charge final mandala glow; micro-setting of basalt rocks and star-dust slurry shapes pivotal math alignments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harness patterns escalates accumulatively via each rock's deepening hum and vision assaults, narrowing options to final cascade that crystallizes stance; agency in placements bears felt cost of doubt-torment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-unity emerges organically from eels/aurora mirroring sequences, resolving in non-literal CR: "the world, frictionless, slid toward infinity," reweighting Slip as fulfillment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of flows and spirals ("glided like living smoke") modulates rhythmically under vision stress, teaching poetic compression early for legible lyric closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor patterned repetition in ending litany ("Promise lingered... Harnessed forever") risks paraphrase feel despite intentional sacred echo, slightly dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh frictionless world synthesizes eels, precog curse, and math-harnessed star dust into inevitable CR; bold lyric risk of ending litany heightens pattern stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
