<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve small moments drives meticulous ritual choices, embodied in trembling fingers and tears sharpening focus during the steep. Interior contradiction surfaces in haunted euphoria's joy-chill mix, earning the renewal without epiphanies. Final covenant regeneration feels compelled by her archival traits, with spectral touch as visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual layers build density to moon-crest culmination as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting loss into charged poise with his fade as felt cost ("he faded willingly into the locket"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara on jetty at twilight). Single scene causality intact via petal sequence to ink vapor-shapes; minor flatness in inevitable progression caps below 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains ritual (petals selected for resonances, seawater for bowl), charges closure (glow bathes her, blooms dim sated). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: pollen as "stardust regrets," sea lapping approval mirrors internal states. Micro-setting (bone spoon from rib) integrates tactilely, evolving with events (intensified glow at steep).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density: murmurs in bubbles force stirring endurance, moon crest tightens to ink incarnate. Agency in layering petals narrows options; cost legible in tears blurring photo and his willing fade foreclosing permanence. One decisive deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of small moments' weight emerges organically from proximate petal choices to inscribed promise, final image ("locket warm against her chest") resonating non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in ritual's deliberate threads vs. oblivion's tide invites ambiguity on haunting's price. Protagonist arc inextricable: devotion confronts loss cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in archival texture ("vials of deep brown ink distilled from crushed walnuts and ancient memory-residue"), perceptual bias on minutiae consistent. Stable single POV, no leakage; psychic distance modulates with intensity (whisper to spectral dialogue natural/subtextual). Rhythm purposeful under stress, eliding for lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion via integrated sensory action; high density does multiple jobs (e.g., "petals dissolving into tendrils... coiled around the locket"). Overwriting in figurative density during steep ("vines," "euphoric waves") borders muddle but pattern-taught; minor loops ("haunted euphoria" x3, "gently thorough" x2) dull peak slightly (-0.4). No scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: walnut-ink ritual on memory-jetty transforms preservation trope via proximate causes and ink-wars backstory, inevitable in hindsight. Risk in spectral regeneration heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, voice commits to lyric fantasy logic.</comment>
