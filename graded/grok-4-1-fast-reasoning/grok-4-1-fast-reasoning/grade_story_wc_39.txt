<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as translator compels micro-choices like sweetening the music box, with embodied doubt ("doubt lingered like dune fog") creating contradictory impulses acted out in his venture out; final endurance of solitude earns redemption with felt cost in the grandmother's tears validating his purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from dawn capture to noon validation and dusk return, with clear two-shard structure (loft-huts-loft); closure as Charged Poise lands in "heart sweetened beyond measure," reconfiguring doubt with legible emotional cost in the lingering "lonesome splendor."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (curlew cries, marram sigh, jar vapors) filters through Elias's sound-obsessed POV, constraining choices via loft shelves and dune isolation; recurring jars charge final image of "poetry etched not in ink, but in sound."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose vs. solitude doubt signaled early tightens via music box discovery and sweetening, culminating in grandmother's reaction forcing stance crystallization; agency in selling jars forecloses isolation path with on-page relational cost felt in her whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bridging eras emerges from jar alchemy and elder's tears, reweighting redemption without statement; final image of winding the box offers resonant answer to doubt, charging prior particulars with non-literal generational echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-perceptual signature ("melody frail as spider silk") stable in close third; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've brought him back"), modulating rhythm under pressure without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("vapors twist like auroras") propels accumulatively, no loops/artifacts; figurative language consistent and voice-motivated, clarity peaks in closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jar alchemy transforms vagrant trope into purpose-driven art; risky lyric compression heightens stakes, with music box reprise feeling inevitable and closure reweighting premise organically.</comment>
