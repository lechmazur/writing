<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theo's compulsion and lack of fear amid ghosts drive steady micro-choices like engaging the specter; embodied chill and fractional burden lift earn the arc without deep contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust patterns and barrel cue grate reveal; on-page DC (bones lowered, ghosts dissolve) lands with legible cost in lifted burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust eddies and rusted grate constrain path to climax while mirroring internal façades; sensory mildew/popcorn selectivity charges circus decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to unveil ceilings tightens via buzz death and ghost emergence forcing barrel pry; agency narrows options to release with burden cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Façade cracks motif reweights via mainspring and ghost release; final pocketed barrel offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of hidden truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with tech's perceptual bias for mechanisms yields textured rhythm; Theo's direct question to ghost carries natural goal-subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density weaves action into "dust spirals" propulsion; minor figurative density in opening ghosts-as-smoke avoids muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing tech decoding circus clock-secrets synthesizes fresh via dust/mechanics; risk in spectral causality heightens inevitability.</comment>
