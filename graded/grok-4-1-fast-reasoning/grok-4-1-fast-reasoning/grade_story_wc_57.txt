<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve shines through patient micro-choices like using fulgurite gently, with embodied patience in cold snow; Kael adds crucible pressure via wariness turning to awe. Internal conflict subtle but consistent in coaxing vs. haste. Minor flaw: philosophizing ("preservation demanded communion") borders on unearned epiphany, not fully dramatized in peak decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot revelations build density, culminating in master weave's Charged Poise closure where Elias pockets fulgurite, richer with wisdom, pact sealing fragile endurance cost. Orientation anchored early in dock/harbor/snow. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased: fog's hush/beads, dock's creak/glow constrain encounter and veil revelations, charging final image of sentinel on sighing dock. Weather (snow/fog) evolves causally, mirroring unveiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via layered knot decodings narrowing to genesis mandala; agency in coaxing yields pact with felt cost of time against rot. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient preservation emerges organically from seeds/ropes/fulgurite particulars; final sentinel image offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting indifference with eternal bloom, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person Elias POV with perceptual signature (tenacity motifs, oceanic similes); voice rhythmic/poetic, modulates hush to awe; dialogue natural/subtextual (Kael's gruff "cursed" yields "teach my boy"), distinct idiolects.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hush sentences to flowing decodings); purposeful lyric figuration coherent (kelp current, lightning ghost). Minor artifact: "infinitely patient" thrice risks template but motif-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot ciphers/fulgurite decoder transforms folklore into tactile preservation quest; bold poetic risks heighten without gimmick, inevitable pact from particulars.</comment>
