<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spatial gift concretely enables photon tracing and pattern prediction; Mira's obsession drives micro-choices like deeper entry and algorithm refinement. Internal conflict emerges in tension between clinging threats and release, embodied in pulse quickening during encounter. Minor slip: emotions slightly abstract in "quiet wildfire" repetition without fuller contradiction in peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spore interactions and Elias dialogue build density to CR closure in "She had understood," reweighting security premise with conceptual cost of surrender. Orientation anchored early in farm entry; single scene with one tightening via rat test narrowing to calibrated release. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent spores as living veil constrain laser test and charge final image of yielding barriers; sensory details (phosphorescence hum, drifting embers) filtered through Mira's spatial priorities integrate with action. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism, evolving causally with spore plumes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revolutionize via letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through Elias collaboration and rat ripple to stance crystallization in permeable tracking. Agency in beam activation and on-spot refinement forecloses resistance path with felt cost in transformed prototype. One meaningful deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of permeability emerges organically from spore diffraction, luciferin release, and encounter, culminating in non-literal CR: "letting go wasn't loss, but luminous freedom" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "familiar stranger" gesture charges recognition as catalyst; ambiguity lingers in wildfire's banked burn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with spatial perceptual signature in "four dimensions, predicting refractions"; voice rhythm modulates from hushed entry to ignited mind. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Permeable barriers"), distinguishing Elias's grower idiom from Mira's. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "beam slicing through the spore cloud" advances plot, setting, theme); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening but coherent (fire/light motifs); peak clarity intact at "beam whispered through barriers."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of biolum farm, laser security, and quantum letting-go transforms intrusion tropes via spore mechanics and stranger catalyst. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes in quiet intimacy; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
