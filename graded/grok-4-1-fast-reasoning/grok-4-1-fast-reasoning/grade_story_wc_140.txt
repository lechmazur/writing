<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with concrete perceptual bias (overlaid visions) and embodied textures (gritty, velvety); motivation roots in erasure flaw, compelling micro-choices like pursuing fragments despite tides; earned change at revelation forecloses nameless void with sabotage cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: fragment density builds to CR closure where tangible label convulses reality, un-erasing history; cost legible in "their own 'death' night... sabotage"; orientation anchored early in docks/labyrinth; one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tides as micro-setting constrain choices (low exposes paths, high forces retreats) and charge climax (breached hull at ebb); sensory selection (creak, salt, fog) filters through warped POV; coherent choreography amid stacks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture/identity) signaled early, escalates via fragment density to cadence shift at label find; agency in collecting/layering narrows nameless options; cost felt in survived sabotage, charging final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from layered particulars, reweighted non-literally in "memories' weave complete"; ambiguity lingers in reclaimed yet textured identity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (translucent skins, spectral overlays); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, echoing layering; overheard snippets natural/subtextual; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figuratives (barnacle, corroded filings) integrated into action; minor overwriting in descriptive runs but no loops/artifacts dulling closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perceptual layering in erased port-ghosts transforms identity trope; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable at label climax; no derivatives.</comment>
