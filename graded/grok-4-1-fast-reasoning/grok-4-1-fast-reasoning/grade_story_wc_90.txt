<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pacifist motivation drives integration choices consistently, with embodied holographic tremors and contradictory rage/guilt impulses acting in the stitching scene; earned lightness from pivotal joy shift forecloses denial path with felt wholeness cost. Minor therapy-speak in "shadow work" echoes flattens peak epiphany specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadow density builds to pattern break at joy-uncovering stitch, yielding on-page RR (portal opens via integrated tapestry) with conceptual cost of embraced darkness legible in final image; single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recycled ship's patched hull, faded photo mosaic, and tear-shimmers constrain choices (activate portal, supply ink) and charge closure (tapestry press); sensory hierarchy narrows to visual/physical glows under internal crisis, mirroring turmoil via despair images.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (non-violent integration to open dimension) signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening shadow layers to agency-driven joy reversal, narrowing denial options; visible cost (festering rot visions, frailty acceptance) alters tactics and charges final breach image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of merciful shadow alchemy emerges organically from stitching particulars, reweighting pacifism via frailty-joy realization without moralizing; final golden mist fissure offers non-literal resonant answer to violence-quarantine premise, lingering with integrated-darkness ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV ethereal texture with biased perceptual signature (spectral fireflies, luminous filaments) modulates rhythmically under pressure; whisper dialogue goal-driven (rejects fight), subtext-laden; purposeful poetic compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., photos amplify stitching); varied rhythm supports propulsion, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (mist/shimmers/fireflies) during peak integration slightly muddles clarity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human hologram alchemy transforms tropes (AI guardian, mythic tear) via pacifist stitching mechanic; risk-taking in accumulative shadow-weave heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at tapestry-pierce.</comment>
