<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation intensely rooted in brother's famine death compels high-stakes choices like prying the wailing tip free; embodied emotion in "gaunt cheeks tightened" and stress-degraded perception feel particular. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, earning final planting with visible cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from launch to discovery to extraction to revival; orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with "roots quickening" reconfiguration and felt familial cost. Persistent constraint of inversion shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward rivers constrain navigation choices via water flow method; glider as tool limits maneuvers in narrowing throat. Final soil planting charges image with orchard salute mirroring internal state. Sensory hierarchy (hum, breathing, frothing) reflects pilot urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sourcing resilience signaled early tightens via causal discovery/removal reversal, narrowing options with wailing echoes complication; agency in pocketing despite vines retracting forecloses safe path. Cost legible in tremor/memories and prior family loss. Escalation driven by inversion pressure culminates in charged planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from echo nexus amplifying survival, reweighted by arrow's cataclysm memory flooding Elara. Final "orchards would thrive again" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtle counter-reading in disruption cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with pilot-specific perceptual signature in "rivers...threading like liquid starlight." Rhythmic control modulates with intensity, compression under stress purposeful. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to flows/hums.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "vines retracting in shock" advancing action/atmosphere; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (echoes as "smoke from stone lips") without muddle in peaks. "Whirling silence" motif taught early propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverting gravity orchards, echo symphony, and rune-etched conductor transforms tropes organically; arrow breakage birthing resonance feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold inversion physics heightens stakes without gimmickry, charging closure image.</comment>
