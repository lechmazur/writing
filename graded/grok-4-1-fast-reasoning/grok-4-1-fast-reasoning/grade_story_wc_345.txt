<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Archetypal roles (botanist, mechanic) with traits told via labels rather than embodied micro-choices; internal conflicts summarized ("doubt thorned their unity") without simultaneous impulses in pivotal doubt beat before bell-hauling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via message density building to on-page RR (butterflies pull nebula, blight ends) with felt cost of overcome hesitations; backstory summary creates mild causality dilution but orientation anchors early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and brambles vividly constrain choices (bell hauled to arch shadow) and charge closure image of revived orchards; sensory selection (lavender skies, nebula hues) purposeful and POV-filtered through survivors' labor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard blight) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through messages narrowing doubt-options to collective ring; cost legible in "hesitations" voiced pre-climax, charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-unity emerges organically from message motifs shifting to "family reexamines"; resonant non-literal closure in thriving leaves echoes brambled hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent poetic third-person collective voice with perceptual bias toward orchard textures; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Why trust a ghost?" reveals status shift); rhythmic control heightens pressure at bell-chime.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Figurative density (thorns, roots) consistent but borders overwriting in opening exposition; minor loops ("strangers became family," "strangely trustworthy") dull early propulsion, though closure image propels crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchard-ghost mythos with nebula mechanics transforming unity trope; risk in collective agency pays off in butterfly/nebula closure without gimmickry.</comment>
