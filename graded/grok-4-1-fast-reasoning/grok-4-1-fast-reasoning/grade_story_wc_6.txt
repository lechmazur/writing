<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in scars and compassion drives the grafting ritual; embodied emotions via forearms' burn marks and father's legacy create credible endurance. Internal conflict emerges subtly in heritage tension but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal graft beat. Final renunciation of father's shadow feels earned with visible cost in whispered line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early in lagoon descent. One tightening via precise graft execution narrows options to healing act. Cost legible in final image: "father's shadow yielding to harmony" reconfigures legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and kelp constrain graft site choice and charge final peace image; sensory details (glassy waters, volcanic grit) filtered through firefighter vigilance. Rootstock and black sand as micro-settings evolve with action, mirroring internal scars without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal scars/land) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ritual beats to stance crystallization. Agency in scion fit and coin binding forecloses destructive legacy path with felt cost in skin grafts parallel. No reversals needed; deepening reweights via on-page union.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of scars harmonizing emerges organically from graft particulars and scar/rootstock parallels, reweighting destruction-to-song without moralizing. Final whisper and kelp reprise offer non-literal resonant answer, embracing ambiguity in lingering legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (wind/warmth attunement) biases setting notices; lyrical rhythm modulates to quiet triumph. No dialogue; purposeful compression in ritual taught early, legible at closure. Minor filter excess in preparatory moves but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density risks overwriting in graft beat ("pulverized midnight," "puckered wounds"); draft artifacts ("Wait, over—trim," "No, restart") create scaffold loops obscuring closure cadence. Rhythmic variety strong overall, but paraphrase in "kelp-drift peace" repeats dulls propulsion; info-dense otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of arson-firefighter graft ritual with talisman binding transforms trope of legacy scars into fresh "scars can sing" premise. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes via volcanic idiom; final harmony reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
