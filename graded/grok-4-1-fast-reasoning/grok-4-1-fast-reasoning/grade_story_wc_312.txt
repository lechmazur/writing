<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elowen's brittle devotion fracturing under doubt then tempering to resilience shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, with micro-choices like charting drips and piercing channels earning the final strike. Embodied stress in shaking hands and sweat amid cold air reveals character under pressure. Minor label-speak ("earnestly naive") slightly abstracts interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip patterns build density from chaos to sync, culminating in on-page RR closure via bell toll normalizing drips/stars with felt cost of Elowen's fatigue/slump. Orientation anchored early (viaduct apex, post-last-fish). Single continuous scene fits defaults; surge cracking repair tightens pressure without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's dripping tears as cosmic metronome constrain repair tactics (charting rates, channeling drips) and charge final normalized rhythm image. Sensory hierarchy (visual blue hues, chill dew, erratic patters) filters through Elowen's maritime lore bias. Selective dawn progression mirrors internal persistence without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (right imbalance via bell rebuild) signaled early; accumulative escalation via pattern emergence, repair surge widening crack, deeper divining forcing refocus with tactic-altering cost (fatigue, faltering spells). Agency in persistence/endurance forecloses doubt path. Climax toll reweights stakes undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile faith mending vast rents emerges organically from drip-sync persistence and grandmother's lore, with final "small acts mend vast rents" image resonating non-literally. Subtext in "lukewarm mend the broken worlds" mutter layers complexity without moralizing until late. Minor drift toward platitude in closing swell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: naive prophecy in drip patterns, selective notice of maritime cues. Voice texture modulates from earnest description to compressed urgency in repair surge ("hands shook, brittle devotion fracturing"). One muttered line feels goal-driven, natural under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting in peak repair ("cracks spidering inward then sealing with resonant chimes") mixes metaphors across high-pressure beats, dulling propulsion (−0.6). Repetitive stems ("brittle devotion" thrice, naive echoes) create template cadence. Rhythm varies but closure image clear.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drip-metronome repair and lukewarm mage legend transforms cosmic imbalance trope via specific maritime logic and plausible impossibility tone. Risky accumulative pattern from chaos to harmony feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
