<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Finn's arc from isolation to signing the finale feels earned through Elara's pull and embodied reactions like pulse quickening; Elara's traits drive choices consistently. Minor slip: interiority relies on stock mesmerization without deeper contradictory impulses in peak disruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence-mapping density builds to festival halt; closure as Conceptual Repricing ("Silence mapped is music eternal") reconfigures noise into quiet with bittersweet cost legible in crowd's tears and Finn's remembrance. Orientation anchored early on pier; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor's moonlight shimmers integrate purposefully, mirroring internal hush and framing silences via camera; recurring waves constrain mapping tactic and charge final dissolution image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs. festival noise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mapping to bold disruption, narrowing options with crowd response; agency in joint signing forecloses noise path with felt emotional cost on crowd and Finn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges organically from signs, camera frames, and disruption; final image of harmonious quiet offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting noise as loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward silences; poetic rhythm modulates with intensity, dialogue natural in whispers/signs carrying subtext of invitation and translation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("liquid moonlight," repeated "joyful sorrow") creates slight coherence drag without touching closure; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign-language silence-mapping with film-less camera transforms disruption trope into poignant lyric conceit; risk-taking in silent symphony heightens stakes organically.</comment>
