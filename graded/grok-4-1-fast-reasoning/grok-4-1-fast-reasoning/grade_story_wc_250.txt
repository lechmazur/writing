<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's silent empathy and micro-choices in weaving reveal consistent traits and motivation rooted in guardianship; Umbra's transformation feels earned through patterned intensification. Minor abstraction in embodied emotion slightly detaches peak revelation of Umbra's fractures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building to RR closure (Umbra's softening with conceptual cost of vulnerability). Continuous scene anchors orientation early; weave's causal progression narrows oblivion to harmony without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's slick planks and puddles constrain and amplify the weave's luminous tapestries on canal surface, charging final reflections. Sensory details (shimmering planks, mist air) selectively mirror internal states through Elara's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching stars' value) signaled early; escalation via intensifying patterns pierces Umbra, forcing recoil and trade-off in balance. Cost legible in tendril's tremble and eternal vigil's unspoken price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light-dark balance emerges organically from weave's progression to spiral galaxy cradling voids; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like falling star pattern avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature biases toward poetic noticing of shadows/light; rhythmic syntax modulates with weave's hypnotic intensification. No head-hopping; voice texture distinct and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload (vortex, fluttering threads) in weave climax muddles slightly with mixed vehicles; minor paraphrase loops in "spiralingly calm" repeats. Rhythm varies read-aloud effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic guardian teaching shadow via shutters/mirror weave transforms tropes into tactile poetry; risk in silent, pattern-driven arc heightens stakes organically. Final twilight harmony feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
