<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motive to learn the building language intensifies credibly through pretense and interrogation, with Harlan applying relational pressure; internal conflict emerges in shared lies but leans toward summary over simultaneous impulses in rooftop scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as teas build density to rooftop RR closure ("our lies dissolve"); orientation anchored early (Victorian, Elm Street); one tightening via confession suffices, cost legible in seal handoff and building reply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop garden with jasmine and Perseids constrains revelation timing, mirroring groans and charging seal's pulse; sensory details (meteors, steaming mugs) filter through Elara's whisper-attuned POV without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock building tongue) signaled via groans, deepens accumulatively through lies to interrogation turn; Elara's agency forces Harlan's confession, with cost in facade crack and path commitment felt on rooftop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Agreed lies theme emerges organically via pretense and dissolution, reweighted in final fluency without moral; subtext in parries and seal invites ambiguity on arcane costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with whisper-biased perception; dialogue subtextual ("you hear them too") advances pressure; rhythmic texture modulates from parlor hum to meteor urgency without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density, but minor loops ("patiently nimble," "mysterious familiarity") and paraphrase in lie descriptions slightly drag mid-section without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Buildings-as-speakers transforms haunted trope via linguistic seal lexicon; rooftop meteor synthesis feels inevitable, risking arcane commitment over generic ghost reveal.</comment>
