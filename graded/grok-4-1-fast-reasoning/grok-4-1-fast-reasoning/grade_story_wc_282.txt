<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to voice the unknown intensifies through embodied fears during fossil resonance, compelling the vow and float; contradictory impulses between mapping knowns and embracing voids act in the destabilization beat. Final transformation earned via prior micro-choices like gripping the fossil. Minor epiphanic summary in legacy paragraphs slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from mapping to floating orbs interfacing implants, culminating in Charged Poise RR at descent and fossil etch, with cost in overload stabilization and final release. Orientation anchored early in cave/post-hibernation setup. Continuous scene with no shards fits defaults; closure cost legible in "gently, she descended" and "released it into the tide."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coastal cave's bioluminescent veins, salt spray, and fissure to abyss constrain float and voice projection, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (thermal auras over visual) reflects map-maker POV. Fossil as micro-setting evolves tactilely, mirroring internal states. 9+ gate met via cave/ocean pressuring transition to unmapped sea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice unknown) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fossil's destabilization forcing resolve stabilization; agency in pressing fossil to chest forecloses mapped-only path with overload cost. Escalation driven by her choices under lens, cost unmistakable in thermal overheating threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transitional objects theme emerges organically from fossil handoff of human emotions to Lira's voice, reweighting past/future bridge in release to tide without moralizing. Final image of lingering thermal echoes answers "voice the unknown" resonantly. Subtext in emotional fractals avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in heat-map filters (e.g., "cold blues and curiosity's warm oranges"); lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing in float climax. Whispered vow and amplified echo carry subtext; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "thermal fractals" amid float) risks muddle in peak destabilization without full pattern payoff; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Rhythmic variety supports ear test; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Factually mystical fossils amplifying emotions into floats transforms post-apoc artifact trope via heat-map science-magic synthesis, risking lyrical sci-fantasy for fresh emotional cartography; inevitable in hindsight from early map-maker setup. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
