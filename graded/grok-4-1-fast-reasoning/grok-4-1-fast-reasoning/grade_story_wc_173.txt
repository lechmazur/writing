<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to defy conformity intensifies compellingly to climax lunge; chastity trait enables pivotal untangling with implied isolation cost. Interiority concrete in gestures but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with echo density tightening to sanctuary bloom as RR closure; cost legible in crowd faltering and lullaby fracture. Orientation anchored instantly in courtyard ritual; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow, loom, threads constrain choices vividly, charging final sanctuary image; sensory selection (flakes, sighs, prisms) mirrors urgency. Starlit snow evolution culminates pivotal payoff without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy lullaby) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thread releases narrowing conformity's hold; agency in poetic untangling forces trade-off at resistant knot. Crowd serenity cost crystallizes in stirring realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rebellion-through-purity theme emerges organically from chaste dance vs. echoes; final rebel smile reweights conformity premise without moralizing. Particulars like threads drive resonance over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in bodily poetry; rhythmic diction modulates intensity purposefully. Voice texture distinct in syntax arcs mimicking dance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pervasive metaphors and "poetic" loops (e.g., "bodily poetic" thrice in climax beat) create artifact density dulling propulsion; paraphrase churn in crowd "serenity/alarm" descriptions. Closure image holds but muddled by figurative stack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste rebellion via thread-untangling dance transforms courtesan trope; prism sanctuary payoff inevitable from accumulative echoes. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
