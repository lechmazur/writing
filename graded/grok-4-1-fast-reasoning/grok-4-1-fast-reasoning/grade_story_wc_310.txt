<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to align wavelengths compels coin casts amid doubt visions, earning final sync; contradictory enthusiasm vs. doubt acts in persistent action despite peer failures. Interiority concrete via burst discernment, but abstract labels like "quietly enthusiastic" slightly dilute embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as distilled bursts density-build to Charged Poise closure at beacon ignition ("wavelengths synced at last"), reconfiguring doubt with conceptual cost of reversed tide; orientation anchored in first paragraph's deck/contraction setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber deck constrains coin spills and relic activation, charging final pulse image; selective sensory hum/crackle reflects Elara's cosmic priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment vs. dissolution) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through core burst revelation narrowing doubt options; agency in lot casts forces trade-off, cost felt in "stellar doubt trembled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversed doubt-to-harmony emerges organically from burst distillations, final beacon image resonantly reweights prophecy without stated moral; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic poetic voice with perceptual signature for static patterns stable in single POV; syntax/rhythm modulates intensity during distillations without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density propels, but repetitive phrasing ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt" x5) creates paraphrase loops in mid-distillation beats, dulling peak momentum; minor mixed metaphors (fossil/ember) risk opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy in contracted cosmos ingeniously transforms divination tropes via coin-guided bursts; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risking bold cosmic reversal payoff.</comment>
