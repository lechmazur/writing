<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn belonging's rhythm drives concrete micro-choices like pocketing the feather and interpreting it as a cosmic key, earning the final bond; Theo applies relational pressure as exile guarding secrets. Interiority particular through stellar harmonies in ruins, with embodied wonder at fireflies. Minor tidiness in epiphany slightly softens contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solo exploration to shared vigil, tightening via feather discovery and exhale to CR closure where belonging reconfigures isolation with felt relational cost in hand-holding and feather's reprise. Orientation anchored early in submersible slip through dome. Single continuous scene fits scope; no shard transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via fractured dome, silted console, and viewport lens shaping vigil and exhale choice; bioluminescent pulses and warm currents evolve causally with firefly swarm. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to astral/topographic (coral-veiled spires channeling harmonies). Final atrium flood charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging's rhythm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Theo encounter and feather mapping to cadence shift at exhale revealing fireflies, forcing stance crystallization in bond. Agency in captivating tales narrows isolation options; cost legible in dissolving solitude. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from feather's comet unity, firefly interweave, and shared breath without statement; final image reweights prior solitary charting into relational pulse. Subtext in murmurs and tentative hand; ambiguity lingers in unspoken pact. Resonant non-literal answer in "seamless interweave."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (constellations from geometries); voice texture modulates poetically yet controlled, diction biased to astral/topo (e.g., "shadowseam wonder"). Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("it's a map"), advances bond. No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., glove brush dislodges feather advancing plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, syntax propels to climax exhale. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ethereal prisms across coral-veiled spires") but pattern-taught and legible, not obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater astrology, comet feather bridging realms, firefly exhale ritual transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens shadow/light stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight in predawn realization from prior particulars.</comment>
