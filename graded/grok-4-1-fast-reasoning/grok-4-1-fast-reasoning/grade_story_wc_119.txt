<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in fortune slip and specs discovery intensifies compellingly to high-stakes orchestration; interiority concrete with embodied tension in "trembling hands" and "heart pounding a new rhythm." Final change from observer to maestro earned via micro-choices like hasty cookie baking. Minor flaw: backstory whispers slightly summarize prior prophetic aid without full on-page tilt to present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: specs find → fortune rewrite → beam transposition = DC closure with legible cost in spies' trap and Elias's exposed role. Orientation anchored early in tavern post-last orders. Single scene with smooth ascent/descent shards; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and rocky shoals constrain climax choice, charging final image of "chaos converging like notes in a symphony." Sensory details (howling wind, creaking beams, fog) selective via Elias's fog-cloaked solitude, mirroring internal shift. Evolving environment (twisted beam) mirrors stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transpose stagnant life via unmasking) signaled in cookie augury, tightens via spies' arrival forcing beam risk with felt cost in pounding heart and locals' cheers implying relational shift. Agency in cookie trap and Morse flashes drives escalation under causal lens. One reversal sufficient; moral calculus in betraying open secret adds depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets-to-orchestration emerges organically from fortunes' shift from accidental to intentional leaks, resonating in final "bold new key" without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and beam control invites ambiguity on locals' complicity. Final image reweights prophecy premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual bias (enigmas as "old friends"); rhythmic texture modulates from contemplative to tense in lantern room wait. Spies' brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("cookie drop's true"), goal-driven. No head-hopping; voice particular in fog/cloak metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short flashes in climax). Patterned "directing flow"/"transpose" repetition taught early, propels without loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("rusty lock," "minor key") slightly muddles peak but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies as spy bait and lighthouse beam as conductor transforms tropes organically; cookie specs embedding feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky premise commits fully, heightening ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
