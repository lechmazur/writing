<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transmute pain roots consistently in her archival traits and intensifies via communal sharing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; idealization softens flaws without complicating peak choices like narrating the mosaic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solo puzzling to communal gathering and tears; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "laughter bubbled... spread in whimsical waves," reconfiguring grief with felt emotional cost in confessions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (lavender scent veiling wounds, vines' audible climb) filters through Elara's perceptual calm, constraining choices like kneeling amid blooms for arrangement; charges final image as "verdant, aromatic haven" mirroring healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute pain) signaled early tightens accumulatively via photo arcs to townsfolk confessions narrowing isolation; cost legible in tears tracing "arcs down cheeks," though agency more guiding than agonized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing emerges organically from photo arcs shifting pain to luminescence, resisting tidy morals via shared scars; final "masterpiece etched in time" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting ruins motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in arc-noticing; voice texture modulates whimsy to melodic narration ("See here, where the beam's fatal bend arcs..."), though minor register elevation in descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive motif churn ("vines climbing" 6+ times, "linger" 4x, "earnest whimsy" 4x) creates paraphrase loops across descriptive beats, dulling propulsion; figurative density overwrites high-pressure gathering without crisp payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle archiving as healing in ruins/lavender transforms abandonment trope; risk in poetic arcs motif heightens stakes organically to communal reconfiguration.</comment>
