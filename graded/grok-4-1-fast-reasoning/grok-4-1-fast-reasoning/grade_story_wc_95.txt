<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via duel revelation, with mechanical arm embodying past cost and present precision; dialogue reveals traits under pressure. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; alliance feels earned but lacks deeper internal friction shown on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: deciphering leads to mid-duel reveal ("Coded in the sundial"), yielding alliance as RR/Charged Poise. Closure cost legible in Lang's yield and handshake, with sundial constraint persisting to final image ("angles now pointing true north"). Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial constrains deciphering choice and charges closure ("gleamed, angles now pointing true north"); brook evolves (murmurs to mist-veil) mirroring tension. Sensory hierarchy sharp (fractured light, whirring gears, pattering rain); spatial choreography coherent through circling duel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duel + Academy alliance) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven reveal mid-clash slipping Lang's guard. Cost visible in yield and rivalry foreclosure; Causal escalation coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of questions-to-destinations emerges organically via duel barbs and alliance; final image ("questions became their shared path") offers non-literal resonance reweighting premise. No moralizing; complexity in rival creeds without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (geometric focus via needle card); dialogue distinct, goal-driven ("Your destinations breed wars"). Rhythmic control modulates tension; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Density high with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifacts: "dignified chaos" and "diplomatically fierce" loops slightly dull mid-duel peak without obscuring closure; no filter stacks or major muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophy, cipher-sundial intrigue, mechanical arm in steampunk-ish frame; risk in mid-duel reveal transforms tropes organically. Turn feels inevitable from cipher setup; no derivative hedging.</comment>
