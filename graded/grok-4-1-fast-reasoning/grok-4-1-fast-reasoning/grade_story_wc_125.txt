<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict peaks in the rope-wrapping choice, earned by flashes of roadside life and contradictory freedom vs. depth impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layer-uncovering density to CR closure: integration fuses rope with energy, reweighting impossible choices as illusion with freedom's felt cost legible in "no longer just a drifter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls amplify beings' hum and constrain rope-laying ritual, charging final emergence under starlight-fractured fissures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to grasp time's texture tightens texturally through pattern layers to binary fork, forcing integrative agency with freedom's visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time as frayed weave emerges organically; final fusion offers non-literal answer that reweights choices without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature—poetic noticing of spirals, pulses—modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable close-third POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels but minor patterned repetition ("frayed," "patterns") borders loop without obscuring fusion climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-energy communion transforms tropes; risk-taking in textural layer-build heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
