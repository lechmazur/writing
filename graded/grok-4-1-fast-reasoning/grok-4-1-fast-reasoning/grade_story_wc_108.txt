<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's phobia-driven micro-choices, like pressing shell to cast despite dread, earn her climax lunge; contradictory fear/precision impulses act in scene. Harlan's blanching reveals his flaw under pressure. Minor label-speak ("Firmly adaptive") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: betrayal memory → library discovery → decryption → phobia reveal → DC at cliff shove with risk cost legible in "phobia screaming." Draft notes obscure final beats but do not break traceability. Single scene, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliff library constrains climax swing/shove, warping shelves supply lion's tome; moonlight shadows charge final stand under stars. Sensory filter (salt-warped iron, sea roar) embodies phobia POV bias. Evolving decay mirrors adaptive shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim truth via vulnerability) tightens causally through decryption reversal, forcing agency in phobia admission/shove; visible cost in embodied terror during lunge forecloses Harlan's control. Coherent pressure to Charged Poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (phobias as power post-betrayal) emerges via shell-reweighted fears constraining choices to climax proof; final silent shell offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like cast notes ground resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via phobia lens ("clawing like old friends"); dialogue sparse but subtext-rich ("perfect echo"). Rhythm modulates tension, though minor register elevation in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Draft scaffolds ("No—word count overrun," "[wait, cap]") and ending paraphrase loops dull closure propulsion; overwrought metaphors ("rusted blade") mix without pattern in climax. Template phrasing ("Firmly adaptive") creates churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Magical shell decrypting phobia for stunt double's outwit transforms betrayal trope via adaptive vulnerability; cliff seashell synthesis feels inevitable and risks lyric tone payoff.</comment>
