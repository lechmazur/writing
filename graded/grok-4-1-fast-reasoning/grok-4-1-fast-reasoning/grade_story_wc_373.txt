<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in father's death, driving persistent micro-choices through false starts; interiority concrete in fraying nerves contrasting steadfast resolve. Internal conflict emerges in cracked voice and fumbled lies, embodied in pounding heart and heavy fob. Final success earned via escalating attempts, but lacks deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: false starts link progressively to dangling fob cry as DC, shattering truce with chaos and captured sound; orientation anchored early in pier market at twilight. One tightening sufficient as sunrise forces final act. Closure cost legible in scarred hush and lingering unease image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (salt, guts, lanterns) filters through Lila's urgent bias, constraining climbs and slips; rotting timbers mirror fraying nerves and charge final scatter. Micro-setting (pier pilings, boot cylinder) guides choices, evolves with dawn. Proportionate focus avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart deal via trust break) signaled early, escalates causally through three false starts narrowing to sunrise desperation; agency in climbing/dangling forces runner's steel draw. Cost visible in thwarted parley and Lila's scarred market legacy. One decisive tightening coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile hush emerges organically from failed attempts to final shatter, reweighted by playback echo as pa's breath; fob reprise shifts from accusation to readiness. Subtext in comforting unease lingers without moralizing. Final image offers resonant CR on reforming shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in repeated unease motif; voice rhythmic, modulating tension via short sentences in climax shouts. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("shine for your pa's ghost?"), advances via leers/darts. No head-hopping, diction fits rough idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long atmospheric opens to punchy climax cries), density high in integrated senses/actions; minor loops in "curiously steadfast"/"comforting unease" repetitions purposeful but border ornamental (-0.4). No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonshine/pirate hush with sound-capture motive transforms revenge trope; wax cylinder ingenuity inevitable from boot hide to playback. Risky poetic voice heightens unease without gimmick; fob evolution personalizes premise.</comment>
