<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to chart discovery compels noting and activation choices with embodied thrill; sociable isolation trait reveals through chatter to objects amid peril, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as symbol density and luminance brighten to rift coordinates; palm press delivers Charged Poise RR with cost legible in radiant dome repelling birds and clutched notes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hopscotch board micro-setting constrains decoding choice and charges activation image; starling murmurations evolve to batter sails, mirroring isolation reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Murmurations intensify to batter sails, forcing activation under accumulative lens; agency in noting and pressing forecloses grounding peril with shuddering ship cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sociable isolation to shared wonders emerges via pattern unveiling and final cheer; resonant dispersal image answers discovery's connective theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with pattern-selective perception; sociable self-dialogue carries subtext and modulates under bird pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
