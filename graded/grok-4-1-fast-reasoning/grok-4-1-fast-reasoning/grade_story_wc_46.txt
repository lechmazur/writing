<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in vow and trauma, compelling polishing and sharing with embodied contradiction (longing skies vs. earthbound duty). Final unburdening earned by prior causality in grotto work. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("memories now flowed not as torment but as allies") slightly softens raw flaw persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resurfacing memories and polishing builds to Charged Poise closure in village sharing, reconfiguring earthbound state with felt cost of reframed longing. Orientation anchored early in grotto. One tightening via successful pearl emergence narrows to communal test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto's mist, sands, and seawater constrain polishing method, charging final beacon image. Sensory details (cool edges, rhythmic lap) selective via Elara's priorities, mirroring internal turmoil. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe light-sharing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory density during polishing, forcing venture and village test. Agency in deliberate strokes forecloses fire-risk path with village's torch-weary pressure. Cost legible in earthbound endurance crystallized at dawn sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of memories as bridges emerges organically from polishing particulars, resonant in final grotto pulsing with shared wonder. No moralizing; ambiguity in vow's "chain to choice" lingers. Sea glass reprise reweights light-sharing without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (starlight through haze). Voice poetic but modulates minimally under stress. Single dialogue line ("See") natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("memories resurfaced"/"resurfacing" x6+, "zephyr"/"bloom"/"mist" loops) creates paraphrase churn, dulling density in polishing beat. Overwritten metaphors (e.g., "celestial petals unfurling") pervade without pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion. Final third artifacts cap high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-watcher lore and sea-glass alchemy transforms isolation tropes into communal beacon legacy. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative templates; closure feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
