<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait drives persistent proof-building amid futility, with contradictory daring/calculation embodied in dice-guided equations; final endurance of climbing post-rupture earned by layered regrets. Backstory of missed leap anchors present via chipped die, tilting micro-choices like hurling dice. Minor label-like "grim optimism" phrasing slightly generic but shown through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: proofs layer density to rupture (DC attempt), reforming stairs deliver CR with cost in "proofs etched into steps behind him, a trail of grim hope, perpetual in their futility." Orientation anchored instantly; single continuous scene tightens via dice rolls and equations to charged poise in endless climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains ascent/proofs, dice as micro-setting handled tactilely (rolling, clattering) charges final pocketed chipped die; sensory glow, humming, buckling steps evolve with action, mirroring internal texture. Final blurring into "golden mean helix" recharges premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rupture confinement via perpetual motion proofs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through dice-perturbed equations narrowing to hurl/rupture; agency in model-building forecloses escape with cost of reformed stairs. Climax rupture tests commitment but coincidence (reality recoil) complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of futile optimism in regret's texture emerges via proofs/dice mirroring missed leap, final "texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of eternal dare. No moralizing; ambiguity in "free in confinement" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (texture-obsessed noticing: "gritty regret," "wind's kiss"); rhythmic prose modulates from steady climb to pounding heart, syntax reflects grim precision. No dialogue; purposeful surreal compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates math metaphors into action without loops; rhythm varies (short "But energy dissipates" punches, long integrals breathe). Minor overuse of "texture" (4x) borders churn but pattern-taught as motif; no scaffold, propulsion peaks at "staircase groaned."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis: math proofs on infinite stairs transform perpetual motion trope into regret engine, dice asymmetry enables rupture; risk in helical vortex/quantum unification inevitable from traits, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
