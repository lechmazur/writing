<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via narrated regrets acting simultaneously with physical struggle; final change from uncertain to certain earned through progressive mending. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "fractured soul" borders therapy-speak but embodied in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via pockmark matches quilting memories toward RR closure; statue cracking open delivers on-page reconfiguration with conceptual cost of embraced flaws. Orientation anchored early; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea and statue pockmarks constrain choices (breath limits, corrosion) and charge final image (repelling acid, barge lifting). Sensory hierarchy narrows to caustic haze and chill flank under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend soul before drowning) signaled early, tightens via accumulative pattern of deepening regrets per pockmark; agency in narration/matching forecloses doubt with felt cost in "last air." One decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from mending actions, reweighted in final image of glowing pockmarks quilting tapestry; resonant non-literal answer to breaks-as-strength without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (alchemical noticing of scars, gold veins); rhythmic modulation under stress via compressed gasps. Minor register elevation in peak metaphors fits voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but −0.6 for figurative overload in climax ("kintsugi intentions surged...veins spidering") and paraphrase loops in pockmark narrations dulling pressure slightly; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-alchemy on acid-sea barge transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
