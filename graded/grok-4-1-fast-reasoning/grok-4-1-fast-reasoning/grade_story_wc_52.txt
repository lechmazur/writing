<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied grief (hands steady despite ache) drive micro-choices in carving, earning shift to resilience; minor epiphanic phrasing like "lesson bloomed" slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through carving beats to Charged Poise closure ("she snapped the locket shut... contained eternity while it boiled"); cost legible in time's pressure vs. eternity gained; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skylight's rust-hued glow and rain patter constrain ritual focus and charge final image; chisel/wood as micro-setting enable choices; sensory hierarchy (steam threading, wood dust sifting) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain memories before "gone") deepens texturally as kettle escalates ("whistle threatening"); agency in chiseling forecloses tea time with felt cost; one tightening sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting ephemeral roar emerges organically from carving memories, reweighted in final image (locket vs. shrieking kettle) without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (circus-haunted lyricism: "rust-hued peace"); rhythm modulates from meditative to urgent; purposeful elevated diction fits widow's ingenuity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated (e.g., "grief's forge") supporting propulsion; minor repetition of "here and gone" purposeful under textural lens, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus magic (crystallized time in locket) transforms widow's grief trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative form heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
