<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's steadily curious trait drives consistent actions like unspooling the tape, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Theo applies pressure via confiding the letter, yet interiority remains more declarative than embodied. Final shared legacy feels earned but without deeper relational cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from Theo's knock to ink shimmer on World reversed; orientation anchored early in loft post-crash; CR closure lands via "map reborn in onyx and measure" with conceptual cost of warned future duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and loft constrain isolation from chaos, charging final image as "rain's beads tracing new secrets"; tape as micro-setting shapes mapping choices; sensory hierarchy (patter amplifying pulse) mirrors pattern revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel mystery tightens accumulatively via letter confided then paths multiplied to new pattern; agency in Elara's precise spacing forecloses solitary quest with shared cost; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cultural folly mapping emerges organically from inked Tower to Fibonacci echo, reweighting greed cycles non-literally in resurgence ledger image; ambiguity lingers in next mania warning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual bias toward patterns (e.g., "fractal veins"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Greed as the new god") advances plot; rhythmic modulation peaks in "loft seemed to hum."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (rain motifs propel atmosphere); minor paraphrase loops ("steadily curious," rain patter) but no closure touch; varied rhythm passes ear test, overwriting in figuration controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Onyx-ink tarot reverse-engineering synthesizes crypto crash via cultural myths originally; risk in fractal paths/measuring transforms cartomancy trope; inevitable hindsight from Tower bleed to 42.7 cm payoff.</comment>
