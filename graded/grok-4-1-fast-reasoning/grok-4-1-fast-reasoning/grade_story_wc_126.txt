<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lir's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished intensifies credibly through embodied actions like unbinding his family's echo, with clear interior conflict in fearing incompleteness shown when he finally plays it. Survivors apply relevant pressure as storytellers, revealing Lir's values via micro-choices. Minor flaw: internal impulses harmonize more than contradict simultaneously in peak rite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound fragments build density to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration: hush cracks with "rippling outward," reweighting stakes via shared murmurs and apple bud image carrying conceptual cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/shipwrecks; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards. Final unbinding of family echo lands decisive reconfiguration with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shipwrecks amplify echoes, constraining Lir's violin performance and charging closure hum/tinkle; sunken branches sway in applause, mirroring internal unbinding. Sensory hierarchy (acoustic focus) reflects Lir's trait; biolum plankton and bonfire evolve with rite. Final bud tremble integrates setting to recharge unfinished motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind hush via echoes against resistance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through layered stories to own echo's deepening, narrowing options via hush thickening then cracking. Agency in calling survivors and playing forces stance crystallization; cost legible in Lir's feared vulnerability paid at "violin weeping."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges from particulars like half-formed sounds/stories, resonant in closure's "unbinding... unfinished yet whole" without statement. Final apple bud and "echoes followed" reweight premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of "what might yet be." No moralizing; irony in hush pierced by tradition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature acoustic-biased; voice modulates rhythmically with rite intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., "This hush binds us... stories unbind." Prose texture distinct without leakage; experimental poetic compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, density high, but patterned artifacts: "unfinished" x8, "hush" repetitions create paraphrase loops in ending stanzas dulling propulsion. Minor template cadence in survivor descriptions ("shadows slipping," "faces etched"); no closure harm but drags final third. Strong verbs/images offset overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn echo-harbor with violin unbinding transforms tropes into acoustic ritual; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Core premise (sound-fragments as unfinished beauty) inevitable in hindsight via bowl-to-bonfire progression. No derivatives; bold vision coheres.</comment>
