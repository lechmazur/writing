<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to prove listening heals drives patient clue-piecing amid neighbors' tales; embodied in repeated "sandstorm calm" revealing steady poise under intrusion. Minor slip: internal conflict light, lacking contradictory impulses in climax choice to open mailbox.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as stories densify clues to 1952 code; closure RR at "mailbox yielded... spilling envelopes" with tears as felt cost reconfiguring divides. One tightening via intrusion forcing refocus; orientation anchored early at thrift store.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard's fountain/oak/moss constrain trail "past fountain to oak's roots"; jasmine/dew sensory filter Elena's discerning eye, charging final locket on fountain image. Spatial choreography clear despite group.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve/prove listening) tightens accumulatively via overlapping tales amid "distant horns... sirens"; agency in Elena's guiding "Continue" forecloses silence with relational cost in softened feuds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening mending silence emerges via clue-tales to healed tears; final "locket... swung from the fountain chain" reweights divides non-literally. No overt moralizing until subtle communal reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable Elena-limited POV with perceptual signature on objects/stories ("fingers traced the locket"); dialogue distinct (Ruiz gravelly, Liang cadence) pursues clues with subtext. Rhythmic modulation under intrusion stress coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in finale ("stories healed... bonds reform... mended", "softened gaze") and repetitive "stories" churn dull mailbox climax; metaphor density overwrites without payoff. Otherwise dense propulsion, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift locket igniting communal storytelling to unlock literal/metaphoric mailbox; transforms mystery trope via healing proof, inevitable in hindsight from clue accumulation.</comment>
