<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kai's motivation burns clearly and drives his entry and practice, earning his forged readiness; Elara's balanced curiosity appraises the relic and tempers instruction effectively. Lacks dramatized contradictory impulses in the demo peak, with interiority sparse beyond "heart pounding."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oriented cleanly in first paragraph; causal flow from relic presentation through holographic expansion to virtual rift and departure holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in Kai's nod and Elara's shadowed gaze, with conceptual cost of soul-contraction legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent vents, pressure seals, and phosphorescent fish integrate tactilely into action; chain link and orb constrain demo choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's precision amid benthic gloom, mirroring somber expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mastering starlight nav signaled early; holographic expansion tightens via exponential angles under Accumulative lens. Minimal opposition or reversal—smooth tutorial lacks live option foreclosure, keeping pressure abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Somber marvel emerges organically from relic grit, rift veils, and soul-contraction shadow, reweighting freedom as cosmic solitude. Final chain-as-talisman image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward starfields and edges; voice modulates rhythmically with ethereal blue holograms. Dialogue advances goal with subtext in Elara's murmurs, distinct from Kai's steady plea.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in demo with varied syntax accelerating expansion; rhythm breathes with scene. "Somber marvel" motif repeats purposefully but borders loop in late beats; minor figurative muddle like "voice a somber hymn" dulls peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pre-cataclysm chain unlocking alien edge geometry transforms deep-sea tropes into fresh multidimensional navigation. Risky crystalline entities and rift veils synthesize organically, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
