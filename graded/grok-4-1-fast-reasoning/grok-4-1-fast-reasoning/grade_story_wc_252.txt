<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and contradictory impulses in tavern confession ("ache for the sea's wild call" vs. tethered life), earning the final reveal; relationship as crucible forces mutual unlocking via scrimshaw. Minor slip in archetypal dock worker traits shown more via summary than micro-choices early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds (scrimshaw find → confession → whale call → island → detach), with on-page DC closure in rope-cutting and merfolk reveal; felt cost legible in "shedding the human pretense." Orientation anchored early in docks/fringe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (bioluminescent waves, salt-crusted crates) filter through Elara's priorities, constraining choices (moored skiff, wet sand); scrimshaw as micro-setting charges final glow/mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom/true nature) signaled early, tightens causally via scrimshaw unlock and whale pressure, narrowing to detach agency with visible cost in rope-sawing urgency; one decisive escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unbound liberty emerges organically from confessions and reveal, resonant in final dive image reweighting human cage; subtext in combative banter avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Elara's grace amid "muck"); dialogue distinct/natural ("too graceful for this muck" vs. retorts), advancing plot/subtext. Rhythmic prose modulates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density ("hearts guarded tighter than barnacle-crusted hulls") in opener purposeful but risks overload before pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Cataclysm no-violence forcing "combative tenderness," merfolk reveal via scrimshaw/whale; risk-taking in tonal blend heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
