<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in marginal truths compels precise chalk glyphs under arcade awakening pressure; embodied sweat and racing heart show contradictory joy/defiance without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from draft to chalk encoding to scanning pause; Charged Poise closure in sealing/tucking letter makes cost of exposure legible before post chute.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavement constrains chalk micro-choices amid holographic vines and drones; golden rays charge defiant final rise/heart etching as nostalgic micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant analog-secrecy stake signaled early deepens via glyph precision ("one wrong curve...dooms"); arcade stir and tails scan force tactical scan with legible exposure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margins theme emerges organically from chalk swirls to letter flourishes; final "truths would fly free...untouched by the digital storm" reweights low-tech rebellion without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with nostalgic perceptual signature (analog relics vs. futurism); diction/rhythm tense in "sweat beaded...scanning for tails" without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative stacks ("holographic vines...forgotten holograms") slightly muddle chalk peak; varied rhythm and clean syntax preserve closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sidewalk chalk ciphers in surveillance arcade synthesize fresh low-tech evasion; risk of enforcers heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
