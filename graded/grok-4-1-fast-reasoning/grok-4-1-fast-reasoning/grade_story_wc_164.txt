<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover vanished paths drives consistent micro-choices like pacing and tracing seeds, embodied in "cheerful gloom" and sea-foam aura; contradictory impulses in bittersweet vow yield earned acceptance of her own lost path. Internal conflict layers joy over sorrow without tidy resolution. Final change credible via prior conjecture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dim glass to seed-nestled patterns culminating in CR ("paths disappear... because they are seeds themselves") with conceptual cost of surrendered conjecture in final seed-tuck. Orientation anchored early in geode cave. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iridescent geode facets and quartz ledge constrain action, mirroring Elara's gloom-to-bright shift; seeds patter on glass charges revelation image. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (shimmering skin, echoing trill). Micro-setting (crater glass) pivotal in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, tightens via bird-seed deepening under accumulative lens, narrowing to realization with felt cost of personal loss. Agency in kneeling/tracing forecloses conjecture path. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of paths-as-seeds emerges organically from glass fissures and seed tendrils scripting "choice"/"untaken," reweighting premise in resonant final image without moralizing. Subtext in cheerful gloom invites ambiguity on surrender's joy. Closure reconfigures prior missing pieces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via frothy skin and dirge-humming; rhythmic modulation peaks in "waves clapping in joy over submerged wrecks." Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "frozen fireworks" purposeful in pattern, but minor overwriting in revelation beat ("azure curls, golden spirals") risks muddle without payoff. Rhythm varies, no loops; propulsion strong to closure. Minor figurative density slips non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist, emotion-transliterating glass, and seed-paths transforms metaphor into causal revelation; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight in bird's unwitting gift.</comment>
