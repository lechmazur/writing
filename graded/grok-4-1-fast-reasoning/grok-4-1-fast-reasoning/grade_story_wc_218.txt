<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's gently systematic trait and brazen calm drive micro-choices like gentle wire wrapping without scarring, embodied against weakening body and pain clawing his gut. Internal endurance shown in continued work despite breaths shallowing, with final laugh softly amid visions earning closure change. Minor idealization flattens contradiction slightly, but doesn't touch pivotal awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wiring density builds to canopy lattice, tremor awakening as cadence shift (DC/CR), with cost in "body stilling under starlit pillars." Orientation anchored early (Elias in temple orchard post-diagnosis). Single extended scene fits defaults; diary prophecies pay off visions without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via sturdiest oaks selected for wiring, quartz veins pulsing to spark arcs, charging final "glowing lattice" image. Sensory hierarchy botanical (sap flows, root architectures), evolves causally (pillars hum warmer). Micro-setting (copper coils) mirrors internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel orchard for interspecies respect pre-death) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via weakening body forcing endurance yet canopy completion narrows to final wrap. Agency in systematic loops despite pain; cost legible in "pain clawed his gut" persisting to awakening. No reversal overload needed; coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies harmony emerges via wiring union, visions of "forgotten pacts," reweighted in final pilgrim touch without moralizing. Returning helix pattern shifts from rift to alliance. Resonance in "Elias's spirit lingered in the hum," tying arc to question of unity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (botanical parsing: "waves whispering secrets only he could parse"). Lyrical rhythm modulates (short sentences at tremor: "Not quake, but awakening"). Minimal dialogue natural, murmured to oaks advances motivation. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "copper wire wrapped... leaves trembling" advances action, sensory, stakes). Rhythmic variety supports build to tremor. Minor loops in "brazen calm" phrasing purposeful pattern, not scaffold; figurative coherent (helix mirroring pillars). Slight overwriting density in early metaphors doesn't dull closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: copper-oak-stone conduit awakens sentience, transforming plundering trope via diary blueprint. Bold risk in fantasy orchard harmony feels inevitable from systematic wiring. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity to interspecies pact payoff heightens stakes.</comment>
