<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Traits like "shrewd" and "whimsically attentive" are labeled repetitively without deep contradictory impulses acting in pivotal revelation scene; motivation clear but lacks embodied flaws complicating the bond-forming choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via envelope mix-up → cottage visit → mutual revelation → weekly meetings → new locket RR (Charged Poise in shared photo); one tightening at Mira's backstory disclosure makes before/after legible with relational cost of opening reclusive lives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Breezy library swaying like cargo nets and starry pier integrate selectively via Elias's perceptual bias, subtly guiding tracking choice and charging final photo image; sensory balance vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplift silent contributors via mystery) signaled early, tightens causally at locket backstory reveal narrowing isolation options; low-key pressure coheres but lacks visceral trade-off beyond mild emotional blooming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from locket engraving → mirrored kindness reveal → new photo reprise reweighting hidden giving without moralizing; resonant counter-reading in unseen tides lingers via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with whimsical perceptual signature (dockside metaphors); dialogue natural/subtext-driven in Mira's hesitant reveal, distinct idiom; minor repetition erodes rhythm under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("cautious exuberance" x3, "whimsically attentive" x2, "shrewd" variants) and template cadence (e.g., "Elias [trait verb]") across beats dull propulsion; figurative density overwrites revelation without payoff, obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mistaken locket trope transformed seaside via cargo broker observation, but premise hedges in tidy symmetry without bold risk; fresh inflections in library "mistake shelves" add mild ingenuity.</comment>
