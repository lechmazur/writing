<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to pierce buried truths intensifies compellingly through trembling fingers slotting the key and raw-fingered compliance in the parley. Contradictory impulses act in the dual-timeline heart race, earning the hardened resolve without unearned epiphanies. Minor stock phrasing like "solemn resolve hardened" slightly dilutes particularity but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visionary density reconfigures truths, with CR closure in glowing sigils matching debris oaths and "purpose-laden dunes." Cost legible in "eternal entrapment" risk and reforming sands release. Two-shard structure (library to lagoon/back) transitions legibly; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dunes parting "like reluctant flesh," obsidian lagoon's "inky expanse," and debris relics constrain parley choices vividly. Sensory hierarchy (scorching sun on neck, volcanic glass) reflects archivist urgency; final zeppelin shadow charges CR image. Setting evolves causally from library sway to sealing sands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover purge truths) signaled early, tightens via guardians' "Prove lineage" demand forcing oath sigil. Density escalates in dancing debris visions of "hordes herded into pits"; agency in debris arrangements forecloses entrapment with raw-finger cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "tension births truth" emerges organically from debris parley and visions, resonant in final "archives unbound" without moralizing. Matriarch's shells spelling betrayers reweights civil-rights premise via particulars. Complexity lingers in unresolved grievances' mist approval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in reverie-tinged noticing (e.g., "letters pulsing with newfound clarity"). Rhythmic texture modulates from gentle sway to vertigo seize; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in liminal voices dissolving. Elevated diction consistent for archivist voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "fingers trembled as he slotted brass key," but overwriting figurative clusters ("tension coiling like heat haze," "sands parted like reluctant flesh") muddle peak parley clarity slightly. Minor "tension" repetition; rhythm varies read-aloud. No loops dull closure sigils image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Debris-message parley in obsidian lagoon transforms uprising trope via retrocognitive sigils and zeppelin shadow. Fresh synthesis of civil-rights archive with dune guardians feels inevitable; risk-taking in non-verbal communication heightens stakes organically.</comment>
