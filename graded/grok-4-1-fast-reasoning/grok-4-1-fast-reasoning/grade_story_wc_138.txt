<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied shifts like "heart stirring after eons" and "electric hunger," with motivation intensifying to compel the nexus positioning; final renunciation of stasis earned through causal buildup from boredom to embrace, foreclosing immortality's tedium with felt cost in unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from amulet touch to dimensional clash; on-page CR closure in "eternity fragmented—not ended, but reborn" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of stasis shattered, constraint of fragment persisting through tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "ozone and possibility" and crystal lattices humming constrain choices via flux lines and nexus spire; prismatic hues evolve causally to "monochrome voids," charging final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boredom vs. novelty) signaled early tightens accumulatively to ignition at nexus, narrowing options via manipulated fields; agency in "channeling the fragment's curse" drives escalation, cost legible in essence pulled by "inexorable hunger."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "after goodbye" emerges organically from flashes of past endings to final "thunder hushed into symphonies of beginning," resonant CR reweighting without moralizing; ambiguity in rebirth lingers via fractured realms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in prismatic biases like "folds where others glimpsed flatness"; rhythmic modulation peaks in "laughed softly into the chaos," diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motifs like "hushed thunder" varying rhythm; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors during climax ("folds and tears," "hues bleeding") coheres via pattern but slightly muddles peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality ennui with spatial mutiny via magnetic conduits transforms tropes; risk in lyric unraveling heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from fragment's curse to reborn eternity.</comment>
