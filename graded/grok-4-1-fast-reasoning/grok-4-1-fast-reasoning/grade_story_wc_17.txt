<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in echoes speaking in sleep compels return despite prior dismissal of madness, with embodied reactions like trembling fingers under pressure. Final transmutation to duty earned via causal discoveries. Minor stock phrasing ("heart pounding") slightly dilutes interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries link via sensory cues to chamber vision as CR closure, with cost in "legacy's burden crashed over Elias like a collapsing vault." Orientation anchored early (who/where/when by para 2). One tightening via echoes developing the strip suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy constrains movement ("thorns snagging... grip tightening") and charges climax ("vines slithered... reclaiming its own"). Sensory hierarchy via cartographer bias privileges sound (echoes humming, screaming) amid vivid post-climate verdancy. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks through passage to alcove to darkroom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover walls' dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to betrayal glimpse narrowing innocence option. Agency in murmuring to echoes forces revelation with conceptual cost transmuted to duty. Climax pressure coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ancestral betrayal vs. confession emerges via particulars (diaries, seismic vision), reweighted in final sketching atonement image without moralizing. Final line ("under a sky bruised perpetual green, he began sketching—not corridors, but atonement") offers resonant CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in echo-attuned noticing ("whispers of sound rebounding," "walls dreaming louder"). Prose rhythm modulates tension, diction purposeful (e.g., "pulsed like veins"). No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm propels via varied syntax. Minor deduction for "ivy-veiled passage" repetition (5x, borders loop without full payoff) and occasional overwriting ("emerald tendrils that pulsed like veins in the humid air"). Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo cartography mapping seismic sins in vine-ruined world, with surreal walls-dreaming payoff inevitable from setup. Risky conceptual CR heightens stakes via nature's judgment without gimmick.</comment>
