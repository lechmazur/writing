<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthesia embodied as "colors exploded into sounds" drives micro-choices like kneeling and singing; internal conflict in despair vs. echoed triumphs compels earned change with visible cost in career mend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of echoes tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "despair cracked like old scenery" and lingering whisper, reconfiguring timelines on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mystic orchard's fruits "pulsing in rhythm" and maze paths constrain discovery of stage/coin, charging singing climax and final image; synesthetic sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of despair-to-possibility signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening echoes that force singing agency; cost unmistakable in cracked despair and ongoing spectral lure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia luring possibility emerges organically from coin/echoes; final "coin... hearing Reginald's laugh" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("scents blending into symphonies of crimson") distinct and biased; stable limited POV modulates rhythmically under pressure, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stacked synesthetic metaphors in singing beat ("orchestral rainbows") slightly over-dense, dulling propulsion; zero loops, high density elsewhere with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia fracturing timelines into vaudevillian orchard echoes transforms ghost trope organically; bold perceptual risk heightens closure stakes inevitably.</comment>
