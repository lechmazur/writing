<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's reticence compellingly fractures in the testimony beat ("I testify," weathered voice cracking), earning a meaningful change with embodied tears and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via crystal taps building echo density to CR closure (legacy embedded eternally), with legible cost in halted growth and deepening hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shadowed library's hush and dawn rays constrain sonic defiance, while crystal as micro-setting charges the lectern placement and final wink.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to decode growth tightens via accelerating sequences (baby babble to memes), forcing agency in testimony under coherent hush pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fractal language tree emerges organically from echoes, offering resonant CR to growth's halt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct sonic/reflective perceptual signature persists, but elevated diction occasionally jars the reticent POV's simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting and loops ("fractured sequences" x5+, "suspended hush" variations) with final third's repetitive fragments ("Crystal waited... Dawn repeated") dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sonic crystal as language archive oracle offers fresh fractal growth synthesis, transforming lexical stasis ingeniously.</comment>
