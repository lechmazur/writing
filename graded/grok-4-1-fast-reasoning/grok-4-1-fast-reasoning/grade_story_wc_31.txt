<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in Lira's riddle compels higher-stakes choices like wading into the tide; interiority concrete via key tag and vows. Minor slip: minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though endurance earns reunion cost. Spectral librarian applies relevant pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying lantern light and hush density to CR closure: Lira's transformation revealed with year-long grief cost legible in "she had become the library's echo." Orientation anchored early in pier/lantern rite; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Receded tide constrains ship access, bioluminescent shelves supply revelation resource, lanterns charge final release image. Sensory hierarchy lamplighter-specific (light ripples, glowing key); details evolve causally with entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Lira via sound's color) signaled early, deepens texturally through ship entry and librarian revelation narrowing to synesthetic truth. Agency in purposeful wade/press key forecloses loss path; cost felt in transformation permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic vows theme emerges via particular images (glowing script, prismatic swirl), final lantern release reconfigures loss into binding light without moralizing. Resonance from Elias's arc inextricable from vow pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/hush noticing; lyrical rhythm modulates intensity. Librarian dialogue natural/subtextual, advances revelation cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful light metaphors; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor density slip in repeated "glowing/shimmering" cluster mid-ship entry, but coherent and pattern-taught without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia quest in vow-library transforms loss trope via light/sound fusion; bold textural risks heighten mystical stakes organically to charged CR image.</comment>
