<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong reflective traits shown through peripheral focus and micro-choices like sketching angles, compelling the climactic calibration; interiority concrete via embodied observation without stock phrasing. Final endurance of isolation mirrors motivation with felt cost in self-echo harvest. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of echoes and angles builds to nexus convergence with legible before/after in timer's full seizure and tested replay. Orientation anchored early (Elias in marble cavern, wounded season). Closure as Charged Poise in ascent with stored wonder, cost in isolation's manifold reflection undeniable on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble cavern's veined walls and light fissures constrain choices via reflection angles, charging final image of whispering farewell. Sensory hierarchy (sound amplification, peripheral light bends) POV-specific to locksmith's trade. Purposeful details evolve causally with time/shadows, mirroring internal harvest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest echoes via timer) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through angle tightenings yielding clicks to full whir. Agency in persistent calibration forces trade-off (central muddies, peripheral reveals). Cost legible in partial harvest's volatility resolved at nexus with isolation deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of storing wonder against forgetfulness emerges organically from echo layering and self-reflection harvest, final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in reason's volatile cellar invites ambiguity on isolation's price. Resonant non-literal answer in "keys to memory's vault."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with peripheral perceptual signature biasing notice of edges/angles; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm with time shifts. No dialogue. Diction reflects reflective mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/image; purposeful metaphors (echo sheafs, light betrayal) pattern-taught without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "echoes harvested" and repetitive "peripherally" dull propulsion slightly (−0.4), but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith trade with echo-harvest via angular acoustics transforms trope of relic-repair into memory-vault premise. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via cavern's logic. No close echoes of templates.</comment>
