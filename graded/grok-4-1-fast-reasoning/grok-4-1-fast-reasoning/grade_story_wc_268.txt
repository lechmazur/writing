<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Diminutive titan trait motivates sly method but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating choices; steady competence without visible struggle flattens interior depth, as in untroubled inscription scenes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with message density building to CR closure (pretender's cascade of truths with empire's conceptual cost legible in final image); mosaic shards of plantings taught early via time-pause motif, one tightening at final missive to pretender's hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's temporal snare and infinite shelves constrain choices (messages over direct action), eternal font enables ink; recurring constellations charge final image of resuming dance, mirroring verity's triumph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates via accumulating whispers fraying alliances under Accumulative lens to climax tightening; pretender's downfall bears visible cost (graceful collapse), though Lirion pays none on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth's quiet triumph over artifice emerges organically from message drift and final silken ruin; resonant non-literal answer in thrones toppling elegantly reweights falsehood's fragility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with cosmic perceptual signature (e.g., stars wheeling in languid hesitation); voice texture consistent and rhythmic but elevated diction borders overwrought in pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades high-pressure beats (e.g., ink "blooming rusty-black, perfect for runes") without selective sparsity, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "graceful collapse" and "drifted" accumulate in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tiny titan librarian weaponizing drifting tomes transforms guardian trope; risky lyrical mosaic heightens cosmic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rune mechanics.</comment>
