<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation burns clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like yanking cords and intensifying tempo; contradictory "mournfully eager" impulses embody in pulsing form and glistening eyes during the chuckle. Interiority concrete via gaze on spectral figures. Minor archetype lean in spectral household but earned change at sputter forecloses path with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rustle prelude to thundering polyphony, tightening via reserve blower surge to peak laughter. On-page RR closure ("blowers sputtered... figures faded into contentment") lands Charged Poise with time's absolute cost legible in final hush. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel constrains via resonant walls etching griefs, amplifying winds/lullabies to macerate; bioluminescent glow and spectral table charge actions. Final silence recharges setting's hush. Sensory hierarchy (auditory dominance) fits urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered blowers, spectral stirring, to laughter cascade under time pressure. Agency in conducting forecloses via sputter; felt cost in fading echoes undeniable. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of confronting unspoken via absurd tending emerges organically; final balm image answers restoration question non-literally, reweighting griefs to joy with lingering ambiguity of silence. No moralizing; subtext in loosening jaws, blooming "I love yous."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (phantom yanks, reedy falsetto); lyrical texture modulates rhythmically with intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful repetition ("mournfully eager") voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (prelude rustles to thundering roars); high density in "winds weaving a cacophony that battered the stone." Patterned "mournfully eager" repetition taught early, serves voice without loop penalty; minor figurative density in peak but coherent, no muddle at closure sputter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Leaf-blower orchestra transforms ghost-tending trope via specific maceration mechanics and half-sung winds; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risky whimsy heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
