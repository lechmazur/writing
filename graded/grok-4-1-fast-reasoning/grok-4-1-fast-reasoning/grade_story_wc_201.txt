<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Proprioceptively embodied trauma responses reveal contradictory impulses of agony-as-compass, earning the final memory crystallization; interiority particular without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as trauma spasms layer density to CR closure at "mercy's math was the limit... her displaced body the proof," with cost in "heart stuttering its rhythm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV forest's "branch angles mirroring neural fractals" constrains braces and charges final "violet light softening," per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of mercy's math tightens accumulatively via deepening spasms (e.g., "legs buckled proprioceptively"), forcing endurance with costs like "knuckles hyper-extended."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pain-to-mercy integration emerges via forest-body mirroring, resonating non-literally in "rooted yet free" rise; inquisitor quote borders echo but dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Proprioceptive perceptual signature ("mapping the bark's ridges... like a lover's scars") biases noticing distinctly, rhythmic under spasms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dense UV-math metaphors cohere propulsively; "brace" patterning purposeful, but opening metaphor stack ("receding tide... invisible fire") borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>UV penance as fractal mercy math synthesizes torture/origins ingeniously, transforming survivor trope via proprioceptive forest computation.</comment>
