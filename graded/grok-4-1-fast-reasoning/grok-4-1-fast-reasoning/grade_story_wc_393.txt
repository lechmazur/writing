<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's embodied guilt peaks in throat-tight confession and tear-welling realization; contradictory impulses (past judgment vs. redemptive action) act simultaneously during repair watch, earning final vow with visible cost of foreclosed inaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from arrival to storm-light trigger; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "Marcus had deserved that second opinion in life, not just in death's echo," reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workbench and beam "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" constrain repair choice and charge final pulsing image; sensory details (gear whir, rain lashing) mirror internal tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem via repair) signaled early tightens texturally via storm escalation to light-deepening; agency in bringing/watching forecloses judgmental path with guilt-cost crystallized in vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of second chances emerges organically from heart's revival answering Marcus's plea; final image reweights without moralizing, though Harrow's "soul of repair" line borders directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of chaplain's regret filters setting; dialogue subtextual (Harrow's "Deserve? That's for clocks and men alike") advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("vibrant hush," "aptly deliberate" x3 each) taught early but risks loop in mid-repair, dulling propulsion slightly; rhythm varies well overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clockwork heart etched with Bible verses transforms redemption trope into mechanical soul-mending; storm-light miracle risks lyric boldness, heightening stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
