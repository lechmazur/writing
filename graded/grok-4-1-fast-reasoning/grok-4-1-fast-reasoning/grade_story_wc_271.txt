<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's interiority shines in the freeze's embodied contradiction, pulses and seizing muscles revealing trauma-rooted impulses; change to sharing photo is earned via prior grafting talent paralleling adaptation. Minor therapy-speak ("somatic markers") feels diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure. Blind spots in grief enable outreach to artist, complicating solo endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo cue anchors trauma pattern early, density builds to freeze's pattern break, resolving in Charged Poise (pearl of stillness) with endurance cost legible in thawing limbs and shared photo. Orientation clear by para 2 (Elena, arboretum, post-wedding trauma). Single scene coheres without shards; closure reconfigures survival premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum constrains via wind-whine triggering freeze, charging final image of lighthouse beam and fireflies. Sensory hierarchy (salt spray narrowing vision) reflects trauma urgency; recurring ferns/hybrid roses mirror adaptation without overt symbol. Spatial choreography tracks kneel-to-rise fluidly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trauma freeze vs. adaptation) signaled in grafting intro, tightens accumulatively in somatic whine-to-freeze deepening knowledge of markers as guides. Freeze forecloses denial path with felt somatic cost; artist interaction crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of realism-anchored optimism emerges from particulars (grafting scars, plant bending), reweighted in pearl image without statement; final sharing offers non-literal answer to trauma's recurrence. Subtext in photo's shift from wound to endurance carries ambiguity of grief's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with Elena's perceptual bias (pulses in leaves, somatic gut-spine); voice lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in freeze compression. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, artist's hesitation echoing Elena's without convergence. No head-hopping; diction fits callused hands' lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short freeze sentences propel, longer reflections breathe); density high, images like "fog horns in the wind" advance atmosphere. Minor metaphor density in opening ("fragile Eden") risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays in plant motifs; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drone strike survivor grafted to botanical adaptation yields fresh trauma lens, transforming tropes via somatic/plant parallels; risk in quiet stasis heightens stakes. Photo reprise recharges backstory organically, avoiding template recovery arcs.</comment>
