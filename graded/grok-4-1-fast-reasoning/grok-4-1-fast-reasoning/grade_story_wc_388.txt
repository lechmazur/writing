<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pivotal hesitation after unearthing the diamond—"For the first time, he questioned his crusade"—earns the renunciation, embodying contradiction between unyielding quest and survival wisdom with visible cost to identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly from letter reassembly to floorboard discovery, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing at reburial where "Some truths were too fragile for the wasteland's winds" makes conceptual cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard's "perfect circular boundary: chaos outside, serenity within" constrains entry/exit choices and charges final image as "stillpoint's calm lingered... faded behind him."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of thriving orchard and pondering debunker offers resonant non-literal answer to truth-vs-lies question, reweighting premise without moralizing as "survival sometimes demanded comfortable lies."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc debunker arc transformed by flawed-diamond tech reveal leading to self-repricing; risk of quiet stasis heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
