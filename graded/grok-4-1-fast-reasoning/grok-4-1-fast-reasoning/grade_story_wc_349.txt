<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's vendor mask cracks amid quantifying personal voids, revealing contradictory curation of memories as both deliberate and chaining; incisions force micro-choices that earn descent, foreclosing looped life with integrated cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via quantified tallies to "core glyph" incision; slate's prismatic bloom delivers CR, repricing absence as origin with vendor dissolution as conceptual cost in final descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard and cloud sea mirror fragmentation, creaking and parting to constrain/urge ritual completion; vortex glimpse charges closure image of clouds engulfing Elias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to achieve parole tightens accumulatively through deepening incisions ("slate warmed... flared"); core cut narrows to self-scatter, with legible cost in forsaking shop for vortex.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final prismatic map and "absence's cradle" reweight voids as story origin non-literally; fragmentation-to-unity emerges organically from ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of quantified scatter ("memories placed like deliberate debris"); rhythmic syntax modulates ritual intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via incision progression; minor figurative pileup in "moonlight flared, scattering motes like mindful confetti" coherent but dense, not obscuring closure bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence" freshly transforms clean slate into parole ritual; descent into cloud nexus inevitable from particulars, risking bold lyric synthesis.</comment>
