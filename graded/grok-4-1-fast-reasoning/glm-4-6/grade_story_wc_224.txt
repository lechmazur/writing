<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied pain ("chest tightening") root motivation in suppressed talents stirring under memory pressure; micro-choices like seeking the stone and experimenting earn the final realization. Minor slip in epiphany tidiness at "home was not a place... but a talent," bordering on unearned without more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from stone discovery to seeded reality; closure as CR lands on-page with legible cost in "might not need to return to this world at all," reweighting options. Orientation anchored early (mirror, vaults, spire); single tightening via successful seeding suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mercury-glass mirror, stone, and feather as micro-settings constrain choices (conduit via texture) and charge final image (hand on mirror). Vivid, selective sensory integration (metallic scent, velvet shadows, feather nerves) reflects POV urgency without catalog; bookstore rearranges purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recreate home) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through painful memories → stone power → feather conduit → stable reality narrowing to transformation risk. Agency in nightly substitutions and seeding shows trade-offs; cost felt in "dangerous habit" and "hidden thunder" warning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of home as seedable internal state emerges organically from particulars (stone map to "state of being"); final image resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in controlled visions vs. buried power avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (rippling silver, shifting symbols); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to charged ("thunder within preparing for release"). Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; minor paraphrase loops ("buried talents" recurrence) but patterned, not obscuring cause/effect. Figurative coherence (ripples like water, hope delicate as feather) supports tone without muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer seeding realities via obsidian stone/feather in responsive bookstore transforms fantasy tropes; final CR inevitable from established pattern. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
