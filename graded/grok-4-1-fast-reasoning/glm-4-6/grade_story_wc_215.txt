<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong particularity in Elisha's perceptual mediation during the ritual gasp and furrowed concentration, revealing hierarchy of values in preserving silence; minor flaw in label-speak ("tranquilly perceptive nature") without simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (shifting colors → bee swarms → intention ritual) tightens to Charged Poise closure in harmonious patterns and new ghosts; on-page cost legible in "astonished gasp" and effortful mediation, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (vibrations under skin, temperature shifts, blood-and-ash dusk) mirrors internal states and constrains oasis boundary choices; recurring box and hives charge final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fracturing covenant) signaled early via box patterns, escalates accumulatively through ritual deepening that forecloses discord with agency in intention-speaking; cost felt in concentration and outsider pressures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken eloquence emerges organically from pattern communication and ritual silence, reweighted in final image of pulsing box and new ghosts without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to chaos vs. equilibrium.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in clue-pattern noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but "contextual clues" paraphrase loop (thrice, including ritual beat) dulls peak propulsion by −0.5; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc ghosts, bee hive-mind, and glass covenant transforms tropes through textured perception; risk in mute ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via oasis equilibrium.</comment>
