<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness roots motivation effectively, enabling deeper sensory connection shown in "without words, he could hear the music," but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied internal conflict; micro-choices like adjusting the lever align with traits yet feel harmonious without struggle, limiting depth for single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from positioning to melting; clear orientation by first paragraph anchors tuner on bluff; closure as Charged Poise in iceberg's vibration-induced melt reconfigures preservation stake with conceptual cost of ice's release, legible in "its truth being released drop by drop."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bluff, sculptures, and iceberg constrain choices (e.g., fragment alignment with pendulums) and charge final image; sensory details like "hum... felt in the bones" and "scent of ozone and metal" integrate purposefully through POV bias, mirroring mute harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder signaled early tightens via vibration escalation narrowing ice's integrity; agency in adjustments drives deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost felt in melting fragment foreclosing its static form, though pressure remains subtle without opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silent truth-preservation emerges organically from mute actions and melting ice releasing "color of wonder," resonant in final sky hues without moralizing; subtext in motion-over-words avoids platitudes, reweighting silence as vigor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in kinetic sensations (e.g., "fingers danced," "hands still moving"); lyrical rhythm modulates effectively for textural build, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops like "glisten-ing" (6+ instances) and "symphonies of truth" (4x) create paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion in descriptive runs; overwriting in peak melt beat with stacked metaphors (e.g., "prism of light... language of wonder") obscures clarity; rhythm varies but template cadence in adjustments drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, sky-iceberg, and kinetic truth-symphonies transforms tropes into cohesive vision; risk in muted lyricism heightens stakes of wonder's fragility, inevitable in melting payoff.</comment>
