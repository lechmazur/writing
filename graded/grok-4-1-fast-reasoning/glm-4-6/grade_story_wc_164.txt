<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in quest for disappearing paths, with embodied emotion in glass warmth and seed handling; micro-choices like arranging voids reveal values. Mild internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance of bittersweet quest earns closure. Final scribbling and storing glass show credible change without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed processing builds density to pattern break with voids, yielding CR closure via image of figure planting seeds—cost in raised questions felt in "more complete story." Orientation anchored early (Aelia in geode, migration day). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Geode cave iridescent details (rainbows, crystalline floor, light shifts) constrain positioning and time pressure, charging final light entry; sensory hierarchy via Aelia's professional eye (seeds as stars). Mirrors internal cheerful gloom purposefully. Environment shapes seed collection and charges ending whisper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via void seeds narrowing to vibration/images; agency in feverish arranging forecloses ignorance with bittersweet cost. Time pressure (sun zenith) alters tactics. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate memory voids emerges organically from color patterns to CR realization, reweighting preservation as diseased harvest; final image of stored glass offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in cheerful gloom avoids moralizing. Particulars like empty circles drive ambiguity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (emotions as colors, seeds as stars); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating with intensity (feverish scribbling). No head-hopping or elision; diction fits fantasy idiom. Rhythmic control heightens realization without artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere (e.g., "red bloomed like blood"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds—motif "cheerful gloom" purposeful. Propulsion clear in seed-by-seed build to vibration. Zero figurative muddle in peak; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-harvesting via bird seeds and crater glass transforms fantasy tropes through lived detail and CR of deliberate voids. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from particulars like emotion colors to empty circles.</comment>
