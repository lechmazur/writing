<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush prophecy is clear but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied flaws; abstract interiority like "tranquil blaze" dominates without micro-choices under pressure revealing character limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of silence imagery to Resonant Reconfiguration closure (crane to absorbing sphere/disk hushes prophecy); cost legible in tucked remnant and bled hush into brook; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook as micro-setting evolves (pauses, resumes softer) mirroring internal hush and constraining ritual choice; sensory hush/noise selective, charges final image of tamed murmur.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) tightens texturally via intensifying focus and crane transformation narrowing to contained success; agency in willed flow shows one deepening with felt containment cost, but opposition feels abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of intentional silence as peace emerges organically from hush-mapping and prophecy undoing; final walking silhouette reweights prior tension without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with silence-biased perception; rhythmic modulation supports build, but repetitive diction slightly erodes distinction under peak transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("silence/hush/smoothed hush" churn across beats) and repeated motifs ("tranquil blaze" x4) dull propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures closure image, with mixed metaphors straining coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh origami ritual out-silencing prophecy transforms summoning trope via textual hush density; bold lyrical synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
