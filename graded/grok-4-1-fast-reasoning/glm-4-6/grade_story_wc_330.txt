<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's persistent traits and embodied silence drive discovery and culminate in earned singing choice; contradictory endurance of muteness breaks authentically at halo touch without epiphany labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as silence motifs densify to halo discovery and voice DC; closure reconfiguration legible in "began to sing" with emotional cost of reclaimed self, orientation anchored early in train salvage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Train cars, weathered wood, and crystalline case constrain wrong-turn discovery and charge singing image; sensory hush and gleam filter through carpenter's tactile priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-as-possibility deepens accumulatively via halo pulse narrowing mute endurance; agency in reaching/singing forecloses silence with felt cost in "raw and authentic" emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silence-to-voice theme emerges organically from particulars, final harmonized song reconfiguring decay motif without moral; resonant ambiguity in "seed of possibility" lingers post-closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with carpenter-specific perceptual signature in wood grooves and gleams; lyrical rhythm swells from hush to song cadence, compression taught early and legible at vocal peak.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax matching hush-to-song arc; minor figurative stacking at "language of light and shadow" slightly blurs halo inscription without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Halo-in-circus synthesis transforms abandonment tropes via carpenter's voice reclamation; fresh persistent-silent arc risks lyric quietude heightening stakes to authentic payoff.</comment>
