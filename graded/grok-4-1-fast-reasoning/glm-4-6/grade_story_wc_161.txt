<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's death intensely compels the attachment and release, with trembling hands embodying contradiction; change to trust feels earned via fragile plan. Minor slip: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak embodiment during bird operation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust patterns and bird integration build to Charged Poise closure in release, with conceptual cost of madness-edged hope legible in "paper-thin hope balanced on the edge of madness." Orientation anchored early; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skylight and dust motes as micro-setting constrain method and charge final image of resumed spiral post-release. Sensory details (decaying paper, metallic coolness) selectively mirror isolation and preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving echo escalates via skittish bird and delicate attachment under Accumulative lens, narrowing to release with felt fragility cost; agency in tweezers operation forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fleeting trails and preservation emerges organically via dust, meteorite, bird flight; final "tender bloom of trust" reweights loss without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "dust motes...fluttering note in a silent symphony"; rhythmic lyricism modulates to quiet intensity at launch, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-packed lines; purposeful "blooming, withering" refrain avoids loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("wildfire flowers...tiny, withering star") during setup slightly dulls early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon courier, meteorite vessel, dust-mapping transforms preservation trope; risk in fragile plan heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via trails motif.</comment>
