<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in aeons of boredom intensifies to compel the final letting go with unmaking cost; interiority concrete in shard's thrum and dead heart match. Minor slip in alternating summary ("curse... repetition") rather than simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm-amulet pulses build density to origami collapse CR with dissolution cost legible in "felt himself dissolve... unspooled." Single continuous scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in escondite and storm. Gate caps at 8.7 due to Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains steps ("careful negotiation of shifting light-prisms") and charges final scar image; storm sensory details selective via POV urgency. Gate caps at 8.7.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer after goodbye via mutiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to chamber press narrowing options; agency and unmaking cost unmistakable. One tightening sufficient; gate caps higher potential at 8.7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of finality emerges organically from unmaking into "nothing, and everything"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing. Minor explicit "paradox was complete" edges toward telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture and stable single POV with biased noticing (dimensional screams); rhythm modulates to climax compression. Capped at 7.6 per Q7 debt; minor repetition convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting with stacked metaphors ("painted the void in strokes of hushed thunder," "watercolors") muddles peak chamber beat; loops ("hushed thunder" x4, "goodbye" echoes, prismatic churn) dull closure image. Paraphrase redundancy in final paragraphs; −1.7 artifact pack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal boredom into physics-magic unmaking; spatial mutiny transforms trope organically. Gate caps at 8.7; bold premise commitment.</comment>
