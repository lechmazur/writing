<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via borrowed voices shifting organically ("crisp cadence of the philosophy professor"), with contradictory impulses between calculation and raw feeling culminating in earned change when personalities "peel away," revealing authentic self at "his own voice returned."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through halo visions and press activation to CR closure at "workshop's walls dissolved," where conceptual cost of individuality within collective is legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details like "fractured the golden workshop glow into impossible geometries" filter through Silas's mathematical gaze, with vanishing stars as recurring object constraining timing and charging final dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mathematizing emotion tightens accumulatively via halo pressing "against his temple" then "into his chest," forcing trade-off of borrowed selves for earned empathy, with cost felt in peeling personalities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion beyond calculation emerges implicitly through prints and visions, resonating in non-literal final print "cease calculating them" that reweights prior borrowed traits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors; purposeful voice modulation via borrowed cadences distinguishes internal shifts without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel towards closure, with metaphors like "peel away like old wallpaper" purposeful; minor overwriting in star repetitions taught as pattern without obscuring final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress as emotional calculus with celestial fragmentation transforms tropes of self-discovery; risk of collective ending heightens stakes, inevitable in halo's deliberate shattering.</comment>
