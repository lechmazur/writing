<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's steady fingers and recognition of masks versus essences reveal character under pressure, earning his final realization; Anna applies targeted exposition as secondary pressure. Internal unrest churns concretely but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knot-unraveling densifies silence releases toward CR closure: "grief, when properly honored, becomes connection rather than confinement," with conceptual cost in villagers' refusal. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism starlight constrains grounding—"luminous forms finding anchor in the very light"—and charges final image; tactile net, needle handling integrate selectively via Elias's restorer bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to whispers, hues under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free/ground spirits signaled early; accumulative escalation via intensifying silence—"weight of years pressing against Elias's ears"—tightens to final knot's memory release with agency-driven cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of revelation beneath surfaces emerges organically from masks/nets, culminating in non-literal CR repricing without moralizing. Spirits' anchoring reweights grief's binding via particulars, inviting ambiguity on collective fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV stable third-limited until intrusive first-person slip—"I saw them daily in my shop"—disrupts focalization; voice poetic with perceptual signature in fractured light, but elision untaught. Dialogue natural, goal-driven with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency; density high, metaphors coherent ("tapestry needle hummed"). Minor loops in "across sharing this secret" and "accumulated silence" drag slightly; proofreading slips like "respresenting" minor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Net-trapped spirits unraveled by mask restorer in prism sanctuary synthesizes fresh conceit; final hands-realization feels inevitable from established particulars, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
