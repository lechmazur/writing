<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in refusing erasure via drumming compels the surge of memories, with embodied tears and pulse merge showing contradiction between guinea pig burden and dream conduit; strong interiority peaks at "the guinea pig’s burden lifted." Minor slip in diagnostic labels like "rebellious streak flared" abstracts peak defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from drumming to garden bloom and dream solidification as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); orientation anchored early ("perched on the edge of the sound wave garden"); cost legible in "auroral sorrow lingered, a bittersweet undercurrent." One tightening via "memories surged" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains via responsive stalks and hum shaping drumming tactics; sensory hierarchy synesthetic (vibrations bending light) filters through Kael's urgency, charging final "waves bowing around him." Recurrent crystalline stalks mirror internal surge without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim dream vs. erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via quickening drum to "We’re running out of time" deepening knowledge/cost; agency in defiant drumming forecloses erasure path with tears as felt price at climax surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of heart's rebellion vs. control emerges via particulars like memory chorus and garden resonance, culminating in non-literal final image of "lagoon’s starlight lingering" reweighting sorrow/hope without moralizing; subtext in blurred faces implies shared loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound waves bending light into shimmering curtains") stable in close third; rhythmic modulation builds to closure exhale without head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits experimental aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrase loops ("auric lagoon under starlight" x6, "entangled memories" churn) and paraphrase redundancy (multiple "hum louder/surged" restatements) dull propulsion, especially in final third bloom; mixed metaphors like "waves lapping at him like the lagoon’s edge" strain amid density bloat. Template cadence in descriptive runs obscures peak surge clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-light garden, memory entanglement, and guinea pig rebellion transforms sci-fi tropes via tactile resonance; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at "garden burst into full bloom," inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
