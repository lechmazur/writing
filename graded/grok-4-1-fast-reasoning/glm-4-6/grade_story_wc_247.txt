<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Julian's motivation to resurrect forgotten voices intensifies through embodied actions like raising the empty camera and interlocking hands, earning the final vow; Lyra applies pressure as advisor via signing turns like "tide turns." Minor flaw: internal conflict leans poetic over sharply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising in gestures ("hands moved faster") to Charged Poise closure in final click and image of pockets "empty of film but full of songs," reweighting silence with conceptual cost of bittersweet memory; orientation anchored early in harbor/dock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous harbor moonlight vividly selective (ripples as "silver seams," lapping waves translated), mirroring internal states and constraining the performance stage; lighthouse silhouette charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to translate silence into music signaled early, tightens texturally via bolder gestures and "almost" to foreclose via completion with felt cost in tears and "sorrow of solitude"; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting forgotten via art emerges organically from sign/camera interplay, resonant CR in final image reweighting premise without moral; no tidy resolution, ambiguity in "world remembered, for a moment."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (framing light "to trap its light in a cage"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("listen to the silence"); rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with purposeful repetition (clicks as metronome) building texture, high density in integrated sensory images; deduct for minor figurative density ("thread of silk against the roar," "painted in hues of melancholy") bordering overwrite in peak gestures without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empty camera/sign language transforms silence-to-music trope via inherited talisman and gestural symphony; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, feels inevitable in "ghost" line.</comment>
