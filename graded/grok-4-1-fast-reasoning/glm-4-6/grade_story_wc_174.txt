<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's serenity and motivation root consistently in post-argument epiphany, driving micro-choices like puppet construction; internal conflict emerges through subversive reversals rather than alternation. Earned change in releasing puppets forecloses control with felt evolution cost. Minor abstraction in "half-lit epiphanies" leans toward summary over embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from epiphany to shows to final release; mosaic shards taught early ("Weeks passed") with legible transitions. Orientation anchors by para 2 (Elias, dome, post-argument). Closure as CR: puppets' strings cut reconfigures storytelling premise with conceptual cost of lost control, legible in "no longer bound to his narrative direction."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome as repurposed relic mirrors theme, constraining final performance; seedy bars ("Rusty Compass," crates) tactile and purposeful. Sensory hierarchy via Elias's graceful hands amid grime sharpens contrasts. Radar dome charges closure image, evolving from studio to stage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) signaled in whisper, escalates accumulatively via shows' discomfort, critic confrontation, to final release tightening to Charged Poise. Agency in cutting strings forecloses directive control with cost felt in puppets' independence. One deepening suffices, cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of stories as conversations/questions emerges organically from reversed tales and puppet release, resonating in final brush strokes without moralizing. Subtext in moral ambiguity charges reversals; counter-readings linger via critic sneer. Minor echo in "ethical violation" line borders statement but integrates via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with serene, biased perception (graceful hands tracing scars); voice texture modulates poetically yet legible, diction character-specific. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why not?"), advances via critic exchange. Rhythmic control peaks in final hushed image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short queries amid fluid sweeps), propulsion aligns with epiphanic cadence. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("velvet curtain," "dust motes") lacks payoff, but no loops or artifacts dull closure. Final line's concrete characters recharge without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy/puppets/reversals in bars transforms ethical trope via story stick's scars; risk in string-cutting heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits to ambiguity without hedging, inevitable in hindsight via dome's watchful relic.</comment>
