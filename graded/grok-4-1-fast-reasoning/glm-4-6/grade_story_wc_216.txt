<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in persistent need intensifies through discoveries, compelling descent; final reconfiguration of borrowed time from curse to gift feels earned with embodied awe ("surge of awe, his borrowed time suddenly feeling less like a curse"). Interiority concrete but occasionally abstract; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal moments like fragment handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of discoveries (fragment etchings to journal); CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in reweighted time perception ("texture of time passing no longer a fear but a comfort"). Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening via coordinates descent suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silo constrains choices (descent into colder levels) and charges final image (alcove journal); sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered ("air thickening with an impossible weight," "walls echoing"). Evolving environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reassembling capsule for understanding) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via pattern emergence; agency in cross-referencing/descent narrows options with felt time pressure. Escalation coherent but low visceral tension—discoveries resolve smoothly without trade-offs foreclosing live paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory's resilience emerges organically from particulars (urn to journal); final image offers resonant CR ("even in a broken world, there were stories worth telling") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in garage codes enriches without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time-obsessed lyricism: "time itself had become a fragile, whispered thing"); rhythmic modulation under discovery pressure. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("mysteries" thrice in close proximity) and repetitive "time" phrasing dull some beats; figurative density overwrites in opening without full pattern payoff. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic garage-sale codes and urn-map transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable method ("embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions"). Conceptual integrity commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
