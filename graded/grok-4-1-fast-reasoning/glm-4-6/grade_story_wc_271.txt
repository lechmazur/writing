<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in freezes and handwork; contradictory impulses act in traumatic vs. transcendent freeze; earned change in framing photo shows hierarchy of values with cost of exposure. Minor therapy-speak in "somatic markers" but dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to charged poise in cliff pause (final para); orientation anchored early (cliffside arboretum, post-drone strike); closure as RR with conceptual cost of integrated grief legible in "joy and sorrow coexist."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum with salt wind, junipers, sea thrift constrains choices (salt-tolerant plants mirror endurance) and charges final cliff-edge image; sensory hierarchy via POV's botanical bias vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trauma integration signaled early, escalates accumulatively via transcendent freeze deepening knowledge; agency in framing photo forecloses hiding with felt cost; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via root metaphors emerges organically from garden actions; final image non-literally answers integration question, reweighting prior trauma with ambiguity of ongoing squalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in botanical noticing; rhythmic control modulates from wind-whipped urgency to stillness; diction purposeful without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but −0.4 for paraphrase loops ("quietly talented hands" x2, "somatic markers" x2, "pearl of stillness" reprises) dulling some beats without pattern payoff; rhythm varies naturally overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone trauma, gardening resilience, lighthouse wisdom avoids templates; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes; transformation test passes via specific arboretum details.</comment>
