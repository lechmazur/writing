<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits like disguising wisdom drive micro-choices such as the faint smile, but interior conflict remains summarized rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax stitch; embodied emotion in breath catching and hands flying adds specificity without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "conspiracies collapsed under the weight of his work, the coup postponed by a thread," legible cost in time running out; orientation anchored early in observatory; one tightening via new thread revelation narrows paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory and eternal candle constrain choices (sanctuary now dangerous, flame reveals thread) and charge final image of steady glow holding back darkness; autumn winds and deepening walls selectively mirror encroaching betrayal through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stitching truth against coup tightens texturally via faster hands and flame-revealed thread foreclosing silence; agency in final stitch pays cost of "encroaching chill," reweighting conspiracies; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of small acts (stitching/listening) against lies emerges organically from galaxy-chart and unheard stories, resonant in final image of shimmering threads and safe stories without moralizing; ambiguity in "some stories never meant to be heard" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (noticing threads/flame rhythms) stable in single close-third POV, modulating rhythm with intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("eternal candle’s flame flickering," "echoed silence," "conspiracies unraveling") and template cadence ("The [element] [verb], its [description]") across beats dull propulsion and density, obscuring closure image; overwriting with figuratives in every peak line; rhythm varies minimally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer mapping cosmic conspiracies via thread/candle transforms tropes organically; final reconfiguration of "loose threads" feels inevitable from particulars; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
