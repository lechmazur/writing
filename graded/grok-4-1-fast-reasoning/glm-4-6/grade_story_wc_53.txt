<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (regret anchors vs. resolute collecting), with micro-choices like gripping the wheel revealing values; final endurance of regret with freedom feels earned but borders on articulated epiphany in "realized the stories weren’t for the ghost."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via fragments and images culminating in RR (Charged Poise) at wheel crumbling and horizon step; cost legible in "regret was still there, but it no longer defined him" reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (boots sinking mist, cool plastic, humming) filtered through scavenger POV constrain collecting and charge final thinning mist/edge image, mirroring internal erosion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape ghost/regret via stories) signaled early, escalates texturally via failed recitation and wheel crumble tightening to Charged Poise; agency in walking forecloses entrapment with legible cost in lingering ghost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of claimed stories vs. imposed ghosts emerges organically from wheel/mist motifs shifting meaning; resonant final image reweights premise without moralizing, though "ghost was gone, and so was the regret" slightly tidies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical texture and perceptual bias (twisted memories, whispering lagoon); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure, rhythmic control modulates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but final third paraphrase loops ("regret still there but...", "once cage now memory", "end not an end") dull closure image slightly; no major artifacts obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of scavenger ghost-negotiation via story-fragments in kinetic lagoon transforms loss tropes organically; risk in lyric drive heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
