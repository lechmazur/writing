<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in impatience-patience tension compels patient tracking to climax shift, with embodied tremble revealing contradiction; interiority concrete in "hands tremble slightly" against purposeful routine. Minor slips in summary phrasing like "wildness that roiled" dilute peak embodiment without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine density builds to pattern ID ("three lunar cycles after"), descent, and RR closure via wave reconfiguration with internal cost ("impatience within her begin to reshape"). Orientation anchored early (sanctuary, lake); one tightening at alignment sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake ice "glowed with reflected starlight," viaduct constrain choices (descent path, connection site) and charge final dawn image; sensory cold "crystallize each breath" filters through POV urgency. No slips; micro-setting (ice, viaduct) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient revolution) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cycles to on-page deepening at alignment forcing endurance trade-off; cost legible in "restrained wildness of growing roots" wave and generational acceptance. Agency in vigilant mapping narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting patience emerges organically from tracking particulars to resonant final image ("horizon that would now reveal... what patient hands could gradually make"), reweighting impatience observations without moralizing. Subtext in societal notes layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("eyes traced boundaries," moon paths); lyrical texture modulates rhythm from routine to peak "something shifted." No head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; metaphors like "captured star" purposeful without muddle in peak ("wave of patience emanated"). Minor figurative density pre-climax but no loops or scaffolds dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horizon mapping, lunar-ice electromagnetics distilling societal patience transforms mystic trope organically; viaduct revolution feels inevitable from particulars, with bold conceptual risk charging quiet closure.</comment>
