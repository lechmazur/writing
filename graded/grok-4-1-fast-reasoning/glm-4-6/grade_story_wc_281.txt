<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as affectionate skeptic shine in pivot from suppression to translation via somatic evidence, earning shift to cartographer; embodied stress markers reveal character under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through dance to RR closure in "pocket of stillness" with legible cost (aching body); orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Muscovite sliver as micro-setting constrains choices (anchor) and charges final image ("cool surface a testament"); sensory details selectively filter through artistic POV, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map noise tightens via somatic-to-light method, agency in dance forecloses suppression path; cost unmistakable in exhaustion charging "body aching but spirit soaring."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of catastrophe-to-architecture emerges organically from particulars, final geode pickup reweights noise-as-fractal without moral; resonant ambiguity in intertwined emotions lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (fractal/shimmering motifs) biases toward wonder-skeptic lens, rhythmic modulation heightens dance pressure; stable close-3rd POV with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring dance flow, no loops/artifacts; figurative pattern (light/bleed) taught early pays off without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy recall into somatic light-art mapping feels inevitable, transforms tropes via fractal precision; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
