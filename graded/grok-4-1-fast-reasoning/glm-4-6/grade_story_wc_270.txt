<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in insurgent spirit and grandmother's secret teaching drives higher-stakes descent and unsealing; interiority concrete via plant whispers and symbol-tracing embodiment. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—resolute throughout—caps at strong rather than exceptional; epiphany "truth finally clicked" borders on unearned summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: telepathy→kite discovery→decoding→unsealing forms motivated chain narrowing options against regime curfew. Orientation anchors Maeva/hot springs/reconstruction by para 1. Closure DC lands on-page as amber cracks/releasing potential with conceptual cost of breaking implanted destiny cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic setting constrains via treacherous path/boiling springs, filters through Maeva's bias (sacred hiding spot), charges closure as hybrids sprout amid ferns/vents. Sensory vivid/POV-shaped: steam/earth's womb mirrors evolution theme without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (amber's glow/palm-size) enables tracing glyphs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition vs. rigid destiny/regime) signaled early, tightens causally via decoding to curfew-defying unseal forcing trade-off with arrest risk. Agency in glyph-tracing forecloses rigid path; cost felt in "plants sang" reconfiguration. Entry to 8.8+ via legible price, minor abstractness in "wave of potential" holds back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges organically from kite-script realization to hybrid sprouting, reweighting premise without moralizing; final image of adapting wisdom answers question non-literally. Murmur "amber contains two possible futures" risks explicitness but anchors subtext via prior causality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (plants "whisper"/roots "remember"); diction/rhythm modulate urgency in descent ("steeper...boiled with otherworldly vigor"). No dialogue; purposeful compression in decoding evenings pays off at glyph-tracing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: sentences advance via causal embeds (e.g., "practiced fingers traced...each symbol burning"); varied rhythm accelerates to climax. Minor overwriting in opening "insurgent spirit burned brighter than the steam" risks purple but doesn't muddle closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants/kite-script unsealing transforms destiny trope via volcanic evolution; risk in unconventional method (kite tail glyphs) heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on rebellion-through-tradition feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
