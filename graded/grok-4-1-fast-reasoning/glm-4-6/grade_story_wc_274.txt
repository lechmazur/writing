<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to flight, rooted in clarity-seeking traits, with embodied emotions like breath hitching and trembling fingers. Internal conflict shown in weighing consequences during placement but undermined by repeated diagnostic labels ("bravely conflicted mind/soul") that feel unearned mid-crisis. Final resolve hardens with felt cost of pursuit, earning stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: entry → placement → activation → spread → flight narrows options with tightening at network pulse. Orientation anchored early ("cryogenic archivist, Elara... echoing library under snow"). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final flight image, cost legible in sirens and hardening resolve; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snowy library vividly selective (frost shelves, blue light, server hum), narrowing to immediacies under stealth pressure; snow muffles world, constrains escape into shadows. Recurring snow charges final image ("blanketing... fires burned underneath"), mirroring internal disruption. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spread truths undetected) signaled early, tightens causally at activation/spread forcing flight trade-off. Agency in micro-choices (scanning, placing) forecloses capture path with visible cost (sirens, hunt). Escalation coherent under causal lens, moral calculus in chaos-vs-clarity sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of truths' necessity emerges organically from act and spread, resonating in final image of unraveling world/fires under snow without moralizing. Subtext in shadows/ghosts implies buried lies. Minor slip: near-thematic echo ("Contraband truths weren’t just dangerous—they were necessary") borders statement over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ghostly movements, frost heat contrast); voice texture poetic, modulating rhythm under stress (short fleeing sentences). No head-hopping or withholding; diction POV-plausible, perceptual bias in noticing echoes/thoughts. Prose as character reflects conflicted resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("echoing library under snow" x4, "contraband truths" x5+, "bravely conflicted" x3) create synonym churn and template cadence, dulling closure image. Overwriting in peak beats (shadow "dancing," veil "torn") mixes metaphors without pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion. Density low from redundancies; rhythm varies but artifacts pervade final third, capping high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cryo-library truths-spreading transforms rebel trope via frozen society/digital tomb freshness. Final CR (networks hum triumph) inevitable from particulars, bold poetic litany risks heighten stakes. No derivative hedging; synthesis of stealth/snow/revolution feels organic vision.</comment>
