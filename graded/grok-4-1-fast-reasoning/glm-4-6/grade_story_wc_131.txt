<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to connect selectively is rooted in concrete traits like curiosity and methodical care, shown through micro-choices like caching the tape; interiority feels particular via sense memory of father's tapes. Blind spots in isolation drive his hidden existence without safety-hedging. Final smile after her wonder earns a credible endurance with felt cost of ongoing invisibility to most.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hidden paths, memories, and clues builds to librarian's discovery as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring isolation into quiet transmission with conceptual cost of selective visibility. Orientation anchors early (crawl space, dawn outage). One tightening via flickering lights narrows time for caching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's beams, pipe chases, and crawl spaces constrain choices (retracing without trace); sensory details like metallic tape smell filter through Elias's priorities. Final image of tape in light charges closure. Dawn hush and outage evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (selective visibility via clues) signaled early, tightens texturally as outage window closes and discovery lands; agency in caching forecloses exposure risk. Cost legible in time pressure and his enduring sanctuary. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens via deepening pattern of left clues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of guardians preserving hidden narratives emerges via tape fragment linking past/present, resonating in her wonder without statement. Final image reweights premise: visibility to "those who need you" as quiet current. Complexity in his isolation avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (tracing beams like bones); voice lyrical yet precise, modulating from hush to thrill at discovery. No head-hopping; slight widen at end serves Charged Poise. Rhythm breathes with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("aged bones," "sapphire hush") integrated into action; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase in methodical repetition, but no loops dull closure. Varied syntax avoids monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library poltergeist as benevolent archivist transforms trope via tape sense memory and selective clues. Risk in unseen orchestration heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully.</comment>
