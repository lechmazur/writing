<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong zen patience and phototropic kindness drive observation to earned understanding, embodied in potter's hands tracing glass; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations tightening to CR closure ("thrum softened... fractures were gone") with felt cost of patient offering; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring glass and smoke constrain revelation choice and charge final image; selective sensory details (thrum in teeth, crystallized honey) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding escalates via density to nexus/smoke cadence shift narrowing options; agency in patient ritual forecloses struggle with legible calm cost, fitting lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cherished kindness shielding time emerges organically from bee/logbook/glass particulars; final "sharp gentleness of the truth settled" offers resonant non-literal reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light splits, shadows charted) with rhythmic control; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; figurative layering (fractured light, grey river smoke) pattern-taught without muddle, minor density in descriptive beats doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal preservation via kindness in wasteland/beehive frame; risk-taking lyric observation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via glass/smoke nexus.</comment>
