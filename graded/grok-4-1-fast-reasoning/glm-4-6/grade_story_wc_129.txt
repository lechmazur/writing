<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in Kael's ache for community, earned through sculptures and dedication; Elara's bold sympathy anchors effectively. Minor slip in stock interiority like "heart a vessel of luminescence aching" lacks full embodiment. Final change feels credible without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: myth → search → incomplete tag → creation tightens to Charged Poise closure with arbor blooming. Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater. Cost legible in Kael's dawn work and flickering luminescence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like prism fruit and crater shadows constrain search and charge final blooming image. Sensory integration mirrors internal states purposefully, e.g., "shadows danced like forgotten words." Recurrent light/prisms evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kinship via arbor bloom) signaled early, deepens via incomplete tag despair forcing realization "not about finding it." Accumulative pressure narrows to dedication agency; cost in effort forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared creation rekindling kinship emerges organically from particulars, resonating in "We became the art" without overt moralizing. Final image reweights premise non-literally. Minor echo in repeated "webs" keeps it grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulate poetically yet legibly. Dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., Elara's "It's waiting... An answer. A sign." Voice distinct between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in key beats; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "webs of kinship" and light motifs purposeful but border artifact in ending. No major scaffold; figurative language coherent, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline orchard quest and street-art myth transforms kinship trope via sculptures/tag completion. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable in hindsight.</comment>
