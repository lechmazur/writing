<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in heat-mapping the cave's hues and fossil's warmth spreading through her; motivation intensifies credibly from gnawing silence to conduit role with earned clarity. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal glow/vision beat, tilting toward resolute competence without deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory impressions densify to opalescent glow, fossil float, and shell spin for CR closure reweighting silence as waiting bridge with conceptual cost of crossing into unknown. Orientation anchored early in cave network; single scene causality tight, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp limestone grooves, tidal pool ripple, humming vibrations) filter through Elara's map-maker bias and constrain path (narrowing walls, colder air to central chamber). Fossils as micro-setting charge final image, mirroring internal shift from silence to melody.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via glow deepening to visions and shell reprise narrowing options to conduit path; agency in mapping triggers turns with felt emotional cost (gnawing purpose resolved into pounding clarity). One tightening sufficient, cost legible in "heart pounding with newfound clarity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging lost eras via relics emerges organically from fossil visions and map alive with glow, culminating in resonant final image of fossils as lanterns without moralizing. Complexity lingers in mystical paradox reweighting unknown as canvas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in feeling-based noticing (tingling skin, hues of emotion); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, peaking in vision flood. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coherent and biased to sensory craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length for propulsion; vivid specificity replaces generics (opalescent glow, elm veins in stone). Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors during glow beat (e.g., "shimmering, opalescent glow she’d never seen before") slightly dulls peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation relics as mystical bridges transformed via sensory mapping and "factually mystical" paradox; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with fossils' reprise feeling inevitable. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
