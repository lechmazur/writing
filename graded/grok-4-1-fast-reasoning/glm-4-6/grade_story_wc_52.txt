<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in calloused hands and economical cuts revealing Elara's transformation of grief, with internal contradiction between sorrow and creation acting in scene; final signing earns stasis with felt cost of ongoing hollows. Minor slips in reflective summaries like "harvested lessons from grief" border diagnostic abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from initial cuts to completed figure, one tightening in nearing completion and realization of Tomas's essence; Charged Poise closure in "record and a resurrection" with conceptual cost of "heal around its hollows" legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in loft/skylight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skylight raindrops and shavings constrain carving choices and charge final image as "crystallized time"; sensory hierarchy (visual rain, tactile grain, auditory kettle/whistle) reflects Elara's priorities. Vivid, selective integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, evolving with rain slowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief via carving) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through progress and embodied realizations narrowing to endurance; cost visible in calloused hands and "space for heart to heal around its hollows." Agency in persistent micro-choices forecloses dissolution path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of re-membering presence emerges organically from carving parallels to lion-taming, charged by shifting images like raindrops/man; final image resonantly reweights "here and gone" without literal moral. Minor friction in near-explicit "love transforms but does not end."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in grief-carved lens (e.g., shavings as "soft snow"); rhythmic control modulates from steady cuts to piercing whistle, distinct lyrical texture purposeful for accumulative mode. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., kettle rumble disciplines meandering); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, syntax propels toward closure. Minor artifacts in synonym loops around "grief" process and dense metaphors like "herbarium of moments" verge on overwriting without obscuring final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-tamer widow as carver transforms grief trope through specific ash parallels to animal handling; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious "domestic version of what his had done with fearsome beasts" inflects turns inevitably.</comment>
