<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent traits like calloused hands and sculptor’s eye ground Lyra, but interiority leans abstract ("perpetually learning mind piecing together") without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the storm’s peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as slide images build density linking past sculptures to purpose; CR closure lands on-page when slide placement lights archway and calms storm, with legible cost in endured isolation and reframed wanderings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and driftwood constrain choices (refuge, shoreline trek), charging final image of sculptures as markers; sensory hierarchy (waves crashing, slide glow) reflects sculptor’s tactile bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose post-GPS fail tightens via slide’s deepening revelations narrowing chaos to alliances; agency in visiting sites forecloses aimless drifting with felt storm cost, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art weaving land-sea alliances emerges organically from slide-sculpture links; final image of archway lighting reconfigures prior wanderings non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in grain-tracing and hum-sensing; voice modulates poetically but drifts to elevated diction ("timewoven alliances") clashing slightly with lived-in sculptor lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("turbine-hum reverie," "reimagine," "layered meanings") create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling propulsion; overwriting in peak storm ("images rearranging themselves") mixes metaphors without payoff, obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magic slide mapping sculptures transforms lost-GPS trope into fresh time-art alliances; bold lyric synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in accumulative reconfigurations heightening closure.</comment>
