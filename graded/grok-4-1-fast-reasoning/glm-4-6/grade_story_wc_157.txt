<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's charm hardening to resolve in the raid moment ("charm faded, replaced by something harder") reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning the final real smile as endurance with cost. Interiority concrete and embodied (hope "settling in his chest"; fireflies in jar). Group characters apply pressure without diluting his drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shards build pattern density from meeting plans to raid wreckage, culminating in CR via wildflower symbols amid "scarred" earth—cost legible in on-page image reweighting defiance as persistent detail. Orientation anchored early (Silas in greenhouse post-Tax). Transitions legible ("Weeks later"; "One evening").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains meetings (moth shadows "like fragmented thoughts"; bioluminescent fungi lighting faces) and charges final HQ image; gardens tactile (soil "cool under his nails"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Silas thrives in "chaos"). Environment subtly mirrors internal rebellion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard untaxed thoughts) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via raid news to double-down choice narrowing options. Agency in "double down" and planting forces trade-off, cost visible in uprooted marigolds/"scarred" earth charging final poise. Pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion in "spaces between the words" emerges organically via planting syntax and symbol motifs, reweighted non-literally by wildflower etching—resonant answer to Tax premise without moralizing. Subtext in whispers, grins; complexity in bold risk vs. paranoia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mischief-glint spectacles; chaos-thriving lens). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (librarian scoff tests proposal; botanist traces seed). Rhythm modulates intensity; diction textured yet controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "gourd rattle seed, its surface etched with tiny, candidly cryptic symbols" advances prop/voice/stakes). No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short stress sentences in raid). Minor chaos-repetition doesn't dull propulsion or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope (thought Tax) into garden-language rebellion with fresh synthesis of entomology/chaos/symbols, inevitable in wildflower CR. Risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes; no hedging, fully commits to premise implications.</comment>
