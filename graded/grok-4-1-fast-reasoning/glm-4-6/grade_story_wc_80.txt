<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as archeologist of dreams is rooted in ritual actions like wedging notes into gaps, earning endurance against water's claim; stoically sensitive trait shows via precise movements despite trembling hands. Internal conflict emerges in valuing scars over valuables, with embodied emotion in kneeling amid shards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations tightening to Charged Poise CR in final image of drawbridge as "wound slowly closing," reweighting legacy vs. oblivion with legible deadline cost via warning horn. Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion's skeletal remains and glass shards constrain choices (noting hollow sections before water rises) and charge final image; sensory details like "sunset's hued blaze" on face filter through surveyor's professional gaze on foundations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving history escalates accumulatively via deepening absences and deadline horn, narrowing options to final note placement; agency in ritual forecloses full documentation with felt cost of leaving as water swirls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memories persisting in architectural scars emerges organically from note-placing ritual and inkwell's history, answered resonantly in final map-marking as breadcrumbs through time without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in architectural silences and scars; rhythmic prose modulates from precise survey to charged lyricism at "silence had briefly spoken volumes," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative language ("interlaced absence," "bruised canvas") taught early as voice pattern; minor paraphrase loops in water imagery do not obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-archeologist transforms loss trope via note ritual in time-bound setting, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes in final reconfiguration of absence as preserved legacy.</comment>
