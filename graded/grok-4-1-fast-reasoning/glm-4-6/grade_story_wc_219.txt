<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong skeptical interiority with embodied doubt ("doubt crack like the tower stones") drives micro-choices like following footprints and placing amber; earned shift to belief via prior rebellion against herd; minor epiphany abstraction slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure when amber placement shimmers air and absorbs into tower, reweighting skepticism with legible cost ("more alone than ever"); orientation anchors early (tower, Aris, pilgrimage); single tightening via ascent suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower and overgrown path constrain ascent choices and charge final image (rain washes dust but burns footprints); sensory hierarchy (bronze quiet, metallic scent) filters through skeptic's priorities; purposeful weather evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. homecoming chemistry) signaled early tightens texturally via deepening images to placement reversal, narrowing doubt with agency-driven cost ("glow remains inside him"); one cadence shift at pedestal suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as elemental alignment emerges organically from particulars (tower catalyst, amber absorption), reweighting artificial pilgrimage in final image without moralizing; resonant CR answers initial doubt with non-literal believer's pull.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("chemistry of homecoming," "poorly designed experiment") modulates rhythm under rising reverence; stable close-third POV biases toward luminous skepticism; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and interiority with varied rhythm; recurring "bronze quiet" purposeful without loops; minor long-sentence runs in ascent beat but propel texturally without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms first-contact pilgrimage via skeptic's alchemical lens and amber catalyst; risk-taking in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically; non-obvious CR (tower as machinery) feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
