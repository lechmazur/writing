<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compile fragments intensifies compellingly through discoveries like the valve and game, with concrete interiority in obsessions like empty shelves. Micro-choices reveal values under communal pressure. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal beats, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from valve to community wave to exhibit (RR/Charged Poise), reconfiguring formless absences with legible cost in "absences could never be fully navigated." Orientation anchored early at docks. One tightening via Kai's recognition suffices; shards pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain vividly anchors with mist, spray, reflecting lights mirroring recovery; valve as micro-setting charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archivist notices gaps). Setting guides arrivals and exhibit gathering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compile to navigate absences) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via valve, fragments, game forcing staggered tactics; cost legible in "not overwhelm" and final acknowledgment. Agency in Elara's visionary methods coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-from-fragments emerges organically via valve, sailcloth, game; final image resonant reconfiguration answers without moralizing. Particulars like cut-out photos avoid platitudes. Complexity in persistent absences lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (gaps, fragments); voice textured, rhythmic modulation fits accumulative build. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("cannot hearten everyone"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("sunlight breaking through clouds") and label-like "reactively visionary" slightly dull peak exhibit reveal. No loops; propulsion strong. Minor scaffold in fragment repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh archivist-of-absences premise transforms exile trope via valve's mechanics and staggered revelations; valve reprise inevitable in hindsight. Bold accumulative shards heighten ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
