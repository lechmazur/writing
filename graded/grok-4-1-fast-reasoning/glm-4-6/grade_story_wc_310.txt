<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to encode warnings intensifies credibly through her ritual, with doubt resolving into purpose via coin-casting, but interiority leans abstract ("stellar doubt permeated even the vacuum") rather than embodied contradiction in pivotal alignment moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as prophecy layers and static bursts densify toward CR closure in final coin cast and deck preservation; orientation anchored early on observatory deck; cost legible in her smile amid singularity ("wavelength finally aligned").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ambered deck and dwindling photons constrain ritual choices and charge final image of preserved spacetime engraving; sensory selection (thin atmosphere, coin echoes) filters through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warning vs. blessing via lot-casting) tightens via burst intensification and prophecy cascade under accumulative lens, forcing alignment agency; cost felt in doubt's dissolution during final cast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclic purpose from doubt emerges organically via backward prophecies and coin modulation, reweighted non-literally in closing cycle image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in temporal inversion focus; rhythmic prose modulates cosmic scale effectively, diction consistent with Elara's specialist lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering risks overwrite in prophecy descriptions ("languages being remembered before they were invented"), with minor paraphrase loops on "backwards prophecies"; propulsion holds but template cadence dulls some bursts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cosmic contraction fused with backward causality and coin-calibration offers fresh synthesis, with risk-taking in accumulative CR cycle paying off inevitably in spacetime engraving.</comment>
