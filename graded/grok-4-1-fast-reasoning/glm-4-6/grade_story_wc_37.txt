<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to rekindle via songs is consistent and intensifies with past failure recall, compelling choices like plucking and singing; embodied emotion in "breath hitched" and "hands trembled" reveals resolve. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning on summary reflection over micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragile note builds to deepening melody and light spill, with one tightening via anchored past failure; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "chest ached with bittersweet release," reconfiguring endless night with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent trees, warped glass, and mica window are vividly sensory and POV-filtered, constraining actions like pressing palms; orchard pulses and blooms charge final image as "map of the rekindled realm."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling realm signaled early, escalates accumulatively via melody deepening against prior shattering notes; agency in swaddling and pressing incurs visible cost in trembling hands and ache, narrowing to healing reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-weaving emerges organically through threads/stitches/tapestry images, culminating in resonant final "constellation" reweighting scattered premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of musical metaphors; diction modulates from deliberate steps to raw song, suiting accumulative pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overwriting in climax ("light spilling... pooling... cascading... seams of gold stitching") mixes metaphors and risks muddle; minor loops on "scattered memories" and "woven" variations dull peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical orchard/lute-songs synthesis transforms memory-healer trope into inevitable mirror-world healing; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via endless night retreat without gimmickry.</comment>
