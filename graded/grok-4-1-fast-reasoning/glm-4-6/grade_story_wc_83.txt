<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief drives obsession with potential mapping, embodied via geode thumbing and bleak exhilaration in chest; contradictory horror/ecstasy impulses act in final hunt prep. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels until earned. Minor therapy-speak in "cocktail of bleak exhilaration" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds from power failure to pattern discovery to classroom target. Orientation anchored early (observatory, thermosphere, wedding cue). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in "prepar[ing] for the descent" with "anticipatory horror and ecstasy" cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Geode as micro-setting handled repeatedly, mirroring screens ("patterns that mirrored") and vibrating to charge final image, constraining hunt via resonance. Sensory hierarchy: humming, flickering blue glow narrow to crystal thrum under focus. Atmosphere tensions isolation with pulsing potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting potential) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tragedy pattern to classroom target, narrowing to descent agency. Felt cost in "horror and ecstasy of touching something that should not exist." One tightening via algorithm ID suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformed potential emerges organically from geode-screen echo and wedding perturbations, reweighted in final "hunter of... what might have been" without statement. Subtext in unspent moments invites ambiguity on grief's ethics. Resonant CR recharges prior imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: physics-grief bias notices "hexagonal formations repeating like mathematical proofs." Rhythmic modulation builds to terse final beats. Voice texture distinct in syntax blending science and metaphysics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("relay-sensitive hearts," "orthogonal to the vector") muddles peak discovery beat. No loops, but repetitive "potential" phrasing borders synonym churn. Propulsion clear, rhythm varies for build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum grief-harvesting transforms drone-survivor trope via Potential Mapper and geode resonance. Risky conceptual physics of unlived lives inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
