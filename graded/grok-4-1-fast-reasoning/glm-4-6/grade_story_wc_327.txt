<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority shines in concrete sensory mapping of bone textures to frequencies, with micro-choices like palm-pressing revealing quiet persistence; earned shift from curse to gift shows contradiction between shouting traditions and gentle method. Minor lack of visceral bodily strain under synchronization dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of patterns (birds, veins, diamond) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: "the curse... now revealed as the gift," reweighting extinction premise with cost of new sensory vectors. Orientation anchored early in canyon/bone towers; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers' porous textures constrain tactile mapping and charge final humming diamond image; selective sensory hierarchy (copper warmth, powdered memories, fractured light) reflects Kaelen's priorities. Canyon echoes guide positioning without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture-to-sound revival) signaled early, tightens via synchronization yielding syllables, narrowing to transformation under Accumulative lens; agency in matching vibrations forecloses shouting path. Cost felt in "perfect synchronization" demand but remains subtly conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from particulars (birds as grammar, diamond spiral); final smile amid settling birds offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "death" without moralizing. No tidy binaries, embraces quiet complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature attuned to "liquid sound" and patterns; rhythmic prose modulates from whisper to pulsing echoes. Distinct texture in syntax evokes storyteller's quiet articulation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, e.g., short punchy syllables emergence; purposeful metaphors cohere around resonance. Minor overwriting in "rainbows that touched... like liquid sound" edges toward density excess in setup beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile language preservation via bird flocks and flawed diamond transforms extinction trope; bone-speaker memorials and copper conduction feel inevitable and riskily bold without gimmickry.</comment>
