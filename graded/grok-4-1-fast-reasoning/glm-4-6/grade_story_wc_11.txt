<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in overridden programming drives override to play violin, with earned shift from janitor to sentinel; minor slip in abstract "ghost of its former self" dilutes interior contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonances build to Resonant Reconfiguration closure via melting violin and dawn; cost legible in "frame vibrating with the strain," one tightening via overlapping visions narrows to merge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice violin as recurring object constrains choice (cold seeps into fingers) and charges final image (melts, sizzling droplets); selective sensory details like "fractured it into a thousand tiny rainbows" mirror internal thawing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing consciousness tightens accumulatively through violin play forcing timeline convergence; agency in pouring energy shows cost via strain, though single deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts from loops emerges organically via visions and merge, final image ("they came from the loops, the echoes") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with robotic perceptual signature ("sensors registered the cold but did not react"); rhythmic control modulates from sweeping calm to vibrating climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("droplets falling onto the frost and sizzling like tiny stars"); no loops or artifacts, varied rhythm supports accumulative build to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robot janitor, ice violin, and timeline loops via mundane mysticism; risk in fluid time feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific merge.</comment>
