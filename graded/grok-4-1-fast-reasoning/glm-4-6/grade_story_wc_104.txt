<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to plant resilience drives concrete micro-choices like reversing the key sequence and using chains as tools, with embodied cost in raw wrists and blood. Patiently strategic trait constrains actions under collapse pressure without labels dominating. Minor flaw: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses in peak decoding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chained decoding therefore misjudged note, therefore arrow-pattern adjustment opens vault (DC) with his collapse as felt cost in final lines. Orientation anchored early in carnival center amid wall collapse. Single scene tightens meaningfully without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival's stale popcorn, decay, and rusted beam constrain choices, with piano bench as micro-setting enabling decode and chains aiding final press. Sensory narrowing to groans, dust, clanks heightens crisis urgency. Final vault light charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vault access before collapse) signaled early, tightens causally via misjudged note narrowing options, forcing arrow-referenced adjustment with bloodied cost. Agency in desperate precision forecloses failure path. Wall rumble pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from seed vault pursuit amid ruin, reweighted in final clutching of glowing arrow and "growth would follow" image without moralizing. Staggering grace subtext in chained endurance contrasts desolation. Particulars like ironwood fletching avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward code patterns and endurance symbols; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically under stress, compressing in climax ("fingers flew"). No head-hopping or withholding; voice distinct without dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences in peak ("The ground shook, dust coating his tongue"), high density integrates action and image without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("funeral bells") in pressure but coherent and voice-motivated. Propulsion clear to vault-open cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Piano keys as frequency code and bark-fletched arrow matching pattern transform post-apoc tropes via specific logic; carnival vault premise fresh. Risky lyric compression of decode pays off in reverse-sequence turn without gimmickry.</comment>
