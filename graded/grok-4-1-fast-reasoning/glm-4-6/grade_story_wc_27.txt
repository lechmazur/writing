<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "posture stiff but her gaze unshakable," embodied in toes gripping concrete and hum resonating in bones; final stance earned via palm placement foreclosing doubt with felt chest spark. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing. Interiority particular and voice coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scanning room to hum intensification at palm contact, delivering Charged Poise closure where "heart alight with rediscovery" reconfigures prior adrift state with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stone circle constrains pivotal choice (tracing glyphs to palm placement) and charges final image via softening hum; sensory details like "toes gripping cold concrete" and "brass chiming" filter through stargazer's bias, mirroring internal shift from graveyard decay to reignition. Coherent choreography, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in lull) signaled early, tightens via hum deepening at "vibrations rippling...into her heart," narrowing doubt to purpose with legible cost in "hollows of her chest." Agency in micro-choices culminates in Charged Poise; lens-consistent escalation via textural density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-reignition emerges implicitly via hum drowning doubt, answered non-literally in final "smile, awkwardly confident, ready to reignite...with a hum," reweighting rage with serenity. Resonance from particulars like opera glasses shifting inward; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in celestial filters ("dust motes...like distant galaxies"); rhythmic control modulates from quiet scanning to peak "thunderous serenity," stable close-third POV with no leakage. Texture purposeful and biased to stargazer's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "opera glasses swung...chiming softly, a counterpoint to the deep thrum" advancing image and sound; varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, propulsion aligns with hum's build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi rebellion with ancient stones and opera glasses as inward tools transforms lull trope into lyric reignition; risk in accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via hum's payoff.</comment>
