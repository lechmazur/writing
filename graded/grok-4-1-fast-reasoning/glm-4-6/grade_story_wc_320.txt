<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "impossible task: to find the beginning in every ending" drives micro-choices like placing the fragment; embodied emotion in heart racing and breath steadying shows contradiction under pressure, but epiphanies border on unearned abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in "signal from within the fragment itself, a ghostly echo," reweighting premise with cost in fading perigee; orientation anchored early in tower city over gorge; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tower's "steel bones vibrate" and gorge "holds its breath" constrain listening and mirror internal mysteries; fragment as micro-setting charges final pocketed hum; sensory hierarchy reflects interpreter's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interpret signal tightens accumulatively via density increase to source reveal and coherence; agency in discarding assumptions forecloses external origin path with temporary signal cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as story emerges organically from fragment's "laughter, applause"; final "every ending is just another frequency" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("shard of hush") stable in single POV; modulates rhythm under intensity, but minor repetition risks committee texture; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("Hollywood star fragment" x6, "gorge stretched/whispered") creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in peak signal beats; overwrought metaphors like "liquid silver" risk muddle without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Hollywood relic as signal vessel transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in fantasy practicality heightens stakes via grounded salvage ingenuity.</comment>
