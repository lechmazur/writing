<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in net-mending philosophy, compelling pursuit with embodied joy at loom realization; micro-choices like whistling align with traits. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making emotional progression serene rather than conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from parapet to workshop revelation; clear orientation by para 1. Conceptual Repricing at loom ("cosmic echo of effort and form") lands on-page with perceptual cost felt in heart-swelling joy, reconfiguring worldview; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (slick stones humming, wet earth scent) reflects POV priorities, guiding choices via moon paths on cobblestones. Workshop loom as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring nets and constraining realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher firefly patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as glow intensifies and paths sharpen to workshop discovery, narrowing to revelation via agency in following/whistling. Visible conceptual cost in altered perception charges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden connective effort emerges organically via firefly dance and loom echo, with CR at "connective tissue between all things" reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image (whisk as bridge) offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (pattern-seeing bias in firefly language, stone hum); poetic diction/rhythm modulates serene intensity. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies poetically, but repetitive phrasing ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "moon paths") creates paraphrase loops in opening/ending, dulling density (−0.6). Minor artifact in "forgotten工匠dragons' workshop"; overwrites peak realization slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending philosophy with firefly "moon paths" to cosmic loom transforms familiar wonder trope into specific, inevitable revelation. Risky lyric pursuit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
