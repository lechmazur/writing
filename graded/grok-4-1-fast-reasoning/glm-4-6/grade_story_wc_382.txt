<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation in tutor's secret obsession, embodied in heart racing and finger-hover over seal; contradictory impulses in lying vs. admitting peak at "I’m listening," earning relational shift. Elias applies crucible pressure without stereotypes. Minor tidy emotional progression at end slightly softens cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lies to seal-glow revelation and shared listening as RR/Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of foreclosed secrecy. One tightening via admission narrows options. Abrupt roof-to-study shift ("they’d been on the roof moments ago") creates minor spatial causality blur, docking high band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seal as micro-setting constrains listening choice and charges final image (griffin’s eyes glinting, warmth fading); rooftop jasmine/meteors selectively sensory, mirroring internal softening. Spatial choreography clear despite shard shift. Environment subtly guides revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hiding/revealing building language) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elias's insistence to seal-whisper climax, forcing admission with vulnerability cost. Agency in hovering fingers and endurance of truth. One reversal suffices; cost felt in melted lies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of lies as doorways to buried truths emerges organically via seal/building voices, reweighted in final "some lies are just doorways" image without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue silences; ambiguity lingers in seal's promise. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (half-hearing brick whispers); voice textured, modulating to brighter laugh at end. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("bring the sugar"), distinct idioms. Minor seam in location shift but elision fits lens payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (wax/intention). Minor overwriting in "lie smooth as aged parchment" and simile strings in reveal beat dull propulsion slightly (−0.3). No loops/artifacts touch closure; propulsion strong to dawn skyline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dead languages as living building speech unlocked by seal transforms tropes; risk in magical realism pays off in closure reconfiguration. Non-obvious angle on lies/truth feels inevitable via particulars. Bold premise commitment heightens stakes.</comment>
