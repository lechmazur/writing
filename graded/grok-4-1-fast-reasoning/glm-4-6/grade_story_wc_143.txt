<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve the lunar morning intensely compels endurance and setup choices; sand grain reprise earns final renunciation of the unaltered summit with personal cost. Interiority concrete via embodied exhaustion and curiosity-driven breakthrough, though some reflective summaries dilute contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to light crescendo and CR closure in photo review/packing, reweighting exploration's end with conceptual cost of commercialization. Orientation anchored immediately in lunar dust/crater; no shards or ambiguity, one tightening via chemical timing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlit summit and vacuum/cold/radiation constrain camera setup and outlasting, charging final glow image; sensory selectivity (violets/blues defying physics) mirrors POV priorities. Sand grain as micro-setting recurs to evolve from charm to timer essence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph last lunar morning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via phenomenon peak and bodily isolation, forcing endurance agency; cost legible in era-ending realization post-capture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of pure exploration's end emerges organically from corporate shadow and preserved image, with final photo/sand grain reprise offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward anomalies/colors; rhythmic modulation fits melancholy, though occasional elevated diction edges POV lexicon in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("purposefully curious," "dawning hush," "outlast") creates template cadence runs across beats, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in reflections (e.g., light show descriptions) reduce density without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Heirloom sand grain catalyzing chemical lunar photography transforms moon exploration trope via specific mineral interaction and era-shift stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
