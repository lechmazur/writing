<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to conquer the labyrinth drives micro-choices like retracing steps, but interiority abstracts into epiphanic labels ("the labyrinth wasn’t just in his mind. It was real") without embodied contradiction or degrading thought under peak stress like the scream-leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of loops tightening to CR closure: tablet shatters and hands lose glow, reweighting eternity as hollow cost; pattern taught early via procedural generation, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (neon veins, humming pavement, warping rails) constrains jumps and charges final image of plain street replacing viaduct; POV bias narrows to glow decay mirroring internal fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to escape labyrinth escalates via accumulative density (colliding timelines, obscene twists, shudder), narrowing options through agency in retraces/leaps; cost legible in lost eternity charging final walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-conquest as loss emerges organically from overlapping reflections and glow-fade; resonant CR in final rain-erased light reweights labyrinth premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of runes/glows; rhythmic modulation peaks in short, propulsive sentences during warp ("He jumped, gravity bending under his will").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Propulsive rhythm with varied syntax, but paraphrase loops ("retraced his steps" x3, darkening/brightness toggles x4) create mild redundancy dulling mid-beat density; overwrites slightly in "obscene shapes" without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural timelines as personal curse transforms game trope into hollow self-loss; risk in looping structure heightens stakes via inevitable erasure payoff.</comment>
