<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait drives consistent motivation and micro-choices like gathering supplies under time pressure; embodied emotions (heart thrumming, latent blaze) feel particular. Minor weakness in light internal contradiction—impulses align too neatly without simultaneous push-pull in the grotto harvest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via layered perception (doodle glow to map) holds to CR closure: final sunrise refraction reweights reality with protection cost legible in "she would need to protect these...until humanity was ready." One tightening via inversion hour narrows options; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist coils ankles and breathing walls constrain navigation, charging grotto choices; inversion gravity inverts objects, shaping threshold passage. Final crystal warmth integrates with prism-mind, mirroring expanded perception in sunrise image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest seeds) signaled early, tightens via inversion hour forcing entry; agency in stepping through stones forecloses normal paths with felt time cost. Escalation accumulates density to recalibration, but minor abstractness in "restore balance" softens visceral price until protection duty lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed reality arrangements emerges organically via doodle-map to crystal integration; final refracted sunrise offers non-literal resonant answer (new spectrums herald balance) reweighting myopia premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with prism-signature (refracting text/colors) modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful diction like "clandestinely luminous" sustains perceptual bias without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short inversion lurch, long mist whispers); minor metaphor churn ("latent blaze" reprises without muddle) in opening doesn't touch closure. No loops, clean propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perceptual fantasy (prism-mind decoding molecular philosophy) transforms portal tropes via inversion physics and vigilance seeds; risk in geologic mist-breathing heightens stakes organically.</comment>
