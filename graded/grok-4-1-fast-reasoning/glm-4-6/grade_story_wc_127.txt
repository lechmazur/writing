<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dealer's contradictory impulses—professional subsumption versus unexpected empathy—act simultaneously in the pivotal decision to amplify hope, earning the genuine smile and methodological shift with embodied cost ("familiar weight... seeds of truth"). Internal conflict particularized through static sensing and petal handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of static/emotion builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure: dealer sets petal down instead of bottling grief, reweighting from product to conduit with legible cost in personal shift ("methodology... quiet satisfaction"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via realization of chemist's true longing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains ritual and charges final image, evolving from closing walls to warmer sanctuary mirroring internal shift; light "thickening like honey" to "wrapping... like a blanket" integrates sensory bias via dealer's electricity-sensing. Blotters and stone table tactilely guide choices without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bend emotions without breaking—tightens accumulatively via pang realization narrowing options to amplify resilience, forcing agency in petal reprising with felt cost of diminished craft authenticity. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at "decided to amplify the half truths already present."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of counterfeit-to-real emerges organically from petal work shifting half-truths to "seeds of truth," final image resonantly reweighting premise without moralizing; counter-readings in enduring trade-offs linger purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in electricity-sensing and biased noticing (e.g., "ghost of a discontinued perfume"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in charge intensification, prose texture distinct and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated figuration ("dry, brittle thing, like old parchment") without muddle or loops; rhythm varies purposefully, sentence propulsion aligns with emotional cadence, no scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal emotion commerce via static/petals transforms detachment tropes, with risk in dealer's earned genuineness heightening stakes organically; premise's non-obvious angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
