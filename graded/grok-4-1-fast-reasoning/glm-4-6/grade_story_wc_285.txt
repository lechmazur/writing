<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in brother's palimpsest promise drives vigilant waiting with embodied sensory focus; earned change in handover moment forecloses past-bound vigil with felt emotional cost. Interiority concrete via ambient details, no stock phrasing. Minimal contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from ticking gutters to percolating whispers coalescing into boat reveal; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on-page with needle handover reconfiguring weight to lightness—"the weight of his vigil lift, replaced by the lightness of spindrift serenity"—felt cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing, rain gutters, yarn needle constrain vigil and charge final image (fog dissipates, colors vivid); sensory hierarchy (drip, squelch, clopping) reflects attentive POV bias, evolves causally with lifting mist. Micro-setting of boots in mud and anchored boat guides approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise via waiting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as whispers coalesce and fog lifts, narrowing to handover; agency in sustained attention forecloses endless vigil with on-page emotional price. Minor abstractness in promise details prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stitching fragmented memory emerges organically from needle, promise, ambient listening; final riding image offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration of past-to-present without moralizing. Recurring fog/serenity shifts meaning subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of ambient layers; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hushed vigil to quickened dawn, consistent under pressure. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("Until the rain gutters stopped ticking").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety with read-aloud cadence supports accumulative build; high density integrates sensory/motif work. Minor figurative density ("percolated... bubbling... whispers") borders overwriting in opening vigil beat, and fog/mist synonym near-loops dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly vigil, knitting relic as conduit, brother's eyes in figure transforms waiting trope via textured awareness; risk in lyric compression heightens eerie serenity without gimmick.</comment>
