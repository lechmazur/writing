<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through dance to compel transformation, rooted in tide dancer traits; interiority concrete via light veins and gaps observation. Lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax dance beat, leaning toward smooth progression without embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through 17 forms to Conceptual Repricing closure: verse formation reweights ban premise with identity-shedding cost legible in "loosens as the verse completed." Orientation anchored early in garden/exile; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden/crystal dome/obsidian circle constrain dance positioning and amplify starlight gaps; sensory hierarchy visual/tactile (moonstone warmth, skin rivulets) mirrors internal evolution. Final image of shifting script charges closure via micro-setting skin-as-canvas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fledge via gaps to transcend ban) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through forms/mind drift to dissolution with agency in surrender; cost felt in concentration and identity loss at "shedding her former identity." One decisive density cadence suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transcendence via gaps emerges organically from dance/images, not statement; final skin verse offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting nostalgia premise without moral. Complexity lingers in rebellion's terrible beauty, charged by particulars like dust universes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (gaps obsession) biasing details; rhythmic prose modulates from measured steps to flowing rivulets, reflecting mind under intensity. No dialogue; diction purposeful, eliding standard causality for taught lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., dance advances plot/character/atmosphere); rhythm varies, syntax propels to climax. Minor artifacts: "motivationれたed" proofreading slip and occasional figurative density in peak dance without muddle (−0.5); no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancing/gaps/nostalgia ban into skin-verse transcendence feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via cellular transformation. No derivative echoes; premise transformed through world logic (ban-proof gaps).</comment>
