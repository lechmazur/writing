<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "words she didn't know she remembered" during chant, driving ritual choices with embodied emotion (tear at first memory); contradictory longing shown in carrying ghostly flowers, but lacks simultaneous impulses clashing in pivotal chamber beat for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dock anomalies to coffee mapping to chamber ritual; closure as RR/Charged Poise lands on-page in "seventeen memories exhumed" and flowers left vibrant, with felt cost in stabilization and sacrifice; orientation anchored first line, one tightening at intrusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt crystals as lenses "focusing her intention" in chamber constrain ritual choices and charge climax shadows "peeling away layers of reality"; selective sensory (trembling petals, thick air) reflects urgency; recurring lantern/proximity evolves with gravity, mirroring internal retrieval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via coffee patterns narrowing to chamber tactics; gravity fluctuations force endurance with visible cost (lantern rising/falling, near-trip earlier); agency in fingertip tracing/chanting forecloses ghostly past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges organically through flowers reweighting from ghostly to vibrant; resonant CR in final harbor image, but "universal longing... nothing truly disappears" moralizes directly in penultimate sentence, diluting subtlety with thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV third-limited with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (grounds "spirals, lines, clusters"); rhythmic syntax modulates to short, charged ritual lines; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in ritual beat (grounds dance/settle mapping maze) with varied rhythm, strong verbs (exhumed, peeled); minor overwriting in crystal "facet catching and refracting" run approaches figurative density overload without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity folds trapping memories, coffee divination, whale catalyst into organic magical realism; ritual exhumation turn inevitable from prior particulars, risk-taking in quantum/mystical rules heightens stakes coherently to charged final image.</comment>
