<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied sensations like the watch humming and warming against skin; micro-choices to document patterns reveal values under pressure; earned realization ("she had been part of the library all along") forecloses external quest with personal cost. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneously acted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via watch cycles and staggered whispers holds to CR closure ("the library of unspoken words existed within, not without"), reconfiguring premise with conceptual cost of internal dissolution legible in dissolving mists and veil adjustment; persistent watch constraint shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring watch and mist-shrouded shelves constrain choices like navigating fissures and frantic noting; charges final image with watch ticking forward amid receding library; sensory details (breathing books, delayed echoes) vivid and POV-filtered for temporal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document unspoken truths before loss) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lengthening delays to stepping through gaps and accelerating cycles forcing frantic agency; cost unmistakable in library's inward-rolling tides and gained internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken power emerges organically via cycling books of "confessions never made" and final image of veil adjustment reweighting prior material as internal repository without moralizing; resonant CR links propagation delays to human connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature on temporal fractures ("whispers... staggered like waves"); stable close third-person POV; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure from cautious observation to frantic notation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length for propulsion; zero loops or scaffolds; figurative language (mists "rolling inward like tides") consistent and legible in peaks without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of reverse-time watch, propagation delays, and internal unspoken library transforms surreal quest into poignant CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
