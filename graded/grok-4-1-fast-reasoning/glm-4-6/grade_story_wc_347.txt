<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's motivation intensifies through embodied conflict (trembling fingers, lingering morning sickness) compelling precise assembly under bird threat; internal contradictions act in scene via clumsy slip steadying masterful hands. Final endurance of curse feels earned with visible cost in frost-kissed fingertips. Minor flaw: occasional stock mutter ("You'll get someone killed") borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain: nut + blueprint assembly → impressions create path → confuses birds → traveler saved; on-page Charged Poise closure in Tomas gathering warm nut amid rustling trees reconfigures ongoing burden with felt cost (humanity's remnant). Orientation anchored early (orchard edge, horizon frost). No unkept setups or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds constrain choices (motion triggers pursuit, gravel slip risks abyss); frost line as live micro-setting narrows tactics, charging final image of kisses on fingertips. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (curse-influenced soil, shifting symbols). Evolves causally (frost descends, crystals on wings).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide traveler pre-frost) signaled early, tightens via assembly reversal (slip triggers birds) narrowing options; agency in impressions forecloses death path with on-page cost (health strain, curse persistence). Protagonist-driven under causal lens, birds complicate via agency. Minor abstractness in declared orchard "hunger" vs. felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty in cursed duty emerges organically via particulars (clumsy retreat creates luminous path); final image of approving trees and returning caretaker offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in nut's warmth vs. frost cost. Counter-reading plausible in endless burden ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (curse-birthed paradox notices shifting symbols, warmth-seeking compass); voice modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences in bird shriek beat). Brief dialogue natural, goal-pursuing. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion (breath fogging in dropping temperature accelerates tension); high density in assembly beat. Minor artifacts: "晶体者" and "diagrams清晰的" as proofreading slips dull line clarity; no loops but occasional stacked modifiers ("impossibly light, its surface etched with symbols that shifted").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, blueprint device, touchless impressions transforms tropes via specific logic (curse paradox enables guidance); risk in graceless mastery heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at traveler's safe emergence. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity to premise.</comment>
