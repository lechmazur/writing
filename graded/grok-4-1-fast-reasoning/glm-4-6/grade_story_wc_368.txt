<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via heart rhythm syncing with wing shimmer; motivation intensifies from obsession to devotion through ritual, earning closure shift without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses (avoids memories yet chases resonance) act in scene. Final plunge into dye vat reveals hierarchy of values with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun trails map density increase to pattern break at alignment. CR closure lands on-page ("He understood") with conceptual cost (obsession foreclosed, purpose reconfigured). Orientation anchored early in tea house post-heart; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floorboards as sun trail map constrain observation ritual and charge final image; valley-mist sharpens inward focus mirroring internal resonance. Wing and teapot prism tactile, lived-in via handling. Sensory hierarchy dye-master specific (light shifts as pigment event).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn donor's magnetism) signaled early, escalates via ritual deepening under Accumulative lens to cadence shift at "detonated with light." Agency in patient attention forecloses inquiry path with cost (replaced by devotion). Subtle but coherent pressure via heart's subtle quicken.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prismatic attention emerges from wing/sun interplay, not statement; final image (dye vat plunge) non-literally answers central question, reweighting donor as "person who watched" with oblique emotional cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in "resonance" lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (light as "living event," colors character-specific); rhythm modulates from meditative to "cascading wave" intensity. Prose texture purposeful in compression (weeks pass via trails). No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines layer image/action (e.g., "light hit the prism... detonated"); rhythm varies with scene (soft dawn vs. harsh noon). No loops/artifacts; figurative coherent ("iridescent caution") taught early without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: donor heart as emotional prism via wing alchemy transforms transplant trope into attentive ontology. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at alignment realization; inevitable hindsight from trails motif without late rules.</comment>
