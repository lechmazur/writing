<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's evolution from "scheming" to genuine compassion feels earned through repeated healings, with pacifist traits consistently driving micro-choices like extending the box despite resistance. Internal conflict is embodied lightly in his sensing of cellular memory, avoiding therapy-speak. Limited contradictory impulses in peak moments (e.g., no visible cost to his own resentment) prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of Leo/Maya healings taught early builds density to Elias's self-healing CR closure, where "the broken cylinder pin glowed softly" reconfigures his purpose with felt acceptance cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Repetitive structure (six transformations summarized) slightly dilutes tightening, but single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shifting sanctuary walls (stone to mist, starlight) vividly constrain choices by amplifying releases, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Music box as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory selection (soundless yet melodic) reflects POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching resentment release) signaled early; accumulative deepening via six instances narrows to Elias's own cellular rewrite, with agency in persistent offering despite recoil (e.g., Maya's resistance). Cost legible in "cells exhaling" and self-healing price. No single reversal caps escalation slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-healing emerges organically from broken pin's melody shifting resentment; final image ("broken cylinder pin glowed softly") offers non-literal CR repricing without moralizing. Subtext in cellular memory invites reflection. Minor thematic echo in "healing comes... through acceptance" edges from 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (sensing souls' needs); voice modulates poetically under pressure, e.g., "melodies... incomplete yet beautiful." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Listen not with your ears but with your cells"). Rhythmic control strong, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in healing descriptions (e.g., "tears cascaded... releasing resentment" repeated structurally) and minor synonym churn ("shifting grace") create template cadence, dulling density in late beats. Rhythm varies read-aloud, but overwriting in metaphors touches closure image slightly. High info density otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory healing via broken music box in shifting reality transforms pacifist trope organically. Risky poetic surrealism heightens stakes without gimmickry; final self-healing turn inevitable from pattern.</comment>
