<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in shell's promise intensifies to compel playing against statues; embodied emotions like "heart thumping a rhythm" and contradictory fear/reawakening in "would not flee." Final endurance earned via prior orchard risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shell to playing to statues crumbling; RR closure via vine growth reconfigures mechanical world with cost in her defiant stand—"She would not flee."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky-bridge constrains suspended play, orchard statues pressure via flashback anchor; locust shell as recurring object charges final vine image, mirroring internal states through tactile handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reawaken beauty signaled early, escalates accumulatively as statues stir/approach forcing faster play; agency in final chord forecloses stasis with felt wrath cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reawakening emerges from particulars like flower unfurling and vine twining statues; final shell-to-vine image resonantly answers without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musical perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, but minor overwriting edges into opacity under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "resonantly soft" (4x, including final third) and ending loops ("bloomed... sang... laughed") create paraphrase churn, dulling climax propulsion; high figurative density overwrites high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin breaking stone statues in mechanical city via fragile shell-vine; tarnished wonder transforms tropes organically.</comment>
