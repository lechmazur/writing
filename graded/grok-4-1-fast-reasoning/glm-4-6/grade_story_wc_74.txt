<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between insomnia-driven desperation and methodical hope act vividly in the ritual scene; final smile and etched proof earn a meaningful internal reconfiguration with the cost of persistent sleeplessness. Interiority is embodied and particular, rooted in sensory details like the "hum beneath her skin."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from setup deeds to daydream rousing the old man's memory and CR closure via shimmering symbols on the leaf; cost legible in "leaf would crumble by morning, but the act... etched within her." Single scene anchors orientation early; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse constrains ritual with moon-filtered air and plants mirroring growth amid smog; final leaf on windowsill charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (jasmine, damp earth narrowing to saffron quiet) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove kindness's resonance tightens texturally in daydream where buried memory surfaces, forcing realization and symbolic painting; agency via ritual forecloses doubt-path with felt cost of insomnia endurance. Subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of kindness as "lost language" emerges organically from deeds to painted symbols reweighting city indifference; final leaf image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers in fragile proof vs. crumbling leaf.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing (moonlight as "saffron quiet"); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; minor overwriting in metaphors like "syntax of lost languages" purposeful for voice but risks muddle in peak ritual beat. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of insomnia ritual painting memory-symbols transforms kindness trope; moon-brush and leaf script feel inevitable, risking bold conceptual premise without gimmick.</comment>
