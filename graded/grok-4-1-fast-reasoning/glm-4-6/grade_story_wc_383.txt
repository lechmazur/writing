<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's shift from "charmed skeptic" to "practitioner of memory's delicate architecture" is earned through embodied micro-choices like attuning her frequency and arranging crystals, with contradictory impulses (dismissal vs. recognition) acting in the opening shell-cupping beat. Final transformation feels motivated by intensifying whispers and archived memories. No therapy-speak; emotions embodied in "chest tighten" and "ghostly resolve."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers accumulate from fragments to sentences, ritual builds density through crystal activations and garden participation, landing Charged Poise closure as Elena walks the grid, reconfiguring quarantine into wisdom with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in garden/estate/shell. No shards/transitions; single scene coherent. Cost legible in final shell-silence and integrated joy/sorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains choices (flora amplifies resonance) and charges final image (dew-kissed petals, fading star), with sensory details like "silk-textured leaves" and "midnight-blue roses" filtered through Elena's evolving priorities. Twilight-dawn evolution mirrors internal shift. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in crystal placements and barefoot walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive memories for independence) signaled early, escalates via lens with density increase in coherent whispers, sequential activations, and garden's rhythmic trembling narrowing overwhelm risk. Agency in ritual choices forecloses suppression path; cost felt in "beautiful yet weighted with sorrow." One tightening sufficient; closure crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting quarantined sorrow into integrated wisdom emerges organically through shell/garden/memory images, culminating in non-literal "gardening your ghosts" realization that reweights isolation without moralizing. Complexity in love as "refuge and prison"; no tidy binary. Final image offers resonant answer to skeptic's quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature: skeptic's "wind patterns" yields to practitioner's vibrational attunement, diction/rhythm lyrical yet controlled (e.g., "melodic undertone beneath... insects"). Shell "dialogue" natural/subtextual, advances plot. No head-hopping; compression purposeful for ritual beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences like "petals trembled in rhythm" multi-task image/action/atmosphere. Figurative language ("tragically radiant") coherent, pattern-taught via resonance theme, no muddle in peak activations. Rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffolds, or template cadence. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis: resonance-grid archiving via shell/garden transforms memory-quarantine trope into tactile ritual with inevitable "ghosts" payoff. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; no derivative templates. Specifics like calcium chambers ground ingenuity.</comment>
