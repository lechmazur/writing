<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in "tear traced her cheek, silently expressive of both grief and wonder" embodies contradictory emotions under pressure, compelling higher-stakes persistence; final trembling hands reveal values hierarchy with earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as vibrations and scans build density to scanner's "cascade of colors, a symphony of warmth," delivering Charged Poise closure with legible emotional cost from lost sound reconfigured into new harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass panes fog with breath and frame horizon sunset, constraining tactile experiment and charging final image; selective thermal/plant details mirror internal warmth without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping vibrations to plant thermals offers fresh synthesis of deafness and botany, transforming survival trope via specific method that risks failure until scanner cascade inevitability.</comment>
