<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reckless idealist embodied in gentle-yet-defiant descent and ritual care with bones/roots; micro-choices like tracing silver reveal values under pressure. Earned change via soul-stitching with felt cost of shared memories. Minor label-speak in "reckless idealist" opening doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to ritual glow-flare, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) via fruit emergence and soul-patch, with binding cost legible in "roots tightened around his wrist." Orientation anchored early in corridors/orchard; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard pulses with roots/bones constraining altar ritual and binding wrist, charging final fruit image. Sensory details (damp earth, sweeter perfume, rattling bones) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix tattered soul via barter) signaled early, escalates texturally via root-shift/vision/binding under lens, narrowing to trade-off with memory sting cost. Agency in invocation forces crystallization; one deepening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutual soul-patching emerges organically from ritual exchange, resolved non-literally in star-fruit and emergent stars reweighting "claim destiny" premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "balance, a peace."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (walls as braille, roots pulsing); voice modulates rhythmically from dusky descent to humming intent. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in whispers; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: silver-glow sequence layers action/image without loops. Purposeful "glow" recurrence textural, not artifact; rhythm varies for ritual peak, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb-orchard ritual bartering tarot-destiny into fruit/soul-stitch transforms tropes organically. Risky dusky mysticism heightens stakes via binding cost, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
