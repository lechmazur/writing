<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find story beginnings is consistent and intensifies through customer interactions, culminating in earned acceptance of his role as endings' keeper. Interiority concrete in actions like tracing palms and shrugging off regret. Customers feel archetypal but reveal under pressure via trembling hands and hesitant nods; no deep contradictions shown in pivotal incisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of two customers builds density toward CR closure in Elias's satisfaction despite unfulfilled quest, with conceptual cost legible in "keeper of their endings." Orientation anchored early in shop setup. One tightening via second customer's mirroring deepens stakes without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard library and swirling clouds vividly constrain silence (footsteps silent on glass floor) and charge final image of swirling clouds mirroring fragmented reflections. Sensory details (humming books, whisper of clouds) filtered through Elias's priorities, evolving with lull. Micro-setting of counter and shelves guides incisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bottling absence for clean slates) signaled early; accumulative escalation via repeated incisions narrows Elias's options to acceptance, with felt cost in captured story wisps. Protagonist agency in swift work and placements; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at "clean slate untroubled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of untethered stories emerges organically from incisions and bottled essences, reweighted in final CR: beginnings unpursued, endings embraced without moralizing. Resonant image of gleaming constellation of lost chances answers quest non-literally. Subtext in silences and shrugs avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (noting trembling hands, scattered gazes). Voice modulates poetically with fragmentation fitting tone, diction controlled. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Regret is just another story"), advances via trades.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short incisive beats amid lyrical swells; high density in incisions. Minor loops in "fragmented like" and "swirling" (clouds thrice), but purposeful for texture; no closure dulling. Varied syntax propels lull to chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory excision as moonlight bottling transforms trope of forgetting into story-currency economy. Risky floating library premise commits fully, with incisions earning hindsight inevitability. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
