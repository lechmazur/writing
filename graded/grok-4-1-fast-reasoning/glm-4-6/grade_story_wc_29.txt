<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots clearly in her unique interpretation and isolation, compelling the interference choice with career risk as felt cost; interiority shows via chart-tracing under pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting 9+; resolute competence lacks blind spots compounding before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal analysis → vulnerability discovery → interference at 2:17 AM yields DC closure with legible cost (funding/career risk) in final monitoring beat. Single scene oriented early; one tightening suffices. Closure cost evident in "risking the facility's funding and her career."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dim control room, headphones, and charts anchor vividly and constrain (tracing reveals vulnerability, guides interference). Sensory hierarchy fits expertise (glow on charts). Final silence recharges room as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interfere undetected) signals early, tightens via frequency vulnerability to agency-driven test; cost (trace risk, isolation) visible, alters tactics. Escalation causal under lens; no reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation vs. evidence emerges organically from signal interpretation and community divisions, resonating in final "celestial silence" reweighting cosmic suggestions. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in persistent beliefs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (astronomical patterns, subsonic tech); diction controlled but expository stretches dilute under stress. No dialogue; elision minimal and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in signal backstory ("patterns... too perfect, too responsive") and repetitive "astronomical charts" dull density (-0.6); rhythm varies but telling summaries pad momentum. Propulsion clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic tricksters outwitted via subsonic jam transforms alien trope through grounded expertise; risk in undetected interference heightens stakes organically.</comment>
