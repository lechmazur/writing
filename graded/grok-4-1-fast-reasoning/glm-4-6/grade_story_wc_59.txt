<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to reawaken beauty roots choices consistently, culminating in earned sacrifice at "Kael fell to his knees" as palace falls. Interiority concrete in tactile egg-handling but slips into unembodied epiphanies like "his motivation was singular." Contradictory impulses (tinkering vs. betrayal) show in trembling hands, but emotions lean performed over fully contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from tinkering to "the thread tightened around the egg, cracking it open" for CR closure with legible cost in plummeting palace and Kael's death. Orientation anchored early in palace description; single scene causality links assembly to hatching via whirring/gears. No orientation debt; minor redundancy in hypotheses doesn't break drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "crystalline floors vibrating" and "stalactite anchors groaned" constrain climax choices and charge final fall image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile grease, humming wires) reflects Kael's tinkering bias; evolves causally with quaking. Micro-setting (egg/device) mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via palace's intensifying "scream" to force stance crystallization in hatching. Agency in placing egg forecloses mechanical world with visible cost at anchors snapping. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of undoing flawed genesis emerges organically via egg-seed rebirth contrasting mechanical prison, reweighted in bird's song as "world remade." Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing; ambiguity in "what if they meant to die beautifully?" invites reflection. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in hypothesis-whispers and tinkering lexicon; rhythm modulates from reverie to crescendo urgency. Prose texture distinct in poetic compounds like "quaking reverie"; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in device assembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like "copper wires hummed, and the tangled thread began to unwind"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in repeated "painfully sweet" patterns and metaphor density ("wings spanning the cavern like a cathedral's arches") borders muddle but ties to tone. No loops obscuring closure; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical cavern-world undone by organic egg-seed rebirth; tropes like lost paradise transformed via prince's hypothesis-driven risk. Bold tonal risk in "quaking reverie" repetition heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from assembly to fall.</comment>
