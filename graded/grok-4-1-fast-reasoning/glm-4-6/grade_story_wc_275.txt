<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in knife-sheathing ritual and soil-stained hands vs father's calluses; endurance of pacifism earned via daily choices. Minor slip in idealized perception without on-page struggle costing a micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in glowing roses and retreat despite world news; cost felt in isolation. Weak tightening—no reversal narrows options beyond reflective deepening; vignette structure functional but static past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dome's glass etchings and wind-as-gunfire constrain perception and charge final sanctuary image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (rose tilts, resin scent); no object charges a choice but micro-setting lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace vs violence) signaled but abstract—no on-page test, reversal, or agency foreclosing path under lens. No escalation or visible price alters tactics; internal tension static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of creation-from-chaos emerges organically via sheathed knife shifting to glowing roses; resonant non-literal close reweights inheritance. Caps at 7.2 per Q4 pressure limit; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in plant frequencies and glass resonances; rhythmic modulation apt for lyric build. Caps at 7.6 per Q7 debt; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("violent profession" x2 exact, "tower fell/collapse" churn) dull density; template echoes in ritual descriptions. Rhythmic variety supports but artifacts touch reflective beats; −1.1 total.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant inculcation and post-tower dome transforms pacifist trope; knife-velvet and glowing blooms inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk heightens quiet stakes.</comment>
