<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied pain from tessera's edges grounds her retrocognitive curse in micro-choices; contradictory gentle/unyielding impulses act simultaneously in renaming act, earning endurance with felt cost of endless task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as renaming density reconfigures ruins; closure CR lands on-page in "plaza... no longer a graveyard, but a garden waiting," with conceptual cost of perpetual work legible in final kneeling/whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone's "chipped patterns" and "void where a lion’s mane had roared" constrain her tactile renaming and charge final garden image; shattered sky evolves causally from fractured to less so.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing via renaming signaled early tightens via first tessera placement causing world shift, forcing endurance; agency in pressing/renaming forecloses grief-language path with cost of looped curse felt throughout.</comment>
