<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and embodied in ritual actions, with patience as consistent trait driving micro-choices like tweezers sorting; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper conflict. Inherited drive feels earned without epiphany. Final endurance in sealing shows credible continuity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pattern-setting to starlight pouring, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) via luminous map creation; cost legible in "preserving not just copper and starlight but the continuity of knowledge." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subarctic crater and withered orchard constrain choices (winds challenge steady hands, tree resin seals); recurring glass fragments and apple tree charge final image. Sensory details (perpetual twilight, skeletal branches) filter through alchemical POV. Environment evolves with ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful map creation) signaled early, tightens via starlight's sentient spread responding to heartbeat; agency in precise pouring/tipping forecloses failure path. Accumulative escalation via resonance chamber; cost felt in physical patience under winds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of alchemical preservation emerges organically from patterns translating ephemera to permanence; final sealing image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "withered orchard not an ending but a beginning." Subtext in heartbeat-as-tuning-fork avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with alchemical perceptual signature (e.g., "resonated at the right frequency"); rhythmic prose modulates with ritual intensity. No dialogue; diction purposeful and biased toward cartographic metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., starlight pour advances plot, character, atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation fits voice; closure image propels cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual in subarctic limbo transforms tropes (forgotten worlds, captured light) via heartbeat maps; risk in abstract physics paid off in tangible sealing. Inevitable hindsight from generational inheritance.</comment>
