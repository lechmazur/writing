<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover trees' witnessing drives consistent secretive actions, intensifying through balanced duties and research. Interiority concrete in notebook documentation and trembling hands, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discovery density builds to CR closure; "the sextant began to pulse... golden threads connecting the tower to the distant tree" reconfigures premise with felt cost in trembling hands. Orientation anchored early in corridors; shards taught via research pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth corridors, stormlit tower, and silhouetted tree constrain choices and charge CR image, with moonlight enabling sextant healing. Sensory details selective via POV priorities, mirroring emotional absorption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tree-discovery signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sextant repairs, dream-mapping to tower revelation narrowing knowledge. Protagonist agency in adjustments forces CR; cost legible in worldview shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-as-growth emerges organically from particulars like liquid light and growth rings, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer to witnessing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature blending maintenance pragmatism and wonder; rhythmic prose modulates purposefully from hush to stormlit pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated images like "columns of liquid light"; minor figurative density in climax metaphors consistent with magical realism, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sextant quantifying sorrow into tree memories synthesizes fresh magical realism angle, transforming tropes via irreplaceable research logic; revelation feels inevitable from early discovery.</comment>
