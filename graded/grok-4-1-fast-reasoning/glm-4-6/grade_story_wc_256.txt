<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via vibrations up spine and embodied smile; motivation intensifies to earned inward shift. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with questions feeling diagnostic rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from whispers to lab hum; closure as CR in "artificial pilgrimage had revealed itself as a journey inward, not outward" with conceptual cost of redefining search as creation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like fractured glow and shivering instruments filter through sonic POV; carbide lens as micro-setting constrains stepping choice and charges dimming finale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens texturally via fork strike narrowing to inward propulsion; agency in micro-choices forecloses outward path with felt resonance cost at "journey inward".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection in silence/resonance emerges via merging light/sound; final image reweights particulars without moral, though "resonance we choose to share" borders on echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with vibration-biased perception stable; rhythmic modulation peaks at "cascade of harmonics" without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath, high density in images; minor loops in "powerfully gentle" repeats and shadow recurrences dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh sonic pilgrimage premise risks lyric synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via lens-fork-lab crescendo transforming absence to symphony.</comment>
