<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation intensifies compellingly to the trembling-hands activation, rooted in consistent resourcefulness; embodied resolve under unraveling plans earns endurance. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from puddle map to key insertion to 90-second broadcast DC; alarms and escape provide legible cost in final lines, reconfiguring stakes without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Puddle reflections constrain navigation choices early, auric lagoon's glow charges final image of shimmering memories; sensory filter (ripples, golden hue) mirrors POV urgency without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth vs erasure) tightens via Jenna's miss forcing contingency broadcast; agency in menu navigation forecloses defection path with alarm cost on-page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in integrated sensory/action lines; minor paraphrase loop in "plans unravelled" repeats dulls one beat, but propulsion holds through varied syntax to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-map comms and defunct phone net transforms revisionist trope; risk in obsolete-tech climax heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
