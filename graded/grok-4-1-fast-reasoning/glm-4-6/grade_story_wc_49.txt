<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ancestral songs and years of study compels precise micro-choices like gear adjustment; embodied tears at closure earn release. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in vine blooming and lingering song; cost legible in "weight of his purpose lifted" and tears. Orientation anchors immediately; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine tendril and moon-pooled light constrain placement of cricket and charge final blooming image. Sensory details (rustled leaves, metallic chirp) filter through Elias's whimsical priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore practices tightens accumulatively as chirps grow and vine responds; agency in "Sing" urging forecloses failure with emotional cost in kneeling. Minor abstract stakes declaration early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of craft reviving lost magic emerges from particulars like cricket mimicking ancestral songs; final dawn-woven hymn reweights forgetting without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in lingering song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with whimsical perceptual signature (world holding breath, arbor listening); rhythmic prose modulates to reverent stillness at peak. Whispers carry subtext of anticipation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure build ("light weaving," "pulsing rhythm" in most sentences); minor paraphrase loops on "gathering hush" and "song" dull propulsion slightly. Rhythmic variation strong otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer magic and automaton folklore transformed via song-vine mechanics; poetic risk heightens restoration stakes organically.</comment>
