<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. resolve over chime repair) act in scene; final memory sacrifice earned by prior foxglove regret motif with visible emotional cost, embodied in "felt a little emptier, a little more alone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chime crack to locket sacrifice; CR closure in final image of endless burden reconfigures preservation stake with conceptual cost ("how long could one person hold the weight of so many ghosts?").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal library and glass-orchids constrain choices (orchids dim without chime balance) and charge final image (orchids hum steady as stars); sensory hierarchy (hums, glows) reflects caretaker's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation) signaled early, tightens via personal memory cost after chime repair; agency in humming escalates under Accumulative lens, cost unmistakable in "a little emptier."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's endless cost emerges from particulars (orchid names, sacrificed memory); final image offers resonant answer ("heart beating in time with the echoes of a world long gone") reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (notices hums, glows, fractures); rhythmic control heightens lyrical pressure, elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor overwrite density in peak repair beat ("voice threading... spun sugar"; "fissure closing inch by inch") slightly muddles without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic artifacts and memory-sacrifice transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via song motif.</comment>
