<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orion's jocular mask cracks authentically under the old woman's insight and cupola realization, earning the final endurance with embodied contradiction ("tightly at a curling tendril" vs. "genuine hope piercing cynicism"). Flawless micro-choices reveal values; backstory anchors present quest without drag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in cupola ("small, resonant world of sound" reweights external quest with barter cost of moon rock). Orientation anchors by para 2; single-shard ascent transition tightens to charged poise without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy and rust constrain ascent choice and mirror isolation, charging final sound symphony; sensory hierarchy (rustle, hum, heart) narrows under realization. Cupola dome integrates tactilely, evolving causally from platform.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant loneliness stake deepens via rock exchange and climb, reweighting options under Accum lens with one decisive internalization; cost legible in foreclosed external cure ("visitor, not resident"). Agency in pursuit/endurance tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from barter/plaque "Listen," culminating in non-literal CR repricing loneliness without moralizing; final laugh recharges rumor chain with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual bias (logistican's chaos/deference) modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtextual ("catalyze" evades directness). Prose diction reflects polite anarchy idiom consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops/artifacts dull peak cupola image ("symphony of sounds he'd been tuning out"). Metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Moon rock barter transforms quest trope into internal reciprocity via rumor/station frame; quiet CR ending risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight without derivative hedging.</comment>
