<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal portal entry; interiority concrete but leans abstract/poetic without embodied flaws driving struggle. Sanely eccentric trait more label than complicating micro-choices. Earned change feels declarative rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build to hyperbolic shift and portal; CR closure in library pulsing/reconfigured with felt cost of unraveling self-integration. Orientation anchored early in midnight library. No disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hyperbolic shelves curving/aisles folding constrain path to door, mirroring internal quest; scarf as micro-setting charges final humming image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific to poetic geometry. Purposeful selection over breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stories' place tightens accumulatively via geometry hum to unraveling bridge, narrowing to reawakening with cost of dissolution/reweaving. Agency in stepping through forces reconfiguration. Cost legible in scarf's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of living stories emerges organically from geometric particulars, not statement; final scarf/library image reweights analog premise with conceptual cost of infinite fluidity. Resists tidy moral via lingering journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of syntax equations/rhythms; voice texture poetic/rhythmic modulates intensity. Capped by Q7 debt. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Repetitive "sanely eccentric" (3x) and "patrons browsed/oblivious" loops create paraphrase churn; minor synonym cycling on "stories lived/pulsed/breathed." Figuratives coherent but dense in peak without full propulsion. Rhythm varies but template stems in descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as poetic language transforms library trope organically; risk-taking in spatial dissolution heightens stakes to CR closure without gimmick.</comment>
