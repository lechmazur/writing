<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits like contralto voice and maternal care for mechanisms, compelling her calibration and broadcast; interiority concrete in humming and finger adjustments. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with success feeling unresisted. No earned change beyond endurance of her project, mostly affirmative traits without flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from preparation to broadcast responses, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) via new agreements and festivals as legible before/after with felt cost of 15-year isolation bridged. Orientation anchored early in tower ascent. One tightening via midnight strike to reciprocal signals suffices; cost legible in "return the cuckoo clock weight... recording every response."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: pendular swing, brass horn, starlight through dials constrain calibration choices and charge final descent image. POV bias filters via librarian priorities (archives to multilingual folk tales). Spatial choreography coherent in spiral staircase and interior mechanisms; no white-room, details evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate connections) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via calibration to responses across counties under lens. Agency in decisive adjustments and programming forces trade-off of solitary nights for communal revival. Visible cost in 15-year origin and nightly toil, but lacks reversal narrowing options beyond smooth success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of voices bridging isolation emerges organically from interspersed languages and silo responses, reweighted in multilingual charter without statement. Final image (heart in "vigorous tender rhythm") offers non-literal resonance to connection question. Subtext in gentle vigor avoids tidy moral; complexity in immigrant histories lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in choral metaphors and multilingual flow; rhythmic syntax modulates from preparation hush to broadcast vigor. Single broadcast line natural and goal-driven ("Добрий вечір"), advancing plot. No head-hopping; diction controlled, voice-modulated under success pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "empathetically decisive fingers adjusted" advances action/character); rhythm varies read-aloud. Paraphrase loops on "vigorous tender" and "construct bridges from silos" dull momentum (−0.6); minor synonym churn in qualities, but no closure touch. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian reviving whistling codes via clock tower broadcasts transforms tropes organically; "whiskundi" and Ukrainian opener feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in surreal prairie-silo mechanics heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, bold premise commits fully.</comment>
