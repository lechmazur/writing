<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's consistent motivation to aid earthbound echoes drives his painstaking climax untangling, embodied in tracing threads and feeling warmth; blithe traits contrast effectively with solemn work. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the decoding beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: setup notices fraying → deepening isolates/decodes Foster thread → cadence shift reconstitutes it with "warmth" payoff. Closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in seamless thread and persistent "more echoes" cost image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's circular chamber, work table constellations, and tapestry constrain decoding choices and charge final locking with moonlight. Sensory velveteen gloom evolves tactilely from oppressive to softer, mirroring resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fraying echoes tightens texturally via specific Foster thread deepening, narrowing to unfulfilled promise; agency in tweezers/lens work forecloses malignancy with felt warmth cost. No full 9+ as cost leans conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of intentional lingering emerges organically from decoding histories, resonating in final "by choice, not misunderstanding" without moralizing. Closing image reweights tapestry border as repository of unfinished stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in metaphysical noticing (threads pulsing urgency); voice texture modulates poetically yet controlled. Whisper echoes carry subtext without on-page dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action/metaphor, rhythm varies for calm escalation; minor overwriting in thread descriptions ("stormy blue... stubborn resistance") borders mixed vehicles without closure harm. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Soul-tapestry cartography transforms ghost tropes via decoding intentions, with fraying border as fresh causal engine; risk in metaphysical lab coheres boldly to charged closure.</comment>
