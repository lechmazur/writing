<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to map walls' dreams intensifies through embodied visions flooding his mind upon touching the wall, earning the shift to feeling "chosen" with the cost of potential ruin; interiority particular via bone-shivers and heart-pounding without stock epiphanies. Contradictory impulses subtle in hesitation before reaching out again.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density builds to CR closure in final realization that legacy is "direction," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of joining wall-ghosts; on-page negative-to-vision progression anchors causality cleanly. Orientation immediate in opening trudge through passage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled walls and slick tendrils constrain choices by pulsing/hiding cracks that prompt pauses and touches, charging final image of ivy leaning in; sensory selection (crunching leaves, damp cold) reflects perceptual bias post-shifts. Hearth ashes supply negative, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wall dreams) signaled early tightens texturally via negative glimpse to mind-flood reversal, narrowing to endurance with cost of "sensitive perception... to the point of ruin"; agency in repeated wall-touch forecloses ignorance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Legacy's burden emerges organically from woman's trapped joy/despair visions, resonant CR in "legacy’s burden was not weight—he was direction" reweighting without statement; ambiguity in mercy vs. prison lingers via walls waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "corridors held ghosts" bias and rhythmic modulation (short stumbles amid lyrical swells); no head-hopping, diction controlled to character's quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied lengths and sensory propulsion (e.g., "ivy rustling like distant applause"), high density in vision beat; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("coiled like a snake... fluttered in his mind’s eye") but coherent and pattern-taught without loop or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate echo-cartography transforms ghost-story tropes via walls storing memories like "jars of preserves," risk in lyric perceptions heightens stakes inevitably to CR; no derivative echoes.</comment>
