<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—clutching fading photos while driven to destroy the fragment—act in scene, culminating in hesitation at the tree where her face flickers, earning the final erasure with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pulsing bridges to writhing paths and quaking reverie, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in the dissolving maze and "utterly, beautifully empty" ruins with conceptual cost of void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry and living bridges constrain choices, twisting paths and forming the staircase; they charge the final image as bridges "disintegrating into petals," mirroring internal collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to sever past escalates via accumulative density (fragment searing, garden shuddering), forcing agency in raising the fragment; cost unmistakable in lost wife and "ruins of his design."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time's tangled knot emerges organically through particulars like curling photo edges and collapsing geometry; final image resonant reconfiguration reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in hyperbolic noticing ("paths folding back on themselves"); rhythmic control heightens pressure, as in fragment's buzz modulating to searing heat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "horizon bending like a mirage" integrate action; no loops or artifacts, varied rhythm supports quaking reverie without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze as fractured mind, halo fragments as heaven slivers, and time's texture transforms tropes; risk in hyperbolic living architecture heightens stakes to inevitable empty closure.</comment>
