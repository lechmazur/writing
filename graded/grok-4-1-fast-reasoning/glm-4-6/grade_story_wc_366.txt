<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between reticence and warm observance shown in noticing envelope's details and slipping sea glass into pocket; micro-choices like stacking stones earn slight change with felt cost of lingering longing. Emotions embodied via sea glass warming, but occasional abstract phrasing like "luminescent ache" softens peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of tokens (letters, sea glass, stones) building to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early in docking scene. Sea glass placement and stone stacking reconfigure solitude into quiet connection with undeniable emotional cost in "pang of longing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sea glass as recurring micro-setting constrains final offering on windowsill, charging closure image with aquamarine scatter; sensory details like "saltwater scent" and "heavy air" filter through Jonah's observant bias. Lantern room subtly pressures emotional ascent without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety deepens texturally via letter reflections narrowing to present realization of writer's presence; one tightening in wick igniting forces endurance of loneliness. Cost legible in "weight...lifted ever so slightly," but internal pressure lacks sharper external test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of silent connection emerges organically from token exchanges, reweighted in final stone triangle as non-literal answer to yearning; ambiguity lingers in unseen writer. Sea glass image resists tidy moral, embracing luminescent ache's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in selective details like "ink’s faint saltwater scent"; rhythmic prose modulates from heavy sorrow to sighing relief. No head-hopping; voice coheres as reticent yet observant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated details, but minor paraphrase loops in "letters had taught him" repetitions dull mid-beats; rhythm varies with shorter sentences at flame ignition. No heavy artifacts touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse tropes via object dialogue (stones, glass) transforming reticence; stone triangle as final inflection grows from letter chain without late rules. Bold quiet risk heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
