<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation to pursue knowledge drives consistent choices, but interiority leans diagnostic in bathroom breakthroughs ("philosophical breakthrough"), lacking embodied contradiction until final acceptance; change to brightened disquiet feels earned but lacks scene-acting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mosaic shards of orchard/bathroom visits taught early via nonlinear inheritance pattern; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cadence shift to CR closure ("nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or a gift but simply complicated existence"), cost legible in acceptance of disquiet and passing the cameo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Astral orchard and cameo shell provide vivid, selective sensory anchors (iridescent glow, crystalline fruits) filtered through Margaret's bewilderment; micro-settings constrain access/knowledge and charge final desk image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forbidden knowledge pursuit signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations (notes rewriting, orchard visitors) narrowing to successor responsibility; cost felt in blurred realities foreclosing linear existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear gaps emerges organically from orchard fruits and rewriting notes; final CR image ("cameo shell would remain both empty and full") offers resonant reweighting of inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of philosophical drift matches nonlinear texture; purposeful repetition ("simply complicated") taught as voice motif, rhythmic control sustains under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic phrasing, but minor paraphrase loops in revelation summaries ("philosophical breakthroughs"); rhythm varies effectively, no scaffold dulling closure image of desk/note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pistachio cameo unlocking timeline orchard synthesizes fresh esoteric conceit with lived curator detail; risk-taking nonlinear shards heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via orchard's inner curvature reveal.</comment>
