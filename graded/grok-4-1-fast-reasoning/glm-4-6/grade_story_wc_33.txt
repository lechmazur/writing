<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in brother's silence intensely compels the smuggling choice, with frantic heart revealing embodied contradiction under drone pressure. Interiority particular through "linking absences," avoiding stock phrases. Minor label-speak in "respectfully rebellious" slightly abstracts without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shuttle docking → EMP during drone zenith → blind spot hides book → shuttle glides with hope. Closure as Charged Poise in "lay a single stone on that phantom road," reconfiguring quest with felt cost of "not today." Orientation anchored early in arcade; no slips touch pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's "neon ghosts" and twilight hush constrain waiting as neutral confessional, mirroring absences. Bottle as micro-setting enables targeted EMP choice. Final "twilight deepened" charges closure image, filtering through Kael's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to smuggle tissue via absence signaled early, tightening at drone zenith forces EMP trade-off with heart-frantic risk. Agency in thumbing cap narrows options; cost legible in "energy spent" and system-logged surge complicating future drops. Escalation causal, no abstractions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges via linking brother's silence to family's tissue sample, without statement. Final "one carefully orchestrated omission" reweights absences as hope's road, resonant non-literal answer with ongoing cost. Particulars drive irony of voids carrying life.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in absences and silences; voice lyrical yet concrete, modulating rhythm at "silent crackle of violet energy." No elision or head-hopping; diction fits heretic mailman's poetic quest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in "three seconds, every sensor... fizzed into static," propelling climax without loops or scaffolds. Rhythms vary, metaphors purposeful ("thunderstorm in a bottle") without muddle in peak EMP beat. Minor overwriting in opening neon ghosts elevates texture without obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of mailman smuggling via engineered absences and contained EMP transforms tropes organically. Method's "negative space" feels inevitable from setup, risking bold rule-break without gimmick. Fresh premise commits fully, heightening stakes through irreplaceable bottle.</comment>
