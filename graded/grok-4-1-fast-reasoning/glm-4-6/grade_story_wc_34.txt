<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in articulating needs, embodied in precise brushstrokes under storm pressure; final purpose realization earned via prior wandering cue. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build in encoding process; Charged Poise closure in completed graffiti and descent reconfigures purpose with legible cost of closing storm window ("Thunder rumbled... his window... would soon close"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and storm constrain choices (work between flashes, precarious perch) and charge final image of concealed art; sensory details (luminescent ink, warm plate) filtered through POV, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timely encoding signaled early, tightens via frantic pace as thunder nears under accumulative lens; agency in creation forecloses path with felt cost of retreat, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bridging realms emerges organically from particulars like shifting symbols and graffiti; final humming ballad offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in lightning, breathing symbols); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation under pressure enhances drifting alertness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; purposeful repetition of lightning/mist builds texture without loops. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs ("weathered features/hands") slightly dulls peak frantic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ethereal ghost, graffiti encoding, and storm perch transforms tropes; risk-taking in poetic causality feels inevitable, heightening stakes.</comment>
