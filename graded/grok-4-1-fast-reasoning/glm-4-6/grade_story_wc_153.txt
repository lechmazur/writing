<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation meticulously rooted in regret's fork, with micro-choices like crouching on roots and holding shard aloft earning release; interiority concrete via trembling fingers touching words, though lacks deeper contradictory impulses in peak evocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from faint pulse to cascading words and crescendo, yielding Charged Poise closure ("words dissolved... peace") with legible cost in mourned "love that had almost been"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove roots and dappled moonlight constrain choices (insufficient light forces deeper steps) and charge final harmony image; sensory hierarchy (salt-laced air, waxy leaves) filters through medium's mystical bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke apology) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shard warming, words forming, and spirits' crescendo narrowing to moonlight healing; agency in stepping deeper forecloses limbo with felt cost of silence's ache resolved on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges organically from particulars like condensation apologies shifting to release; final image ("labyrinth hummed with... release") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence's prison without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (liminal spaces "stitched into... what could have been"); rhythmic prose modulates from humid whisper to soaring crescendo, diction purposeful and voice-motivated without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "shard began to pulse faintly... warming against her palm" advancing texture and propulsion; purposeful "singing spirits" repetition teaches pattern without loop, though minor synonym churn in "fierce tenderness" dings slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gargoyle shard as threshold guardian healing unsent regrets in spirit-haunted mangroves feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens mystical stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
