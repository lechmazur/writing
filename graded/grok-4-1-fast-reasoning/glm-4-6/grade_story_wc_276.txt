<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cool-headed exterior contradicts raw soul poured into ritual, with contradictory impulses acting in the zigzag etching; final endurance integrates echo as personal burden with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from restive garden/sky to faltering hum and slowed stars; RR closure lands in "tremor, not of sound, but of pure feeling," reconfiguring cosmos with fisher's longing as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rail spike as micro-setting anchors reality against hum, constraining zigzag action; garden's drooping/reopening charges final image, mirroring internal states through causal response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to catch echo tightens via ritual deepening, narrowing to soul-baring trade-off; cost legible in spike's warm vibration and "burden both a treasure and a sorrow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-as-net emerges organically from transliteration ritual; final pocketed spike offers resonant answer to longing, reweighting isolation with divine integration sans moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in empathic noticing (e.g., "feeling shaped into emptiness"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "feral lullaby," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via concrete images like "sliced through the humming buds"; varied rhythm and no loops/artifacts sustain propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-voicing to catch goddess echo grounds abstract premise in tactile ritual; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
