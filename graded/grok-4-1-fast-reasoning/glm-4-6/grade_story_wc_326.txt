<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to help Aris defragment roots in survival guilt, embodied via rising heartbeats that contradict his calm facade during ink patterns. Internal conflict emerges in tapping the shard to disrupt, revealing tension between control and surrender. Aris as secondary applies pressure through transmitted memories, forcing Elias's endurance; closure earns peace without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns accumulate density from constellations to spiral galaxy, reweighting failure as wisdom in CR closure ("survival itself is the wisdom"). Orientation anchors early (Elias at opal doors); single scene causality via shard taps and transmissions tightens to charged poise. Cost legible in final heartbeat sync with Aris's "infinite."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opal facade and snow blanket constrain isolation, mirroring internal solace; ink desk carvings and porcelain shard as micro-settings charge choices (tapping disrupts patterns). Sensory hierarchy via Elias: visual ink swirls dominate under stress, voice in nerve intimate. Final snow whispering approval recharges setting to deepen CR.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defragment for wisdom from failure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as ink forms haunting pulse image then question mark, narrowing to spiral realization. Heartbeat rise (72 to 81) forces micro-choice (tap shard), with agency in endurance; cost felt in accepting miscalculation's legacy, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in breakage emerges via ink failures turning to galaxy, heartbeat constancy, and shard gleam; subtext in Aris's "count my heartbeats too" layers survival's irony without statement. Final CR reweights premise—failure preserves—with emotional cost in peace over answers, resonant and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias (heartbeats, ink as data); voice texture lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in patterns ("ink swirled into constellations"). Dialogue subtextual—Aris's transmissions pursue memory recovery, distinct from Elias's whispers; no head-hopping, elision taught via implant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in heartbeat spikes, flowing in ink descriptions); high density integrates action/atmosphere without loops, though minor synonym churn in "snow" motifs purposeful. No scaffold; final line recharges motifs propulsively. Figuratives coherent, no muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost defragment via ink patterns transforms ghost-story trope into textured communion; porcelain shard from watch evolves uniquely to disrupt/reprise. Risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight from accident anchor.</comment>
