<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses shine when anger darkens the stem but she redirects via neuroreorganization, earning the calm harvest and replanting as a meaningful change with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying growth density from planting to sprouts; closure as Charged Poise in twenty specialized plants reconfigures rebellion with discipline's felt cost, anchored early in greenhouse and seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse's glass ceiling channels cosmic singing energy to constrain alignment-timed growth, charging final sprouts amid ruins; sensory details like pulsing seed warmth filter through Elara's tasting bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of imprinting hope tightens accumulatively through emotional responses narrowing to pruning trade-off; agency in synaptic choices forecloses bitterness path, with cost legible in trembling-yet-calm hands at harvest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet growth from brokenness emerges via fruit's embedded memories, final replanting image resonantly reweighting ruins without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in memory-tasting (grandmother's cinnamon evokes bronze leaves); voice modulates rhythmically from musing whispers to calm intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like pruning cuts dissolving into light; varied rhythm and strong verbs avoid loops, though minor lyrical elevation in "mind became a garden" risks slight overwrit but serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef, synaptic planting, and cosmic-post-apoc rebellion transforms tropes organically; risk in neuroplasticity mechanics heightens stakes inevitably to sprout multiplicity.</comment>
