<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-teller forced to embrace impossibility) act in scene via lattice micro-choice and wall permeation; final escape renunciation of disbelief earned by backstory anchors with visible isolation cost. Interiority concrete via metallic tang and salt-regret senses. No safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: decipher-scuffs → unscrew-lattice → shimmer-belief → wall-yield DC with cost (disbelief foreclosed, warden footsteps). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elias, cell door, sunset). Single scene, no shards; lens holds to closure image of beacon threading destiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reef crashes, wind howl constrain escape choreography; lattice holes as micro-setting enable scuff-map discovery, charging final permeation. Sensory hierarchy (copperlight narrowing to shimmer) reflects urgency. Jagged reef mirrors internal labyrinth without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape before bodies/warden) signaled early, tightens via timed lattice peer (options narrow to belief-act). Agency in permeation forecloses cell-path with footsteps cost. Escalation causal under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (lies-to-truth via belief) emerges from wolf-son stakes, wall-as-doorway; final beacon image reweights premise non-literally (stories believed because real). Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (scuff-patterns through lattice bias). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short permeation sentences). No dialogue; voice diction (hush, thread) consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "copperlight deepened to bruised purple" advances time/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor patterned repetition ("narrow door left ajar") taught early as motif, not loop; no scaffold in peak permeation. Zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh wolf-son inversion (disbelieved truth forces belief-magic); confessional-map ingenuity transforms tropes organically. Risky impossibility sustains closure without late rules; inevitable in hindsight via scratches.</comment>
