<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's embodied tears and trembling hands at the music box reveal contradictory wistfulness driving purpose shift; final endurance as keeper earned by prior ritual causality with cost of past unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: music box discovery breaks pattern and tightens density toward RR/Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "gleaned redemption" realization foreclosing purposelessness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Feral loft constrains evolution from shelter to repository, mirroring internal lonesome splendor; dunes and jars charge final winding image, filtering through Silas's sound-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant purpose stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively via music box and woman's visit narrowing options; agency in jar-capturing forces trade-off with felt relational cost at recognition moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Preservation theme emerges organically from jar ritual and generational relay; final image of winding box offers non-literal reconfiguration of memory's erosion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature on sounds; voice rhythm modulates wistfully, woman's whisper carries subtext without on-page dialogue excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety in dawn descriptions, but paraphrase loops in purpose summaries ("translator between generations") and repeated "dawn's earliest whistle" dull mid-section density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jars-for-sounds premise ingeniously synthesizes vagrant poet with memory preservation; generational translation turn feels inevitable from music box pivot without trope hedging.</comment>
