<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's meticulous traits and internal conflict between caution and curiosity drive the pivotal choice against the wall, with embodied shiver and steady breathing showing contradiction under pressure. Minor label-like phrasing ("credibly curious") slightly abstracts embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer to charged poise closure ("made his choice" amid rain), with legible cost in overcome hesitation; single scene oriented immediately in courtyard. No micro turns dilute; pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard stones ("cool against his back") and quarantine haze constrain solitude and charge final image, with sensory selection (scent of parchment, rustling leaves) filtered through Elias's priorities. Weather (raindrops) evolves to affect resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. rogue pull) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via note ("Trust the rogue"), forcing stance crystallization with felt unease cost. One tightening suffices for length, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in chaos emerges implicitly through tube/note and final tempest image, reweighting premise without statement; ambiguity lingers in "some truths" realization. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (lateral mental mapping) modulates rhythm under rising unease; no dialogue or head-hopping. Prose texture matches meticulous mind without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("progressing laterally" twice) and repetitive stems ("his...mind") create template cadence in reflective beats, dulling density slightly; rhythm varies otherwise with strong propulsion to rain closure. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quarantine rebels, pigeon relic, and lateral storm-recording transforms tropes organically; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars without hedging.</comment>
