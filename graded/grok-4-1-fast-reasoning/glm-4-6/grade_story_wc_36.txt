<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via trembling hands and embodied burden, with contradictory fear/determination driving micro-choices like precise driftwood placement; earned change in realization about rigidity vs. flow shows flaws complicating resolution without tidy epiphany. Minor abstract phrasing like "weight of that failure" dilutes embodiment slightly, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from arrangement to flute-playing to realm traversal, culminating in on-page CR (burden shifts to "manageable mass") with felt cost in painful memory admission; orientation anchored early via canyon and post-guardianship context; single tightening via veil-thinning suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range as echo chamber constrains flute ritual; driftwood/flute as micro-settings enable/charge choices; sensory hush/vibrations mirror internal shift, evolving causally to "peaceful" close without overt symbolism; 9+ gate met as canyon spires/recurring quiet charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest insights) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intention/memory during playing narrowing to realization; agency in uncasing/entering forecloses avoidance path with cost (trembling, admission); pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-landscape emerges organically from ritual/images, reweighted in final realization (rigidity to flow) without statement; resonant close via canyon hush reprise offers non-literal answer; complexity in guardianship limits lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in biased noticing (hush as threat then peace); rhythmic modulation builds to closure without head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly in veil-fraying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwrought figuratives ("avalanchingly quiet," "lightning finding its path") dominate high-pressure playing beat without full pattern payoff, risking muddle; minor paraphrase loops in quiet/burden motifs; propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic guardianship, world-weaving flute, failure-harvest transforms tropes via specific ritual logic; risk in unconventional realm traversal heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from driftwood lifeline to transformed return.</comment>
