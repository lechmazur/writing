<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied realizations like trembling hands closing on crozier fragments; contradictory impulses to preserve vs. destroy culminate in earned shift to hope. Stoically sensitive trait shown constraining focus amid failures. Minor label-speak ("stoically sensitive nature") in third approximation slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: approximations build density to CR closure in staff's weight shift and "frozen bloom" realization, with conceptual cost of breaking destiny legible on page. Single scene anchors who/where/when immediately; no orientation debt. Pattern of failures teaches creative destruction payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus's pulsing light constrains vivification (catches symbols, burns with nexus philosophy), charging final image where light seems "reborn." Sensory selection (dying light on silver) mirrors internal shift selectively via POV bias. No white-room; tactile crucible/crzoier integration drives action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to interrupt destiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via successive approximations narrowing to fifth's tightening where staff reconfigures options. Agency in humble positioning/micro-choices; cost felt in destroyed expectations ("not into gold or silver"). Minor abstractness in stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically from approximations, resonating in non-literal final whisper ("only prayer worth answering") reweighting failures as preparation without moralizing. "Frozen bloom" image layers ambiguity/earned wisdom. Theme inextricable from arc; no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical noticing: "molecule by molecule"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in dawn realization. Lyrical diction controlled, biased toward transformation metaphors. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/reflection efficiently. Minor paraphrase loops in approximation summaries ("first...failed, as expected") drag rhythm slightly; figurative coherence strong but elevated diction borders register drift in "creative destruction coursed." Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as successive approximation toward self-vivifying staff transforms trope of failed transmutation. Risky lyric CR ("teach it how to burn again") inevitable from particulars; no hedging or templates.</comment>
