<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in historian traits drives scribbling and confrontation choices; embodied rationality shines in "his rational mind calculating every move" during grapple, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through entry→discovery→confrontation→DC closure (master slumps, Elias retrieves letter); orientation anchored early at station/rosebush; cost legible in grapple slip of letter, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory decay (ivy groan, damp earth, flickering light) mirrors moral rot and constrains grapple near platform; rosebush/station evolve to charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth vs noble lie) tightens causally via master's emergence/lunge, forcing sidestep and persuasive shout; agency in paralleling decay forecloses master's fight with felt grapple cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically via station decay parallels and master's "truths are cages," reweighted in final ivy image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in dismantling lie.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (patterns in decay); dialogue natural/subtextual ("lies are prisons") advances goal; rhythmic prose modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Solid propulsion and density, but minor overwriting in opening metaphors (ivy "strangled," rose "thorns") risks coherence in high-pressure entry; no loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noble lies via station historian quest transforms tropes; risk in metaphorical parallels heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
