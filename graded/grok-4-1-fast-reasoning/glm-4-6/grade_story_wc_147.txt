<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mentor's promise and vial intensifies credibly to integration choice, but interiority leans tell-y with stock epiphanies like "motivation grows clearer"; embodied fear in hesitation before suit shows contradiction well, yet lacks deeper flaws complicating peak destabilization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush/vial/memories builds to CR closure where Marina integrates as new sender, reweighting signal as invitation with destabilization cost legible in "physical form begins to destabilize"; orientation anchored early via signal/coordinates/temple; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush, crystalline spires, shifting symbols constrain choices (e.g., water spirals distort sound, temple energy pulses vial); recurring vial as micro-setting charges destabilization; POV-filtered via urgency narrows to immediacies like oxygen dwindle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness energies/mentor fate) signaled early, escalates via textural density (hush intensifies, memories flood, destabilization) under lens, narrowing to integration trade-off; agency in descent/unsnarl bears cost in form destabilization and water breach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via overriding instinct emerges organically from vial/memories/hush particulars, resonant CR ending reweights signal without moralizing; ambiguity in invitation lingers with conceptual cost of becoming guardian.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in hush/vial pulses; rhythmic diction modulates from hush to symphony under stress; minimal dialogue natural; purposeful compression of memories legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but purposeful repetition of "gathered hush"/"crystal perfume vial"/"override instinct"/"time runs short" borders template cadence (e.g., multiple near-identical vial touches); no major loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi temple, memory-touching vial, hush-entity transforms tropes; non-obvious CR turn (signal as invitation) inevitable from particulars; risk in lonesome psychedelic tone heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
