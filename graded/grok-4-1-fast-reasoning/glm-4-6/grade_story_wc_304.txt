<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character motivation to capture the spark drives all micro-choices, embodied in breath catching during the memory surge; interiority particular through honed skill of sifting static, with earned endurance in her quiet flame. Contradictory warmth amid cold stasis acts in scene, compelling the infusion. Final legacy realization earned by process, foreclosing oblivion with conceptual cost. 9+ test met: impulses and choice earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hiss of decay to faint signal to infusion, with Charged Poise closure in emerald's glow and body's deeper repose. Orientation anchored in first sentence (who/where). No shards or transitions needed; lens taught early via process. Cost legible in "last echo coaxed from the body" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto and aurora constrain via "radiant hush" and "hum," narrowing focus to cellular sea; recurring aurora flares recognition at closure. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (emerald rainbows, bone vibration). Micro-setting (obsidian slab, silk pouch) integrates into action. 9+ test: environment charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern emergence and surge, narrowing to infusion with agency in patient sifting. One tightening sufficient: noise to laugh memory reweights oblivion risk. Cost felt in "shift as the last echo was coaxed," charging end. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of snatching life from stillness emerges via particulars (laugh echo, emerald constellation), reweighted in final "treasure" and "keeper of last lights" without statement. Subtext in silence-song paradox lingers with ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from saving sparks. 9+ test: resonant non-literal answer reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (patterns in static, radiant hush); rhythmic modulation peaks in infusion surge. Lyrical compression taught early via hum/grotto, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping. Diction POV-plausible, prose reflects serene watchfulness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "facets scattering... prison for ephemeral" advances object/atmosphere); rhythm varies, ear-test passes. Patterned repetition ("lucidly watchful," "threshold") taught and purposeful, no loops. Minor overwriting in aurora flares slightly dulls propulsion pre-climax; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician as memory-weaver in sky grotto transforms death-prep trope via static-sifting logic; final constellation legacy inevitable from particulars. Risk in lyric texture heightens conceptual stakes without obscurity. No derivatives; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
