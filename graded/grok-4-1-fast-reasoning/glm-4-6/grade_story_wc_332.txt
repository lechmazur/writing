<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority abstract and epiphanic ("cipher of longing encoded"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or embodied stress degradation in pivotal ritual; motivation declarative without micro-choices revealing flaws or hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to palm-press surge as Conceptual Repricing closure; palette glow and archipelago wholeness reconfigure luminous absence with felt belonging cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via "wasn’t enough... needed more."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Palette as micro-setting constrains painting/photography choices and charges final pedestal image; sensory hierarchy (light/whispers over others) reflects mythic POV; whispering archipelago subtly guides via horizon access and wave-sighs cue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early with accumulative deepening to vitalize turn narrowing "stillness" option; agency in ritual but stakes abstract, cost felt obliquely as "quiet joy" replacing absence rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of longing as spoken language emerges via ritual particulars, final palette pulse reweights absence into bridge without moralizing; directish line "cipher... language to be spoken" borders statement but integrates poetically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (light as "liquid memory," mythic whispers); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no dialogue, purposeful elision taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density ("fractured gold," "stolen moonlight") in most sentences lacks pattern payoff, mixed vehicles ("light pool... shard"); final-third paraphrase loops ("dream... come home," "light... illuminate") dull closure image; template cadence in repetitive light-swirls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian myth + light-painting transforms dream-capture trope; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry; irreplaceable palette-logic commits to premise fully.</comment>
