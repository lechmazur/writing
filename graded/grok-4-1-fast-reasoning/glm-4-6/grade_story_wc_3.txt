<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's kindly methodical nature and inherited haunted ambitions compel micro-choices like adjusting the containment field, with embodied excitement ("excitement building within her") contradicting her patience; final shift from sorrow to understanding earned via seed planting. Internal conflict surfaces in loneliness amid urgency, shown through spectral regrets. Minor flaw: diagnostic phrasing like "philosophy rendered in equations" edges toward over-articulation without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to seed germination and CR closure ("everything transforms, everything endures"), reweighting isolation with conceptual cost legible in final kneeling image. Single scene anchored early ("ninety-thousand feet above the cloud layer"); one tightening via analogical breakthrough narrows to planting. No orientation debt; persistent constraint of high-altitude silence shapes all beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's bio-mechanical details ("trees with metallic leaves," "humming magnetic fields") constrain actions like soil matrix planting and charge final constellation branches; sensory selection (thin air, whipping winds) filters through Maris's archivist priorities. Setting evolves with seed growth, mirroring internal transition without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (containment unit, seed) guides pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition physics) signaled early via Hamid's obsession, tightens accumulatively through analogy yielding "mathematical sequence," forcing planting decision with emotional cost of bridging "touching distance." Agency in field adjustment and germination communion forecloses lonely isolation path. Minor slip: escalation relies more on realization than visceral reversal, but lens-appropriate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transition as continuation emerges organically from cuneiform analogies and seed growth, culminating in resonant CR final image reweighting death without moral statement. Subtext in "touching distance" motif shifts from spectral haunting to plant communion. Complexity embraced: Hamid's regrets complicate Maris's inheritance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (analogical lens: "translation and transition"); lyrical compression taught early via murmurs and spectral memories, legible at closure. Prose rhythm modulates from methodical to urgent ("seed germinated within minutes"). No head-hopping; diction biased toward archival precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crystalline structure pulsing... whisper promises" advances atmosphere and stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud smooth. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loop in "haunted ambitions" phrasing (twice near start), and "touching distance缩小" (non-English intrusion dulls closure image slightly, −0.4). No template cadence; metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform physics and botanical quantum encoding transforms isolation trope via analogical turns; "knowledge fruit seed" premise commits fully, with risk-taking in arbor world logic heightening stakes. Final CR feels inevitable from established pattern, no derivative echoes.</comment>
