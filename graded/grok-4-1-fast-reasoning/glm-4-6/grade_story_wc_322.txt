<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in shift from precise knotting ("restrained himself") to chaotic weaving with regret-thread, earning final realization with embodied cost (chest tight, stagger back). Interiority particular to architect's precision-obsessed mind; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failed attempts (stairway snaps back, corridor wavers) densify to CR closure where corridor erupts ("heap of fractured light") with cost (thread burns, exhaustion). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via method shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery's distortions ("staircases coiled like sleeping snakes") constrain choices, charging final image where they "breathe" post-eruption. Sensory selection POV-biased toward impossible angles; evolves causally with weaves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (permanence via memory-weaving) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failures narrowing to abandon-method; agency in micro-choices forecloses precision-path with legible cost (limp thread, stagger). Climax pressure coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of frayed connection emerges organically via failed pure memories vs. regret-weave success, resonant in final reweighting ("frayed, knotted, and alive") without moralizing. Particulars (regret-thread) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with architect's perceptual signature ("impossible angles," thread as "spun moonlight"); rhythmic control modulates from calm description to climax intensity. No elision issues; voice texture distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy climax sentences); metaphors consistent in magical realism without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening but purposeful, not obscuring eruption beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architect weaving belief-made thread transforms illusion tropes; risk in chaotic final weave heightens stakes organically. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight via memory-physics.</comment>
