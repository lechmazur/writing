<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's warmly observant trait drives micro-choices like tracing the cicada and anemones, revealing hierarchy of values in avoiding direct confrontation. Internal conflict subtle in tangential deflection amid Mara's pressure, embodied in persistent observation despite pause's weight. Mara as secondary effectively applies relational pressure, softening at "sand rearranged by a retreating tide." Minor therapy-speak in epiphanies prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tidal observations builds to cadence shift in conversation's "proper cadence" with tide unifying pools as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored early in grotto tidal pool. Closure cost legible in "uncomfortable, existing in between" whisper, foreclosing direct stasis for transitional persistence. Single scene scope perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting of tidal pool constrains Elian's tangential choices and charges final image with incoming tide transforming "isolated pools into something unified." Sensory details (ripples, cool cicada, starlight) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal transitions. Anemones "reaching toward something just beyond" purposefully echoes theme without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating difficult conversation signaled early via Mara's "weight of unsaid words"; textural deepening through observation density narrows to shared epiphany. Agency in Elian's sharing forces Mara's softening, with discomfort cost felt on-page. No reversal needed; single tightening via cicada placement suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of value in transitions emerges organically from particulars like cicada's "persistence despite... in-between moments," reweighting conversation premise in final "change is preparing its next shape." Subtext in silences and Mara's unreadable expression invites ambiguity without morals. Resonant non-literal answer in unifying tide avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elian with distinct perceptual signature in "texture to time" observations; rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tidal pools teach you about transition periods"), distinguishing voices. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short whispers amid lapping waves); high density integrates action/image without loops. Minor metaphor density ("liquid thought," "thin moonlight") coherent and pattern-taught, no muddle in peak "difficult conversation" beat. Varied syntax propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler frame transforms stalled-conversation trope via textural observations, risking lyric over narrative drive successfully. Cicada/grotto particulars feel inevitable; bold POV on "spaces between moments" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
