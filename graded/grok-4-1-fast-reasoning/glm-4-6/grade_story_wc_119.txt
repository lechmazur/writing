<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in particular interiority like muttering fortunes while transposing microdot, revealing values through micro-choices; motivation consistently rooted in redirection without harm. Minor weakness in occasional label-speak like "accidentally prophetic" that borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final fortune ("Your next chapter begins with someone else’s words"), reweighting prophetic role; cost legible in fragile balance image. Orientation anchored immediately in lighthouse post-tavern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and sea crash constrain signals/transmitter work and charge extinguished beam at end; sensory selection (ink/salt fingers, waves) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redirect network via tainted microdot) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through signals and slipped fortune forcing trade-off; agency in orchestration with felt cost in misleading enemies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transposition emerges organically via fortunes nudging paths, resonant CR in final cookie reweighting without moralizing; complexity in neither hero nor villain lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (light as metronome, whispers with waves); diction/rhythm modulates purposefully, distinct from sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("conductor of chaos... puppeteer") during key signals beat dulls propulsion slightly; no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-spycraft in lighthouse transforms tropes organically; risk in cryptic layering heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via final self-echoing fortune.</comment>
