<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied noticing and resolve amid regret, with micro-choices like tracing the stone revealing values; minor slip in label-speak like "luminous regret" abstracts peak emotion without full contradiction in the metamorphosis beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from dusk observation to stone activation and library reconfiguration; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in final paragraphs with legible cost of incomplete restoration ("never be exactly as before").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library and floating gardens constrain choices vividly, with breathing shelves and drifting shadows mirroring internal stakes; river stone as micro-setting charges final honored placement, filtering through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving hope escalates via footage comparisons narrowing options to stone resonance; agency in placing stone forces trade-off, with regret as felt cost unmistakable in dawn reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope's fragility emerges organically from unbound shadows and crystallizing sanctuaries; final image of etched stone reweights premise with resonant ambiguity of vigilance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dusk-noticing diction and rhythmic modulation; lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "comparing silent video footage" repetitions dull mid-beat propulsion; no artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams eroding hope into unbound shadows, transformed via stone mechanics; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably toward vigilant poise.</comment>
