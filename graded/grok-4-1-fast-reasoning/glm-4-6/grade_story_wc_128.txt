<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's shrewd broker traits shine in cargo metaphors and tempered enthusiasm, compelling her initiations; interiority embodied in "heart beat with an exuberance she kept carefully measured." Final orchestration of recognition earned through prior chain, with blind spot in delayed cycles adding cost. Minor reflection anchor tilts present choices without excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered synchronicities from envelope to manuscript link; orientation anchored early in symphony hall. Closure as CR lands on-page with "handwritten note revealed yet another name," reweighting cycles with conceptual cost of indirect compassion. One tightening via composer encounter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library under stars constrains final choice and charges closure image of "pages lying open under starlight"; sensory hierarchy (breeze stirring pages, cool silver locket) filters through Marla's priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (locket as tool) recharges motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uplifting silent contributors signaled early, tightens accumulatively through Frederick intro to composer link; agency in Marla's initiations forecloses profit path ("ignored" Singapore notification). Cost legible in "indirect, sometimes delayed" cycles felt at manuscript revelation. One deepening reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion cycles emerges organically from particulars (locket -> intros -> manuscript), resonant CR at "connecting lost photographs to lighting designers" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silent contributors' undervaluation invites ambiguity on impact's timing. Final image non-literal answer to indirect kindness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cargo/shipping lens on human worth); voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful ("exuberance she kept carefully measured"). Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("The Maestro wants to meet you"). No head-hopping, elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (short final click vs. longer reflections); metaphors coherent/selective ("sea fog," "falling leaves"). Minor "cycles" recurrence pattern-taught thematically, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms synchronicity trope via locket-manuscript chain, making indirect compassion inevitable in hindsight. Memorable Marla's broker philosophy uplifts cultural underbelly organically. Risk in accumulative quiet ending heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
