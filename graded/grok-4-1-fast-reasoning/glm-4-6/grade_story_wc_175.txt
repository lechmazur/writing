<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral acts is concrete and intensifies via monarch falls guiding his knots; micro-choices like incorporating the dead butterfly reveal values without contradiction. Internal reverence shows embodied in unhurried motions, avoiding stock epiphanies. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously, keeping it strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of building and monarch interruptions builds to Charged Poise closure where Elias steps back, reconfiguring transient honoring with dissolution cost legible in "rain would come tomorrow." Orientation anchors immediately in grotto and migration. Single scene fits scope, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "wet stone and distant ozone" and moist moss constrain building (fingers trace quartz, updraft lifts wing). Grotto above clouds charges final image, mirroring ephemerality. POV bias filters via esoteric noticing (pulsing quartz vein), no white-room; 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring via signal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via falling monarchs tightening into incorporation beat that narrows to completion amid foreseen dissolution. Agency in knots forecloses permanence with felt cost. Entry to 8+ barely met as one deepening suffices but lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of honoring transience emerges organically from monarch/moth/structure images, culminating in resonant CR: "his own path an interrupted cadence" reweights without moralizing. Subtext in silent poem avoids platitudes. Minor slips in abstract tells like "curator of moments" prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (erratic monarch as "stuttering flame"); rhythmic prose modulates from reverent to profound quiet. No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture purposeful for esoteric lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in building beats, but patterned repetitions ("blushing stillness" x3, "transiently rooted" x3) create paraphrase loops in final third, dulling closure image slightly (−0.8 non-closure cap). Varied syntax passes ear test; no filter stacks. Heavy artifact debt caps at 8.8 but pulls to 7.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud grotto signals for extinct migration transforms tropes of loss into esoteric realism; knotting fallen butterfly feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
