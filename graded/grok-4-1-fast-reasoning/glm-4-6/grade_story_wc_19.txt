<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath catching rust ozone, fingers pressing porcelain cheeks) reveals particular compulsion tied to doll; motivation intensifies through absorbing silences with agonizing stretch. Minor abstract slips like "intangibly tangible" prevent peak without embodied cost. Final fulfillment earned via prior ritual, foreclosing isolation with inner vault.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to CR closure where Elara's world reconfigures (bunker as "frame" for stolen quiet, doll throbs). Orientation anchors early (bunker child, inversion hour). Cost legible in "thud" lurch and "ghost of aftertaste," charging final whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (moist cloud belly, starlight rain) filters through Elara's priorities, constraining collection via trellis vibrations. Doll as micro-setting charges closure image. No white-room; spatial float to thud coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect silences) signaled early, escalates via density increase (sharp/moist/old silences) and sprout deepening under accumulative lens. Agency in sifting/tracing forecloses paths with embodied cost ("stretched and contracted... agonizing"). Final lurch crystallizes stance with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intangible collection emerges organically via doll-trellis-silence particulars, reweighting isolation in final image (whisper to smiling doll). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in unbroken silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (silence flavors as textures). Prose texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm with pressure (short lurch sentences vs. flowing collection).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful silence repetition accumulates texturally without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "jeweler sorting diamonds") dense but pattern-taught, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis (inverting gravity, silence flavors via doll) feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
