<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "turn an apology into action" compels the pivotal choice to disarm, rooted in embodied conflict like the "chill ran down Elias’s spine"; Anja applies targeted pressure. Minor slip in epiphanic summary at close slightly abstracts the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: examination therefore revelation therefore disarming (DC) with legible cost in thwarting Silas's trap, crystallized in "he would not let apology become extinction." Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene tightens once meaningfully at Anja's "reversal" diagnosis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shop's "vibrant hush" and "dust motes dancing" constrain deliberate pace and charge closure via corner music box's "ticking...mark[ing]...redemption." Sensory selection POV-filtered (Elias's unease amid perfumes); no micro-setting constraint elevates to 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent delayed murder) signaled early, tightens causally at photosensitive trigger reveal forcing disarm trade-off; agency in "Can you disarm it?" forecloses trap path with felt cost. Coheres under causal lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of flawed apologies redeemed through action emerges via heart's shift from trap to "honest tribute," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "second opinion" reprise; minor tidy resolution tempers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual bias (ticking as "bomb"); dialogue sparse, natural, goal-driven ("This isn’t a repair"). Prose rhythm modulates tension, distinct texture in "vibrant hush"; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in revelation beat, but "aptly deliberate" paraphrase loop (pace/hands) and minor template cadence in openings dull propulsion slightly (−0.4). Rhythm varies; no closure artifacts; vivid verbs propel climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as photo-triggered "reversal" bomb in casket transforms murder trope ingeniously via watchmaker logic; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risking bold conceit without gimmick.</comment>
