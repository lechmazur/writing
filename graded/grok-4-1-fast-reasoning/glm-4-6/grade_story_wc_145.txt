<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's subtle confidence and cartographical expertise drive micro-choices like tracing droplets and cross-referencing, earning the realization; embodied cold and shadows ground emotions. Internal conflict subtle but shown in nagging scholarly mind under tranquility. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but competence balanced with isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns, phrasebook, and hydrology builds to CR closure in final sketch as patterns fade, with legible cost of ephemerality. Orientation anchored immediately in outpost/lake. Single scene coherent, one tightening via "understanding flooding him."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Windowpane condensation and frozen lake constrain choices, charging final image as patterns fade; sensory details (cold seeping, clicks echoing) selective via Elias's eye. Subtly mirrors turbulent thoughts without overt symbolism. Evolving environment (fading patterns) affects action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher convergence for river origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern clarity and phrasebook linkage to journey decision. One tightening forecloses inaction with felt isolation cost. Agency in interpretation, but stakes lean conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral knowledge surfacing like water emerges from particulars (droplets as coordinates, rivers' hidden origins); final notebook sketch offers resonant CR without moral. Complexity in patience vs. transience lingers. No tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with cartographer's perceptual signature (river spirals, hydrological faults); rhythmic prose modulates from serene to revelatory. No elision issues; diction purposeful without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("breaking dam," "fallen leaves") clusters without payoff dulls peak realization; some repetition of "condensation patterns." Rhythm varies, propulsion strong to closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of condensation coordinates, multilingual phrasebook, and hydrological convergence transforms discovery trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmickry; memorable voice anchors specificity.</comment>
