<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Methodical trait drives concrete micro-choices like tracing rope patterns as an "index," earning final reconfiguration; embodied pull ("bones were gears shifting") reveals contradiction without stock phrasing. Final endurance of "work just beginning" feels hard-won with ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seal touch causes door open → rope reconfiguration → doors merge as RR with legible cost in "hard-won" clarity and fused seal implying endless task. One tightening via pattern recognition narrows options cleanly; orientation anchored early in clock room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope braids and seal constrain pivotal choice and charge final fused image; sensory details (brass oil, starlight void) filter through archivist bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Infinite library evolves causally with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve anomaly) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven braid reconfiguration under causal lens, foreclosing void with felt cost in sealed promise and "work just beginning." No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absence-as-potential theme emerges organically from seal-rope-library arc, resonant in final chime as "words" reweighting fables without statement; complexity lingers in endless doors, inviting reflection via earned image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with archivist perceptual signature (patterns as "language"); voice texture modulates rhythmically, diction biased toward archival motifs like "cataloging configurations." No elision or head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., scents ground then mingle with fables); rhythm varies, but minor figurative density in void/platform beat ("stitched from threads," "hues that defied color") risks coherence without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival mysticism (rope as decipherable code mirroring seal) transforms portal trope; risk in patterned elision pays off inevitably at merge, heightening stakes through non-obvious braid mechanics.</comment>
