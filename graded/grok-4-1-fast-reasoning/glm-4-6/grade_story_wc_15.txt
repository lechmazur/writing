<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied details like indigo-stained fingers and trembling hands under pressure; final sewing choice earned through prior discoveries and sleepwalking compulsion. Contradictory impulses in weaving impossible air amid ruins reveal hierarchy of values. Single-POV voice particular to a weaver's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from empty tide pools to canyon ruins, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing where empty tides reweight as "invitation" with felt cost in broken precedents. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One tightening via ruin discovery to air-sewing seals closure legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon walls "glowing like internal organs" and skeletal looms constrain navigation and inspire sewing; recurring plate warms via walls, charging final kelp-orchid image. Sensory selection (cracked tide pools, predawn light) reflects weaver's priorities. No white-room; spatial progression coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform loss/ruin) signaled early via vanished tides; escalation via sleepwalking to labyrinth deepens to air-sewing reversal under Accumulative lens, narrowing options with impossibility overcome at cost of trembling exertion. Agency peaks in "sew through air itself," foreclosing decay. Cost unmistakable in pulsing heartbeat image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of broken precedents emerges organically from particulars: tide exodus invites creation, ruin yields reverence without moralizing. Final kelp-silk orchids reweight premise non-literally, resonating with haunting optimism. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in sleepwalking lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with weaver-specific perceptual signature ("wharf-silk," threads catching light); rhythmic control modulates from dreamlike drift to thickened air intensity. Purposeful compression in sleep paths taught early, pays off glowing at climax. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayer (e.g., "copper absorbing something ancient" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels from shore to sunlit close without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (canyon "wound," looms "skeletons"); zero figurative muddle in peak sewing beat. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kelp-silk orchids sewn through air via copper plate transforms ruin tropes into inevitable beauty from weaver's traits. Risky surrealism (sewing air, glowing paths) heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity in tide "invitation" feels non-obvious.</comment>
