<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to balance her father's legacy through honest aid is concrete and drives micro-choices like giving away the ink pot, with embodied tension in her tightened mouth; internal conflict between inheritance and redemption shows in repurposing skills without gain. Minor diagnostic telling in backstory ("brutally so, which had made her childhood difficult") slightly abstracts without full embodiment. Elena applies relevant pressure as secondary. Climax choice feels earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: routine study → timed wait → ink activation → escape, with tightening at guard's entry narrowing options. On-page closure as Decisive Change (breach success) with legible cost in the 90-second window and guard's resisting brain. Orientation anchored early in prep room. No shards or ambiguity; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prep room specifics (porcelain glint under fluorescents, cold steel, formaldehyde) constrain choices via hiding spot, keypad access, and patrol rhythms; sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's precision (echoing footsteps like heartbeat). "Deathly vitality" charges tone and mirrors theme without overt symbolism. Bodies track cleanly through escape; micro-setting (ink pot, UV light) shapes tactics and final handoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe asylum breach) signaled early, escalates causally via guard patrol forcing ink use and 90-second sprint, agency in Maya's planning forecloses violent options with felt risk. Cost legible in weakened Elena's grip and timed resistance. One tightening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of skill repurposing for justice emerges organically from ink's evolution and final gift, reweighting inheritance in Charged Poise closure without statement. Subtext in Elena's whisper contrasts father's con; ambiguity lingers in Maya's shadow return. No moralizing despite close line from Elena.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Maya's perceptual bias (mathematical rhythms, ink caution); voice texture in precise diction ("liquefied rigid thinking") modulates under pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Elena's praise evokes tension); no head-hopping, clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ink dip advances plot/character); rhythm varies, propulsion fits tension peaks. Minor artifact in "deathly vitality" recurrence and final "having" series, but purposeful echo without loop dulling closure. No filter stacks or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ink pot's mind-liquefying magic transforms con/heist tropes into redemption via funeral asylum breach; fresh synthesis of inheritance, math-fairness, and "waiting actively." Risky magical realism grounds in specifics without retreat; inevitable hindsight in pot's handoff.</comment>
