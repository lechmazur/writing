<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied hope vs. heartbreak, concretely shown when the button sparks "a spark of it now," compelling micro-choices like tracing Micah's file. Final endurance of sorrow with "faint warmth" earns change via prior discoveries. Minor slip: some emotions told via summary ("tactfully hopeful by nature") rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dust swipe to button/note/drawing chain, culminating in CR closure where sleeving artifacts reconfigures shelves as "network of... bright moments" with legible cost ("didn’t heal... more bearable"). Orientation anchored early in file room. No causality breaks; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "sterile hum," "accumulated dust patterns," and brittle pages filter through Elias's reverent bias, constraining choices (e.g., bottom shelf focus leads to button). Button as recurring micro-object charges final image. Minor genericism in "endless shelves" at close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify kindnesses amid sorrow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discovery chain that deepens stakes and forecloses cynicism in final stance crystallization. Agency in tracing/sleeving shows endurance with on-page cost (persistent heartbreak). Enters 8+ via trade-off in charged poise image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden human connections emerges organically from button-to-drawing chain, resonating in final "quiet click... small, sacred victory" without moralizing. Complexity lingers in unhealed sorrow. Returning "small kindness" motif charges closure without checklist feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: reverent, tactile noticing (e.g., "metal cool and weightless"). Rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical close. No dialogue; purposeful compression in discoveries legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("small kindness" x3-4, "quiet" repetitions) and elevated diction ("tactfully hopeful," "unfurling of the past") create slight scaffold in reflective beats. No closure harm; metaphors purposeful (pebble/ocean). Propulsion strong in discovery sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist chaining marginalia kindnesses via button transforms forgotten bureaucracy trope into hopeful architecture. Button/drawing payoff feels inevitable from dust cue. Bold lyric risk in textural discoveries heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
