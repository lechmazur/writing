<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage drives endurance with felt exhaustion cost, embodied in calloused hands caressing the globe at close. Interiority concrete via sensory ties to ghosts, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal vision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream density escalates to captain's vision and exposure as RR/Charged Poise closure with exhaustion cost legible in "working with such clarity always exhausted Elara." Orientation anchored early in shrine; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and melted snow globe as micro-settings constrain meditation/visions and charge final caress image, filtering through Elara's bias. Sensory selection (ethereal blue, diesel scent in vision) purposeful and POV-shaped; recurring globe evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose buried truths) signaled early via dreams, tightens accumulatively to vision-driven exposure with agency and exhaustion cost felt on-page. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload; final preparation crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truths/windows between worlds emerges from particulars like dream cameos and globe flicker, resonating in final "echo until it dissolved into starlight" without moralizing. Subtext in careful weaving invites ambiguity on liminal costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in ice/starlight diction; rhythmic modulation heightens vision immersion. Voice distinct and biased toward ethereal whispers; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("candle-lit shrine" motif recurs statically) and elevated diction drift in peak vision slightly dull propulsion. Rhythm varies; no closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver ghost whisperer premise transforms supernatural tropes via dream-weaving mechanics and arctic specificity, inevitable in globe-charged close. Bold ethereal voice risks poeticism but coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
