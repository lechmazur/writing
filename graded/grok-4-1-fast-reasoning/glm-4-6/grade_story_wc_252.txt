<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied grace in diving and hauling contrasts internal "violence" effectively; micro-choices like clutching scrimshaw build to earned change on island. Minor slip: epiphanies like "combative tenderness" verge on unearned labels without deeper contradiction in pivotal hesitation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrimshaw find → whale vibration → island shimmer builds density to CR closure where scrimshaw dims after charm pull, reweighting conformity with detachment cost felt in "heart unlock." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via glowing carvings suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via diver's bias: "latticed shadows," "water grew warmer" constrain swim and charge island tree image. Scrimshaw as micro-setting evolves tactilely ("smooth against her skin"), mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. conformity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whale call pulling against dock life; hesitation on island forecloses return-to-prison path with legible detachment cost. Agency in charm pull crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "gentleness as weapon" emerges organically from grace-as-rebellion arc; final laugh over water recharges whale motif non-literally, inviting ambiguity on peace-as-prison. Minor drift: "violence impossible" feels stated early without full counter-reading tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature in fluid syntax ("moved like liquid"); rhythmic modulation peaks in desperate swim without head-hopping. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; opening anchors stakes vividly. Minor loops in "whale’s call/song" (three paraphrases) and grace repetitions dull ~5% of beats, but no closure touch; read-aloud ear holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scrimshaw-key unlocking mythic island transforms pirate trope into internal rebellion; risk in whale-as-method heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via bone hum motif.</comment>
