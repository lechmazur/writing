<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover withheld truth drives consistent sensory-grounded choices, culminating in earned reconfiguration of self as soul-cartographer. Interiority particular via tactile mapping, with embodied pain in "agonizing... unstitched" return signaling cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene prevents 9+; final realization feels poised without raw simultaneity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sensing spike leads to shard → travel → nudge → truth emergence as CR with legible cost in painful return and "debt paid." Single-shard structure with legible transition; orientation anchored early in spaceport details. Closure image of "truth... a stone" reconfigures map with undeniable weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory specificity (rust texture, ozone tang, shard's pulsing light) filters through POV bias, constraining discovery at workbench. Repair bay evolves causally across realities, mirroring internal void-filling; recurring bay charges final solidity. Micro-object (shard) shapes tactics and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth discovery) tightens causally via shard activation and probability nudge, narrowing to high-cost intervention. Agency in "focused thought... nudged the probability" forecloses erasure path; return pain makes cost visceral. Escalation sufficient but lacks micro-reversal before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inward mapping emerges organically from sensory action to soul-cartography, reweighted in "forgotten truth its newly-charted centerpiece." Final shard-as-memento offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like Chimera Log avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile vibrations/echoes; voice texture poetic yet sensory-propelled. Rhythmic modulation peaks in travel's "world dissolved... disorienting silence." Minor register elevation ("tectonic plates") slightly jars under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; rhythm varies with scene urgency. Opening metaphor cluster ("symphony... stage") borders overwriting but teaches lyric pattern paid in closure. No loops; clean causality in action beats like shard touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory interdimensional cartography transforms parallel-world trope via personal truth-stake. Risky CR closure ("cartographer of his own soul") inevitable from shard mechanics. No derivatives; bold inward pivot heightens ingenuity.</comment>
