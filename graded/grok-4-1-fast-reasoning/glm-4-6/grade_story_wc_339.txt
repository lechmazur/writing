<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's quietly analytic trait drives contradictory impulses—persistent study versus dawning acceptance—culminating in an earned renunciation of his quest. Arthur applies precise pressure as a foil, revealing Elias's blind spot in the void transmission. Final choice forecloses his obsession with visible cost in steady voice and snow globe shake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via three transmissions, pattern break at the scream-cut-short void forces CR closure where Elias accepts absence of release. Orientation anchored early in sunken library. Cost legible in "some threads aren’t meant to be untangled—they’re meant to be cut."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken ship library and waterlogged books constrain analysis to salvaged transmissions; snow globe as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal shift from chaos to stillness. Sensory details (pressing water, swollen spines) filter through Elias's priorities. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through transmissions narrowing from panic to void, forcing stance crystallization in acceptance. Third transmission's abrupt silence tests commitment with agency in continued analysis. Visible cost in foreclosed quest charges ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release's physics emerges organically from transmissions' patterns and snow globe's settling glitter, reweighted in final shake seeing "possibility." No moralizing; resonant CR answers obsession without statement. Complexity in Arthur's "not everyone gets the chance" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias toward analytic details; distinct voices—Elias precise, Arthur hollow/poetic. Dialogue goal-driven, subtext-heavy (e.g., "You’re not just studying lettings go"). Rhythmic control modulates melancholy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, vivid propulsion (e.g., "voice as hollow as a shipwrecked bell"); metaphors consistent and purposeful without muddle. Minor density slip in opening figurative cluster, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Varied syntax, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Death as library visitor analyzing Earhart-era transmissions in sunken setting transforms tropes; snow globe's evolving role offers non-obvious angle on letting go. Risky quiet CR feels inevitable from priors.</comment>
