<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in trembling fingers and aching wrists builds to earned reach for blossom, revealing contradictory cling to pain and desire for release; shyly unstoppable trait shown through persistent writing despite centuries, though label repetition slightly abstracts it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from postcard to glowing pulse and melody leading to blossom RR/Charged Poise; closure cost legible in "pain... began to dissolve, transforming into light" with prior longing foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearlescent shell and reef-shadow sea constrain solitude and charge cliff climax bathed in blossom light; sensory hierarchy (humming walls, off-key wind) mirrors insomniac perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pain-to-beauty tightens via postcard glow and kneel/reach agency, foreclosing hoarded pain with dissolution cost; single cadence shift under textural lens reweights to armistice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges via recurring pain-beauty images shifting at blossom absorption; final new postcard offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable poetic perceptual signature (nebulae ink, photosynthesize pain) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("across centuries," "photosynthesize pain into beauty" x2) and metaphor density in blossom beat dull propulsion slightly; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh immortal poet in shell transforms longing trope via postcard-blossom synthesis; risk in centuries-spanning lyric fantasy heightens stakes organically.</comment>
