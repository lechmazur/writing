<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arthur's synesthetic interiority and shift from encore-seeking to guardian earned via coin-amplified performance; contradictory impulses in despair vs. final act compel closure choice with visible cost. Final bow renunciation forecloses personal glory path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: coin touch → whistling → temporal waves changing timeline, landing DC closure in "timeline stabilizing" and restoration plans image with transformation cost. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard garden's silver bark/blue leaves constrain centering/whistling choice and charge final placement; sensory details (humming fruits) filter through synesthetic POV, evolving with echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save theater) tightens via coin enabling agency in performance; causal escalation narrows options to amplified echoes, with felt cost in Arthur's nature reconfiguration charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encores rewriting despair emerges via orchard performance to "haunted...by possibility"; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant with prior timeline fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("taste the notes") biases noticing; stable limited POV with rhythmic lyricism modulates to charged poise at "rising nostalgia...performances yet to come."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; minor figurative density in garden ("colored ripples") purposeful but borders overwrite in non-peak beats—strong rhythm elevates closure line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost + tarot coin synthesis transforms vaudeville tropes into timeline rewrite; risk in mystic orchard payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
