<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Texture-driven perception uniquely roots motivation and micro-choices; final renunciation of faces earned via sky portrait with felt cost of raw hands and lost library.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from coin mechanism to light assembly; CR closure in puddle fractals reconfigures blindness, cost legible in destroyed library and internalized sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hollowed trunk and floorboard indentations constrain safe discovery and fractal sky; puddle reprise charges final image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Demolition rumble escalates density to wrecking ball climax, narrowing options; agency in rushed assembly yields sky but forecloses library with visible debris cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Patterns over faces emerges organically via light manipulation; puddle reflection offers non-literal answer, reweighting blindness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with fractal/texture perceptual signature; rhythmic diction modulates from hush to pounding without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synonym loops on "sky," "fractally precise," and "indentations" in final third create template cadence and dull closure propulsion; paraphrase redundancy in ending reflections drags density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's sky portrait in guild tree-library synthesizes fresh angle on perception and art; coin-safe fractal mechanic transforms premise organically.</comment>
