<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in past-life memory compels micro-choices like dabbing tear on lens, with embodied tremors; however, epiphanies like "pilgrim of sparks within him understood that healing required finding where love had been misplaced" lean diagnostic, diluting contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from breathing to sparks' webs; CR closure in final realization reweights "foggy lucidity" as vision between worlds, with cost of endless journey legible in "his journey had just begun."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct's wisteria-draped arches and camera obscura constrain projections, charging sparks' climax; sensory filter (wisteria scent, metallic tang) reflects artist's priorities, evolving to petals falling in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to reveal unused love tightens accumulatively via breath-sharpened sparks forming bridges; agency in healing act forces stance shift, with cost felt in passersby's unearned smiles and Elias's expanding heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sparks motif emerges organically from projections, reweighting unused love's storage in final bridges without moralizing; resonance in "invisible currents that connect all beings" invites ambiguity on healing's reach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow dances; lyrical rhythm modulates from tentative ("hands trembled") to poised, suiting textural lens without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density weaves action with sensory propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in breathing cycles ("inhaled deeply... each breath") and figurative density in peak ("luminous webs... bridges of light") slightly dull climax rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Camera obscura fused with sparks of unused love transforms mystic tropes into specific artist's tool for healing; fresh CR risks lyrical accumulation without gimmick.</comment>
