<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in sorting buttons to alter prophecy, but interiority relies on poetic abstractions like "hums with unspoken truths" without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final choice feels earned via process but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under deadline stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button sorting accumulates density toward echo's chorus clarifying prophecy as "lattice of choices" (CR closure with felt time cost via nearly empty hourglass); orientation anchored early in warehouse/echo/jar; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (aged resin, slanted beams, button textures) filters through Elara's priorities, with hourglass and warehouse constraining urgency and final turn; recurring buttons as micro-setting charge closure image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy via echo/buttons before hourglass empties) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations from button stories narrowing to final pearl button's placement; agency in cataloging forecloses fixed-fate path with visible time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fate as choices emerges organically from button wisdom seeping into Elara, resonant in final "map of possibilities" without moralizing; prophecy reweights from chain to lattice in closure image, inviting ambiguity on destiny's malleability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (echo matching heartbeat, buttons as life fragments); rhythmic modulation builds quiet intensity to closure turn; no dialogue, but voice specificity avoids generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("truth unraveled" x3, "quietly inspired" bookends/repeats) and minor synonym churn in button descriptions dull high-pressure sorting beat; rhythm varies read-aloud but density dips in repetitive warehouse motifs without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of buttons as decision fragments unscrambles surreal prophecy via tactile cataloging, transforming fate trope into textured possibility lattice; risk of solo surreal scene heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at hourglass turn.</comment>
