<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Archetypal guides and passive traveler lack embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure; wisdom dispensed via advice feels unearned rather than tested, as in Marek's whispers with no internal pushback shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at the pool withdrawal; orientation anchored early in twilight ridgeway; cost legible in identity shift from circumstance to choice, though linkage more poetic than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirror-like pool and mist-laden path constrain the traverse and charge final image; sensory weave of glow, pulse, and lapping shorelines reflects priorities without catalog; recurring shoreline motif mirrors internal evolution purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find courage signaled early tightens accumulatively to pool confrontation; agency via traveler's step and withdrawal forecloses prior constraints with felt cost in the glowing ticket's proof, but opposition remains atmospheric over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of courage as persistence through indirection emerges via pool's possibilities reflecting post-leash choice; final light-withdrawal reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; earned from particulars like star paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rhythmic cadence and perceptual bias toward misty horizons stable in third-person; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual (Elara's explanation layers lullaby); no head-hopping, diction modulates poetically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels with varied syntax and zero loops; high density integrates image/action seamlessly; minor metaphor density purposeful in peak pool beat without muddle, passing read-aloud test cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh allegorical synthesis of ferry guides and leash-break transforms self-discovery tropes via star-punched paths and courage-pool; risk in poetic indirection heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
