<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlo's motivation to defy hopelessness intensifies through embodied actions like chanting and spinning the knot, earning the renewal at "renewed purpose"; interiority concrete via sensory ties to craft. Mild archetypal wanderer risks stock phrasing, but micro-choices under pressure reveal specific philosophy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptions deepen from chant to spinning, landing CR closure in "hopelessness is merely the absence of created light" with conceptual cost of restored purpose reweighting the premise. Orientation anchored early in fortress entry; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic tiles and blooming vines constrain revelation via light/shadow play, charging final image; sensory details (lavender kerosene, torch flicker) filter through Marlo's illuminator bias. 9+ gate met: recurring fire object shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mosaic fragments to full message, narrowing to fire-spinning agency; cost legible in "gravity of hopelessness" defied through created light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of self-created light emerges from particulars like knot and mosaics, reweighting via CR realization without statement; final image of walking with purpose offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light-pattern noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged spinning beat. Voice suits fireworks designer without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (light/shadow patterns) taught early; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in opening sensory strokes risks density but serves accumulative texture without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mosaic note revealed by fire-spinning transforms seeker trope into fresh illuminator's epiphany; risk in perceptual filtering pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
