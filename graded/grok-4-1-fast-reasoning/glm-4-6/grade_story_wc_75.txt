<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's historically oriented interiority drives micro-choices like kneading harder and baking the "L," revealing contradictory impulses to preserve amid fragility. Embodied emotions (knuckles white, wheat and ash taste) earn the final stance crystallization. Child's question forces hierarchy of values with communal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from survey to ritual sharing, culminating in CR via Elara's response and ash-taste image reweighting preservation premise. Orientation anchored early (grotto behind waterfall). One tightening (fresco loss to communal initials) with felt cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's damp limestone, pooled water, and fading frescoes constrain preservation tactics and mirror internal fragility, charging final oven warmth vs. gloom. Sensory hierarchy (rosewater dread to yeast) reflects Elara's priorities. Recurring murals evolve causally with grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts amid displacement) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ritual where baking initials forecloses forgetting with ash-cost bite. Agency in shaping "L" and response narrows options. Communal pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mourning arts as kin emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted in child's question and Elara's non-literal answer without full moralizing. Initials motif shifts from personal to communal with ambiguity of sustaining hope. Final image resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: Elara catalogs changes historically, modulating rhythm from verdant haze to grey gloom. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Kaelen's flat report pressures). Diction/rhythm heightens ritual density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (slick water, crackling crust) without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for ear (short query amid flowing prose). No figurative muddle; overwrites purposeful in accumulative build. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: baking initials as edible tombstones transforms displacement tropes via grotto ritual, risking poetic tone that heightens stakes. Lens reprise inevitable in hindsight; no hedging, commits to rosewater dread payoff.</comment>
