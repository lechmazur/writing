<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in father's teachings compel higher-stakes choices like writing the premise; embodied emotions via "cold weight" of pen reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses between grief and truth act in scene, earning the final resolve. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("solemn playfulness") slightly undercuts embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries (pen nib to star chart) tightening knowledge toward CR closure; chart's "hidden truths are not in the stars, but what they watch" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of violence loops. Orientation anchored early in observatory. One meaningful deepening suffices; no slips touch ending image of pen as promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (echoing observatory, brass sphere spinning "like a slow, deliberate regret") filter through POV's star-reading past, constraining search to desk/drawer. Recurring pen nib charges final image, mirroring internal orbits. Environment subtly guides choices without static repetition; high specificity elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover murder) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepenings like bent nib contradicting grief and chart narrowing to maintenance route. Agency in precise searches forecloses accident narrative with felt threat cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; minor abstractness in stakes doesn't dull on-page cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth via contradiction emerges organically from particulars like premise-writing and chart, reweighting "orbits of regret" from personal to violent loops in final image. Resonance avoids moralizing, inviting ambiguity on killer's power. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question; strong without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of "devotedly observant" bias in noticing bent nib and taped chart; rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to resolute. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction purposeful, prose-as-character reflects inherited curiosity. Distinct texture sustains under realization pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but patterned artifacts like "contradiction" loops ("contradiction began to bloom... screaming now") and repeated "solemn playfulness" trigger −0.7 for paraphrase churn dulling peak beats. Rhythm varies, strong verbs propel; no closure touch. Minor overwriting in metaphors doesn't obscure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Proof-by-contradiction method transforms journalism-mystery trope into mathematical investigative frame, fresh via celestial/heiress synthesis. Final pen reprise as truth-tool feels inevitable from particulars. Bold risk in reflective accumulative drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
