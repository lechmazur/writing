<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied polishing ritual and celestial pull, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of patience over brilliance; final placement earns spiritual shift. Subtle contradictions (yearning vs. peace) act in meditative present rather than alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dull glass to gleaming via polishing/memory interleaving, culminating in CR closure with conceptual cost of tedious transformation legible in "pearl of stillness" placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and mist constrain ritual space and mirror internal curves; sea glass as micro-setting charges final image, with sensory zephyr bloom evolving causally to hum of approval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, deepens texturally through polishing progression narrowing to placement; agency in deliberate rotations forecloses burning path with patience cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient transformation emerges organically via glass's shift, reweighting earthbound premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in glow "quiet rebellion against the darkness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (star-gazing poetics) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from slow steps to ceremonial rotations, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (coiling mist, dilating pupil) propels meditative cadence; minor paraphrase loops in glass descriptions ("smooth now," "edges softened") but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of star watcher polishing sea glass to fulfill no-fire promise transforms tropes through grotto ritual; risk in poetic prose heightens meditative stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
