<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like filing the needle despite knowing it will tear grooves, reveal contradictory desperation and precision; motivation intensifies credibly to the earned crack in numbness. Final stance reconfiguration feels compelled by prior bodily struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from setup to reversed playback crescendo; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly on "filament of hush...snapped" with legible emotional cost in partial breakthrough. Single scene, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "wooden shells...sleeping giants" and "guttural frequency...through the stone floor" constrain choices and mirror internal numbness, charging the final image of sleeping drums pulsing with her heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early tightens via risky needle filing and palm-pressing amid chaotic vibrations, forcing trade-off in crude friction; cost legible in "it would tear at the grooves" and messy sliver of feeling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of chaotic resonance breaking stillness emerges organically from reversed sounds testing her "shell," reweighting via final "messy, painful, and beautiful throb" without moralizing; invites lingering ambiguity on full cure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature of bodily vibrations (e.g., "tremors travel...through her skeleton"); lyrical compression taught early pays off legibly at closure, modulating rhythm with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful textural figures like "reversed architecture of sound," avoiding loops; minor figurative density in peak playback fits accumulative pattern without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf musician hacking phonograph with backward drum-test discs transforms silence trope into bodily ingenuity; risk in crude method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cavern resonance.</comment>
