<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between desire and chastity drives micro-choices like pulling the lover's echo thread despite gasp; embodied warmth/pulse under cold anchors emotion. Final endurance of paradox as "whole" feels earned via prior resistances. Minor label-speak ("paradox draped in silk and virtue") slightly abstracts traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes builds from single voice to chorus, culminating in RR/Charged Poise where snapped red thread reconfigures self with conceptual cost of defying conformity. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/sanctuary. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "echo burst forth—a laugh, her own."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver snow/crystals constrain bare feet; prisms refract colors mirroring fractured self, charging final flare image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to pulsing threads under stress. Environment evolves causally with untangling, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-unlocking) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via resisting knot/whisper, forcing micro-renunciations; final snap forecloses conformity path with felt echo-cost. Agency in deliberate pulls narrows options. Minor abstract stakes early slightly dulls visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of chosen freedom emerges organically from untangled regrets to self-song; final "dawn entirely her own" resonates non-literally, reweighting paradox without moral. Subtext in whispers/lullaby implies defiance. Counter-reading (safety as prison) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual bias poetic (steps "defied frozen hush"); rhythm modulates with intensity (faster fingers under resistance). Compression taught early pays off in charged echoes. Elevated diction consistent to voice, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in every peak sentence ("threads wove... shimmering with unspoken words," "knot of half-truths") muddles clarity; mixed metaphors (light/silk/sound echoes) violate logic. Paraphrase loops in ending ("no longer a cage but a stage," repetitive affirmations). Template cadence in "The [element] [glowed/continued/flared]."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan paradox with echo-harvest/prism threads transforms introspection trope via light-tactile mechanics. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable conceptual frame (echoes as memories) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
