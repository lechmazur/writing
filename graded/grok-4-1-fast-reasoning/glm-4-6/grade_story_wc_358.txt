<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in tremor vs. precise handwriting and instinct at Container Z-379, earning the final realization of blind spots with felt cost in expertise's limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to CR closure: deliberate weapon realized in final evidence beat, with undeniable conceptual cost in "warnings—because some events require nothing less than a reckoning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shipping container labyrinth constrains survey via unnatural spirals and vortex, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (wind, salt, dust) reflects investigator's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (foresight vs. silencing) deepens via agency in sensor measurements revealing chemical, reweighting to deliberate act with visible cost in patch-mocked failure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unannounced convergences emerges organically from fuel additive and container dispersal; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting expertise's blind spots without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hazy precision" phrasing and selective noticing (e.g., patch pulsing) holds under stress; rhythmic control modulates from survey rhythm to charged ending poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor patterned repetition of "rapidly adapting mind" and patch mentions creates subtle paraphrase loops without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation fuel silencing town via container vortex transforms anomaly tropes; risk in silence-as-weapon premise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
