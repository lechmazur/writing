<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses on priorities (art vs sustenance) act in scene during hesitation, earning the balanced choice with felt cost of indecision; interiority concrete via embodied details like furrowed brow and tightening grip. Final founder status earned by prior struggle without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of conceived details builds to pattern break at hesitation ("lanterns flickered, their light dimming"), tightening to Charged Poise closure where bottle cools and town lives, cost of painstaking labor legible in "slipping like sand through his fingers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lanterns as recurring micro-setting constrain choices (dim/brighten with hesitation) and charge final image of thriving cove; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemist notes powdered-glass sand, warm bottle) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perfect revival) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening of details and hesitation turn narrowing options to balance/compromise; agency in conception forecloses extremes with on-page cost ("weight of its purpose settled... like lead").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of labored true creation emerges organically from particulars like bottle's demand and evolving lanterns; final image ("creation never truly ends—it evolves") offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fragments as "echoes," lanterns pulsing like accomplices); rhythmic control modulates from introspective to racing heart under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Each memory became a brushstroke"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise verbs/nouns; opening anchors stakes, closing recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mental alchemy reviving ghost town via no-opening bottle transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract conception dramatized as tactile labor heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
