<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's embodied nervousness via backward steps creates contradictory impulses that resolve forward at Marcus's return, earning the closure change. Marcus's thoughtful lines reveal credible endurance from exile. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("mentor resilience quietly means...") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from pacing/shadow to shimmer/materialization/reconfiguration, with Charged Poise closure in merging reflections and fading shadow bearing legible emotional cost of exile. Orientation anchors Elara/library early. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors constrain reflection/choice and charge final merging image; dust/silence/tea leaves filter through Elara's archivist bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to shadow's shimmer under climax urgency. Environment guides activation ritual purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversible mentoring via return) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through whisper-activation to materialization, narrowing anxiety to confidence with exile's marks as felt cost. Agency in Elara's handling/whisper forecloses exile path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resilience emerges organically from mirrors/tea leaves/exile particulars, reweighted non-literally in final "tender combat of growth" image without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of indirect teaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric/ reflective noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from anxious pacing to poised merge. Dialogue subtext-laden ("You banished me to save me"), distinct voices, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short activation sentences propel); high density integrates action/image. Minor overwriting in repeated "backward steps" and "geometry of tea leaves" risks paraphrase near climax but pattern-taught and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea leaves/shard-mirrors/reversible exile transforms mentoring trope into magical architecture with inevitable hindsight payoff in shadow fade/merge. Bold lyric risk heightens closure resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
