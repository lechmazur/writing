<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's methodical traits and repairer's ingenuity drive the pivot from stopping the hand to redirecting it, embodied in steady hands amid tremors and final collapse. Internal conflict emerges in failed attempts yielding to absurd insight without unearned epiphany. Minor flaw: occupation underused beyond metaphor, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tremors build density to pattern break via leaf sound, culminating in RR (hand freezes, station stabilizes) with legible cost in "chest heaving." Orientation anchored early (observatory, Kael, clock). Single scene coherent, no shards; pivotal lurch tests causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Biodome leaf and bioshell constrain climax choice, charging final clock image; tremors evolve spatially from shop to grove. Sensory hierarchy (sound of leaf amid roar) reflects repairer's ear. Micro-setting (tools crash) mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert orbital slip) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via worsening tremors and failed fixes narrowing to leaf gambit. Agency in restructuring forecloses brute-force path with bodily cost (heaving collapse). One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending via ephemeral (leaf fall reconfigures chaos) emerges organically from acts, resonating in final "echo of a leaf’s fall." Minor slip: end summaries ("restructured into beauty") border thematic echo, diluting ambiguity slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (lenses as "unshed tears"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "tick-tock-tock-TICK." Elevated diction consistent for sage's mind; no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density ("plucked string," "spiraling down in a slow, silent dance") in climax obscures propulsion (−0.7); minor paraphrase loops ("fragile" echoes, ache reprises). Rhythms vary but overwrites dull leaf pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absurd leaf-sound method transforms escape velocity into textural repair ingenuity, synthesizing sci-fi stakes with lyric ephemera. Risky premise (clock as thrust) feels inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
