<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt identity from experience is clear and consistent, driving observation and writing; interiority particular via quill and ledger imagery. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during shadow measurement, reducing peak pressure embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to shadow anomaly to chorus revelation. Closure as CR in fog melting and silence etching memory into Kael, with legible cost of lost clarity in final forecourt image. Two clean shards (observatory-forecourt) with legible transitions; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, solidified fog vividly constrain revelation—shadows defy sun via fog's timeline, charging final silent image. Sensory hierarchy (crunch of boots, humming echoes) reflects archivist priorities; details evolve causally with melt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve collective memory signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shadow mismatch tightening options and whispers deepening knowledge. Cost felt in fog dissolution foreclosing whispers, visible in dawn return and bittersweet smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of identity from collective experience emerges organically via particulars (shadows, whispers); final image reconfigures premise—memory etched beyond archives—with resonant ambiguity of future whispers. No moralizing; counter-reading lingers in preemptive nostalgia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: nostalgic-archivist lens filters fog as timeline holder. Prose texture modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in revelation); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-reflection; rhythm varies for hush buildup. Minor patterned repetition ("preemptively nostalgic" x3, "hush") teaches motif without loop, but synonym churn in whispers/descriptions dulls one mid-beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist in fog-captive time transforms memory trope via shadow-fog anomaly and crystal whispers. Risky lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
