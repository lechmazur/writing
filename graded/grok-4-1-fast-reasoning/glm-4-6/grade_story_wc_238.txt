<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation roots deeply in personal regret, driving micro-choices like the ladder climb and device use; internal conflict emerges in admissions during dialogue climax. Ghost's voice reveals flaws without stereotypes. Minor reflection anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: retrieval and device activation cause glow and dialogue, culminating in RR closure (spirit's peace) with emotional cost legible in "sorrow...dissolve...peace" and bottle's return. Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive's dust-trembling shelves and ladder constrain retrieval; orchard hush pressures timing, mirroring agitation. Sensory details (thrum, hum, blue glow) filter through Eloise's expertise, charging final shelf return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology/release) signals early, tightens via device success after past failures, forcing emotional trade-off in confessions. Agency in unconventional method narrows options; cost felt in mutual regret voiced at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge via release not erasure but transformation, resonating in final reflection without statement; recurring silence motif reweights past weight as bearable. Subtext in dialogue implies complexity over tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature ("gravel and starlight") biases toward ethereal expertise; dialogue subtext-laden, distinct (Eloise direct, ghost crackling/regretful). Stable distance modulates at glow/dialogue peak without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action with sensory propulsion; rhythm varies (short pulses at activation). Minor purple slips like "voice a mix of gravel and starlight" but no loops or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise ingeniously fuses supernatural with personal via induced currents; orchard demolition risks fresh stakes without gimmick. Final mending transforms ghost trope organically.</comment>
