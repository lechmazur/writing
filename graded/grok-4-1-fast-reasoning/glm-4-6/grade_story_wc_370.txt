<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between isolation and duty act simultaneously in the hide ritual and final decision, earning the closure choice with felt cost of facing chaos; interiority concrete via tactile tracing of invitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of paradoxes tightening to CR closure ("true tranquility comes not from hiding away"); orientation anchored early in library; cost legible in final step out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library micro-setting constrains hide ritual choices and charges final exit image; sensory details (dust motes, moonlight) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal paradoxes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (attend gathering) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clock and ritual to agency in departure; one deepening forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nested paradoxes emerge organically from particulars (library paradoxes, backstory mistake) to non-literal CR answer in final realization; resonance reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in paradoxical phrasing and rhythmic modulation (lyrical expansion to crisp resolve); stable close third-person limited with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "paradoxes" motif slightly dull peak density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recluse emergence via "staying while leaving" transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
