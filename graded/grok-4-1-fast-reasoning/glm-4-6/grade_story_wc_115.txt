<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between religious skepticism and ritualistic appraisal via psychic tapes, embodied in throat constriction mirroring tape's grief; final wheel-turn choice earned by prior confession cue. Minor unearned epiphany slip in "ghost shift" realization slightly abstracts motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from exploration to tape-wheel linkage, culminating in CR closure via wheel-turn releasing "swallowed truth" with legible cost ("weight...vanished...empty and light"). Orientation anchored early in tunnel; no shards, pattern coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's "throat of cold stone and damp air" and puddle-concealed wheel constrain discovery/turning choice and charge final open-valve image; sensory hierarchy (cold seeping jeans, ozone draft) mirrors internal pressure purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release guilt weight) signaled early via confession; accumulative tightening via wheel discovery/tape interpretation narrows to turning act with agency and on-page cost (burden lift leaving emptiness). Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt as "spectral factory" emerges organically from confession-wheel-tape pattern; final "shift...clocked out" image offers resonant CR reweighting unresolved energy into catharsis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (skeptical decay-not-prayer lens); rhythmic modulation builds to release sigh. Minor elevated diction slips in metaphors don't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "beads felt like tears frozen in time"); rhythm varies with pressure, no loops or scaffolds. Slight mixed metaphor density ("scalpel...throat") in opener withdraws minor propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of psychic tapes, beaded wheel as guilt valve, and factory ghost shift transforms abandoned-exploration trope into fresh CR; risk in ritual appraisal heightens stakes organically.</comment>
