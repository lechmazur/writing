<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synesthetic trait embodied concretely in "taste the sharpness of cyanide-blue and feel the warmth of golden-yellow," rooting motivation in consistent perceptual gift; mission intensifies credibly to compel singing. Lacks internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, reducing character depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from song to ice response; on-page Conceptual Repricing closure at "the ice... began to sing back" reconfigures wonder from pursuit to lived force with felt cost in sheet dimming and mission fulfillment. Orientation anchors early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices via synesthetic amplification, charging final image where "cavern’s song follow[ing] them like a cloak"; sensory details selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal states through refracting ice without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (amber sheet) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to ice's shimmer/tremble/song under protagonist agency in song; one deepening narrows options with visible cost in sheet's flare-to-dimming. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-as-essential emerges organically from particulars like aurora-song convergence, with final image "cavern’s hum lingered... awakened" offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in synesthetic weave avoids platitudes; complexity lingers in transformative hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("each echo... a stroke of violet"); rhythmic prose modulates from repose to urgency, diction controlled and voice-biased. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in sensory weave, but overwriting with figurative density ("kaleidoscope of sound and light," "cascade of resonant colors") in peak shimmer/tremble risks muddle without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "sculpted hush" purposeful but templated phrasing drags ("shifted shades... shifting shades"). Rhythm varies, no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, prism-song, and ice-unfettering transforms wonder trope into specific perceptual premise; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with closure's singing cavern inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
