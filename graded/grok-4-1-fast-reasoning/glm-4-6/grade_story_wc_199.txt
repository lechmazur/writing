<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's methodical traits and secret monument-building root consistent motivation, culminating in earned purpose shift; embodied reactions like "trembling hands" ground interiority. Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak emergence beat, just awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rituals density builds to prodding → emergence → specks-as-keys reconfiguration with conceptual cost of infinite responsibility. Closure RR/CR lands on-page in final monuments pulsing, reweighting premise; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring moonstone specks constrain prodding choice and charge final infinite-room image. Vivid, selective sensory integration (shimmer, pulse) through Elias's priorities; floating gardens subtly mirror lost memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding lost world) signaled early, tightens via emergence revelations narrowing to keeper role under accumulative lens. Protagonist agency in prodding/sorting forecloses sorter path with felt purpose cost; no reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-bridge emerges organically from specks unlocking acorns/monuments; final image resonantly reweights sorting as preparation without moralizing. Particulars like leaf-language script avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward seeds/leaves; poetic diction ("tweezers fashioned from fallen stars") fits fantasy voice, modulates to breathless in emergence. Minimal dialogue natural and advancing ("Thank you for awakening me").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulative beats; purposeful metaphors like "miniature lotus of pure light" enhance without muddling closure. Minor overwrite in stacked images ("eyes that held entire galaxies") near emergence, but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-sorting ritual into memory restoration transforms folklore trope; risk-taking in skyborne world's logic heightens closure stakes inevitably. No derivative echoes; bold final infinite-room reconfiguration.</comment>
