<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in avoidance yielding to compulsion at crystal forecourt; humming micro-choice earns shift with embodied finger-twitch memory. Backstory anchors via raindrop cues without flattening pressure. Minor epiphanic clarity ("sudden clarity") edges from concrete but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of whispers to RR closure in hand-on-crystal vibration reconfiguring dream as friend; cost legible in "heart fuller." Single scene anchors early, no orientation debt. Lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystals as micro-setting constrain avoidance and charge final touch with vibrations up arm; sensory hierarchy (percussive drops) filters via musician's ear. Details evolve with drying rain, mirroring internal thaw. Recurrent pillars ground spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via amplified drops forcing hum/renunciation; agency in bearing witness forecloses avoidance with felt emotional cost. One tightening suffices under lens. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation emerges from drop-notes vs. silence without statement; final forecourt visits reweight nostalgia non-literally. Particulars (piano memory in drops) avoid platitudes. Ambiguity lingers in ongoing listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sound-biased perceptual signature ("tiny percussive whispers") distinct and stable; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed hum. Third-limited distance consistent, no leakage. Poetic compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle" x2, "introverted clock scribe" x3) creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion, esp. in summary ending; minor template cadence in movement sentences. Density high but overwriting muddles some metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm varies but artifacts touch final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soundless sanctuary with raindrop orchestra transforms abandonment trope via specific crystal mechanics. Risk in lyric hush builds to inevitable peace image. No template echoes; voice commits to premise.</comment>
