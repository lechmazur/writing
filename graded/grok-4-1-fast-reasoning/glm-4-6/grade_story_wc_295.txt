<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's healing words concretely soothe the professor's grief in their exchange, embodying her trait under pressure; internal anxiety yields to shared resolve with felt relational cost. Professor applies immediate pressure via his secrecy. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("understanding dawned") avoids full contradictory impulses in peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations densify from witnessing professor to prophecy decoding, culminating in Charged Poise RR where collaboration reconfigures isolation with emotional cost legible in "burdens become lighter when witnessed." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored early via journals and worktable. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory's star charts constrain choice as professor rifles them, charging inciting incident; brass telescope and daylilies mirror internal solace amid anxiety. Sensory selectivity (moonlight gleam, clock strike) reflects Elara's celestial bias. Micro-setting (worktable photos) evolves with action without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding inscriptions tied to prophecy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via professor's revelation narrowing solo burden to shared one. Agency in Elara's careful approach forces stance crystallization; cost felt in grief-sharing alters tactics to joint decoding. No abstract stakes or unearned reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges organically from grief, prophecy, and collaboration without statement; final journal-closing image offers non-literal resonance reweighting isolation. Subtext in telegram's return implies legacy's weight. No moralizing or Thematic Echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable Elara POV with perceptual signature (dream clarity linking to stars); dialogue subtext-laden ("variable stars aren't just charts") pursues goals and distinguishes voices. Prose rhythm modulates from anxious to poised; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shaking hands" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for midnight tension to sunrise cadence. Minor paraphrase loop in "understanding dawned" repeats (−0.3); no filter stacks or template cadence in peak decoding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars as prophecy code, and word-healing transforms mentor grief trope organically. Risk in linking telegram/mother's garden to temple elevates beyond template celestial mystery. Irreplaceable particulars like daylilies charge closure without gimmickry.</comment>
