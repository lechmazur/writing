<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to prove empty spaces remember intensifies through embodied telescope grips and cloud-naming, rooted in father grief; interiority concrete via journal scribble, but emotions occasionally label-like ("grief, their silence"). Final endurance of suspension earns stasis with felt cost in knuckles-white clutch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in cloud circle and "The sky remembers everything," reweighting cable void with conceptual cost legible in fogged lens and landing jolt; orientation anchored early in gondola snap; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Telescope as micro-setting constrains choices (tracing sky wound, horizon focus) and charges final fogged image; sensory selectivity (wind hum, aluminum vibration) POV-biased via meteorological lens; gondola choreography clear in tilt/rotation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emptiness remembers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via drift lowering and pattern break in cirrus "scar," narrowing to realization; agency in categorizing forecloses denial with suspension cost felt in rotation/whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-wholeness emerges organically from cloud motifs shifting to cable ghosts; resonant CR in sky tapestry avoids moralizing until journal line "Empty spaces remember; they scream in silence," docking for mild thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (clouds as emotion); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from humming wind to lullaby, but minor register elevation in peak drift ("cerulean skin of memory") strains consistency; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure drift with stacked metaphors ("wound in cerulean skin," "spooled wholeness") and "quietly explosive" x4 create coherence drag/mixed vehicles (-0.7); paraphrase loops in cloud categorizations ("grief, melancholy") dull propulsion; rhythm varies but template stems recur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorologist's emotional cloud taxonomy in snapped-gondola drift transforms loss trope; cable-void proof via naming feels inevitable from particulars; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
