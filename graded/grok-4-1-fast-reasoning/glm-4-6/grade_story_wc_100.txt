<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's stubborn refusal to accept the lens as irreparable creates contradictory impulses acting in the basement scene, compelling higher-stakes dives; final nod to Mrs. Hargrove earns his partial reconfiguration with felt personal cost in elusive rest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal dives leading to accumulative resonance) holds through legible shard transitions like "Six weeks and three life-threatening diving expeditions later"; Charged Poise closure in lens rotation and spirit visit reconfigures stakes with Marcus's ongoing chase as undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater library dome with fish darting between shelves constrains dives and supplies the method, charging the liminal repair; sensory hierarchy (muffled stillness) reflects Marcus's perceptual priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair lens for souls) tightens via failed fusions to risky dives, narrowing options under Hybrid lens; life-threatening expeditions and "torn apart" sensation deliver visible agency-driven cost charging final beacon image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of elusive rest emerges organically from lens history and Marcus's arc, with final "coast is finally clear" whisper offering non-literal resonance reweighting his perpetual chase without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (spirit-seeing undertaker) biases details like "fractured like frozen lightning"; rhythmic modulation builds in liminal state without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action with images like "molecule by molecule"; minor overwriting in metaphors ("frozen lightning," "dissolving seafoam") purposeful but risks muddle in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker mysticism, drowned library, and impossible spaces transforms ghost tropes; risk-taking in multi-reality repair heightens stakes inevitably toward beacon closure.</comment>
