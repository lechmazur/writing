<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's shift from fort protector to revolution ally feels earned through discoveries, with embodied tension in the quill's cool metal drawing heat from her palm. Calmly inventive trait shown in aligning quill with sundial angles. Final panel decision reveals loyalty hierarchy with visible risk, though interior conflict could deepen contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sundial decoding therefore panel entry therefore chamber revelation as Charged Poise reconfiguration of blackout's meaning. Orientation anchors early (sentinel at luminous fort perimeter). Closure cost legible in Elena's nod accepting commander's corruption, foreclosing blind loyalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Half-painted sundial and pulsing stones constrain choices, charging discovery and descent. Twilight blackout narrows perception to torchlight and shadows purposefully. Glow-stone tech consistent, integrated via action without dumps; cradle chamber mirrors internal shift from darkness to illuminating truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fort protection vs. truth) tightens causally via sundial messages narrowing options to enter forbidden passage. Agency in quill-panel micro-choice forecloses safe duty with betrayal risk. Revelation reweights stakes, engineer's explanation landing earned escalation cost on loyalty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of corrupted light vs. shared illumination emerges organically from sundial codes to cradle recalibration. Final image of engineers transforming core stone offers resonant answer to vulnerability question. Subtext in whispers and silent wall parting avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward sentinel details like coded locks. Voice texture consistent in selective phrasing (e.g., "winking hush"). End dialogue natural, goal-driven revelation distinguishing engineer from Elena's prior suspicion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive quill holder mentions (≥5) create minor synonym churn across beats, dulling propulsion. Rhythm varies but template stems like "Elena [actioned]" recur in mid-section. Density high otherwise, with vivid integration in "placing the bronze quill holder into a recess."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fantasy sentinel decoding revolution via heirloom quill and blackout sundial transforms tropes through causal specificity. Cradle of sparks as power heart offers fresh synthesis on light/corruption. Risk in quiet revolution payoff heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
