<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jittery traits embodied early via satchel adjustments and thumb-tracing, transforming nervous energy into purposeful vibration; internal conflict between anxiety and legacy pressure resolves credibly in final movement shift. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("something had germinated in his understanding") lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonant encounters (hare, hermit) builds to CR closure in final paragraph's reconfiguration of legacy as living practice, with felt cost in foreclosed passive memory-preservation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (ridgeway, auroras, satchel). One tightening via storm-cave shard suffices; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain choices (shelter-seeking, sympathetic tracing), charging final image where pendant warms against chest. Sensory details selective (iridescent scales, liquid silver path) mirror internal resonance without catalog. Evolving mist/peaks/storm integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering wonder-weaving amid jitteriness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pendant's intensifying hum and hermit exchange narrowing to active legacy-carrying. Agency in micro-resonances forecloses routine delivery; cost legible in transformed gait. Lacks sharper trade-off in hermit beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing wonder from routine emerges organically via germinating encounters, culminating in non-literal CR ("bridge between memory and myth") reweighting mentor's absence. Subtext in pendant's reprise avoids statement; ambiguity lingers in timeless potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibrational noticing (hums with heartbeat, air shimmers); rhythmic prose modulates from jittery to poised. Hermit speech patterns align idiomatically without convergence. Clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density in resonant images, but paraphrase loops ("germinate" thrice, "vibrating sympathetically" recurs without new pressure) dull mid-section; minor template cadence in reflective beats ("had learned," "had never"). Rhythm varies, metaphors coherent (liquid silver, ripples in time).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sympathetic magic via dragonfly pendant transforms legacy trope; ridge-to-myth arc risks lyric accumulation successfully, heightening stakes in routine-vs-wonder calculus. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early vibrations.</comment>
