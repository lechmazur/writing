<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied touches like "fingers along the feather’s vanes," revealing motivation rooted in lifelong pursuit; micro-choices like weaving string and feather earn transformation with felt cost of impermanence. Contradictory impulses in mending vs. leaving to tide act simultaneously in final beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and pattern of mending build to Charged Poise closure; kite string snap tightens via motivated lunge and weaving, reconfiguring incomplete into fleeting beauty with conceptual cost legible in "sculpture would be claimed by the water."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and POV-biased (petrichor, plinks from fronds, iridescent shifts); lagoon and tide constrain choices, charging final image as ripples mirror poet's focus and advance claims sculpture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through feather-to-sculpture progression narrowing to acceptance of dissolution; cost felt in tide's "slow and inexorable" advance forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via discord emerges organically from weaving action and final image of sculpture-to-water; resonant non-literal answer in "leaving the feather and string to the lagoon" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("captured twilight," "woven dawns"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to completion hum, heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "feather’s rigid structure met the string’s flexibility" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm flows read-aloud, zero loops, purposeful figurative integration without muddle in peak weaving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drake feather and kite string into transformative sculpture left to tide; risk-taking in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes of impermanence, feeling inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
