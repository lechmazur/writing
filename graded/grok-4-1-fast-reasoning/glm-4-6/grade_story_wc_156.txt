<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's traits shown concretely in "methodically playful" brushwork and micro-choice to trace nickel, earning her final art shift; minimal contradictory impulses limit peak complexity, but change forecloses prior certainty with felt cost in changed perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup to CR closure—"she saw it differently... music waiting to be heard"—with undeniable conceptual cost in traded certainty; orientation anchored early in chapel, shards transition legibly via shimmer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's crystalline petals and echoing flowers constrain touch/approach, charging final image of humming chapel; sensory hierarchy (heard/felt over seen) reflects Elara's awakening, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through three awakenings narrowing options; cost legible in "didn’t need it" tether renunciation, but lacks sharper agency trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-over-certainty emerges via particulars like lily-mural reflection, resonant CR in final brushwork without moralizing; man's "trade what we know" echoes organically, inviting ambiguity in "pause holds a universe."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (sound-as-form bias) stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual—"You seek to exchange"—advances awakening; rhythm modulates from precise restoration to symphonic crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "boots crunched on crystalline petals that chimed"; purposeful metaphors consistent in lyric mode, minor overwriting in garden bloom strings doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hobo nickel-to-sound-garden portal synthesizes restoration magic with fresh sonic landscape; risk in nested surrealism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "every pause holds a universe."</comment>
