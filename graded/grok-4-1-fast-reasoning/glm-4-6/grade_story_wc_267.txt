<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bellhop's motivation to understand safety's cost drives concrete actions like kneeling at the discoloration and unlocking the piano; embodied reactions (heart raced, hands trembled) ground interiority during discovery. Internal conflict subtle but present in defiance amid enforced silence. Earned endurance at close ("He would remain") forecloses ignorance with personal cost of impending regeneration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: silence anomaly → discoloration → bolt → ledger discovery → realization, under Hybrid Causal-Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored early ("cobalt fortress under snow"). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with cost legible in "nerve regeneration would come for him too," reconfiguring his silence as weapon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (sharpened hearing for snow crunch/drips, fogging breath, thin air) filter through POV and constrain ascent (colder west wing narrows focus). Recurring dust/cold mirrors internal shift, charging final image of "cobalt walls seemed lighter." Micro-setting (staircase smudge) guides pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand safety's cost) signaled early, tightens via ledger reveal narrowing options from curiosity to armed endurance. Agency in investigation forces trade-off: knowledge vs. personal erasure risk. Cost felt in final stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-erasure emerges organically from piano/ledger to bellhop's reconfiguration ("silence now a weapon"). Final image ("heart full of cold, quiet fire") offers resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of frostbitten hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (hyper-acute hearing biasing details); voice texture (lyric diction like "seraphically mundane") modulates rhythmically without head-hopping. No dialogue. Purposeful compression in ascent pays off at discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (silence/dust) building texture; rhythm varies (short sentences in discovery: "He pocketed the bolt."). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("steps swirling like clouds") but coherent, no loops obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent-choir premise, bolt-as-key mechanism, and fortress erasure transforms isolation tropes; risk-taking in poetic voice heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration ("dawn he couldn’t yet see") feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
