<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Singular motivation rooted in weathered resolve drives attunement shift, embodied in palm-thrum of arrowhead; earned endurance forecloses physical movement with isolation's conceptual cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via arrowhead vibrations to birds' patterns, landing CR in final reconfiguration of towers from prison to resonant chambers; cost legible in "no longer seeing them as bars."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain harmonic perception, charging final image as "resonant chambers"; selective sensory filter (vibrations over sight) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate without moving) deepens via appraisal reversal—arrowhead's pulse reweights isolation into mastery; agency in focused attunement, felt cost in foreclosed paths crystallized at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-attunement emerges from particulars (dust-ink, bird-spaces); final skipping stone offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via arrowhead vessel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibratory "songs," "frequencies"); rhythmic modulation peaks in bird-vortex, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; minor metaphor density in bird passage ("thrown ink," "vortex") purposeful for textural lens without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic skimming via birds/echoes transforms isolation trope; risk in non-causal attunement heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via arrowhead pulse.</comment>
