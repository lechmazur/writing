<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in consistent traits drives higher-stakes choices like ignoring converging shadows; interiority concrete in "heart hammered, but hands remained steady." Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, mostly focused resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore: key insertion spins gears, star corrections widen fissure therefore summon shadows, final rune alignment seals loops with DC/CR. Closure cost legible in "Exhausted, slumped" and "world remained broken." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nocturnal observatory's vents enable shadow incursion constraining climax choice; lens focuses fissure charging final image of drifting isle. Sensory details (glowing runes, writhing shadows) vivid and POV-filtered by rune priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend world via shadows' path) tightens causally when "star chart glitched, uncorrected patterns feeding the shadow’s strength," forcing palm slam with agency. Cost unmistakable in hot key and exhaustion charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken reality via balanced loops emerges organically from rune mirroring and shadow exile; final "shadows would have to find another place to hide" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rune-focused noticing); voice modulates rhythm under stress, e.g., short "Adjust" amid precise control dancing. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in peak: "Slammed her palm... loops sealed"; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density ("liquid smoke") in opener but purposeful, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune mechanics and shadow exile transforms fantasy tropes; "spoons bent reality" infuses originality, with loops' inevitability heightening stakes organically.</comment>
