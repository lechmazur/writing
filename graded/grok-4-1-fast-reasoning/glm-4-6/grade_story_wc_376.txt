<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's wilting skin patterns provide exceptional embodied emotion and contradictory impulses, compelling her choices from discovery to confrontation. Final drafting of messages earns a meaningful change with visible cost (permanent wilt). Marius's honesty as foil applies clean pressure without headcount overload.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of discoveries (map → plate → truths), culminating in CR closure where messages reconfigure candor with conceptual cost of lost lives. Orientation anchors early (Elara in domes). Mosaic shards taught via workspace refrain; legible transitions build to on-page tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse domes, iridescent dust, postal tubes constrain choices (floorboards hide map, ruins yield plate) and charge final image of blooming candor under toxic sky. Sensory filter (leaf-like skin, artificial lamps) reflects Elara's priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost conversations' fate) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through reread fragments revealing council lies, forcing stance shift to broadcast truths. Agency in piecing/rereading forecloses denial with on-page cost (wilted skin endures). Moral calculus (truth vs panic) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of candor vs withheld truths emerges organically from skin wilts, intercepted mail, and final broadcast, offering resonant non-literal answer: truths bloom despite permanent scars. No moralizing; complexity lingers in half-truth costs. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (truth-sensitive skin filters world); voice modulates poetically yet concretely. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You knew"), goal-driven (confession triggers gold return). No head-hopping; diction fits calligrapher's sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "skin patterns would wilt" embodies stakes/sets rule). Rhythms vary for pressure; minor overwriting in opening metaphors purposeful for tone. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wilting calligrapher + zinc plates of silenced mail transforms eco-dystopia tropes via truth-physiology link; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risky mosaic of discoveries heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; premise commits fully to postal ghosts.</comment>
