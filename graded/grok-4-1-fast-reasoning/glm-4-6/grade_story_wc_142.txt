<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in dual allegiance intensifies compellingly to graffiti network and final evolution, with traits like orderly intuition enabling pattern-spotting. Interiority concrete in tactile stone chip handling and wavering hope amid barges. Internal conflict acts via weaving preservation/progress, earned in solstice adaptation without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from foggy morning insight to graffiti expansion and solstice Charged Poise closure, with felt cost in perpetual mission. Orientation anchored early in raft carnival. One tightening via network coordinating resistance suffices; summary shards legible without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (neon flickering, glow paint, artificial snow) filtered through Mara's priorities guides graffiti choices and mirrors buoyancy. Raft undersides constrain method; stone chip charges final moonlight image. No white-room; evolves with privatization shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve carnival amid gentrification) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via graffiti armor forcing prepared stances at consultations. Agency in reorganization forecloses chaos path with cost in wavering hope ("hope waver") amid barges. Escalation coheres to solstice curiosity reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilient weaving emerges organically from graffiti network transforming decay to armor, answered non-literally in developers' curiosity and moonlight-veined stone. Complexity in hopeful desperation avoids binaries. Final image recharges motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeing (gossip currents, tides of opinion). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic lyricism ("shifting hues of hope and decay"). Elevated diction consistent, modulates with pressure to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in read-aloud peaks like solstice finale. No loops or scaffolds; figuratives purposeful ("lapping... shoals"). Minor overwriting in "buoyant chaos" cluster but coherent, not muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft carnival graffiti code transforms gentrification trope via visual language resistance. Risky accumulative compression heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Final stone reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
