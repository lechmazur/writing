<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in deciding to fuse the imperfect coin despite alchemical failures, embodied in "tremor in his chest" and micro-choice of whispering Lyra's name as formula; earned renunciation of perfect symmetry with visible emotional cost at scales settling. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coin wobble to gold fusion, landing Conceptual Repricing closure in "golden scar a map of what had been broken and what had been rebuilt" with felt cost of honored fracture; oriented early in foundry post-search party, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Foundry micro-setting constrains choices (scales, melting pot, bellows enable fusion) and charges final image (steam silhouette, scales settle); sensory selection (sulfur, rain rhythm, steam shimmer) reflects alchemical urgency and POV bias, evolving causally with heat bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem via understanding loss) signaled early, tightens texturally through deepening realization during fusion ("not to restore it but to honor its fracture"); agency in bellows work and stepping out forecloses symmetry path with legible regret cost in exhaling closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance in opposites emerges organically from coin fusion and final image ("holding opposites until they made something new"), reweighting premise without statement; resonant ambiguity in Lyra's potential return lingers via kintsugi scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical lens: "distilling emotions into elixirs"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged fusion sentences, diction biased to mystical precision without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion, but figurative density overloads peak fusion beat ("embers glowed...shard of broken intention") risks coherence; no loops, clean syntax, purposeful overwriting mostly taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of literal kintsugi alchemy with zodiac coin transforms loss trope; risk in fusing heirloom honors fracture uniquely, inevitable in hindsight from scales tipping.</comment>
