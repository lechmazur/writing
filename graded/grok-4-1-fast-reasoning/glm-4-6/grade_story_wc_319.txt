<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory urge to shatter pendant versus purpose of befriending uncertainty acts in scene, with embodied ache flaring at "his homesickness flared"; final integration earns renunciation of destruction with dimensional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of internalization builds to Charged Poise closure; pendant disturbance and softening reconfiguration land on-page with legible conceptual cost in "boundaries of light did not dissolve, but they learned to bend."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden's mist and glass-rose constrain waiting vigil and pendant nesting, mirroring internal fog; sensory ozone and frost charge final ivy-draped integration, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pendant's vortex certainty violates foggy domain, deepening stake via endurance; agency in directing attention narrows options, with cost unmistakable in softened spinning and warmed ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emergent theme of uncertainty as companion reweights via pendant's dimming star and bent boundaries; final image resonantly answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with foggy perceptual signature ("nuances beyond sight") and rhythmic modulation sustains under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in internalization beats; figurative consistency (vortex to ivy) without muddle or loops sharpens closure image of "resonant frequency."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-library guardian internalizing belief-vortex transforms abstract homesickness into graceful reconfiguration; risk in abstract lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
