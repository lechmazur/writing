<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "creeping normality noticer's instinct" drives consistent observation to action, with micro-choices like displacements revealing values; interiority concrete via perceptual signatures like "missing heartbeat," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to shard touch ("world fell silent... auditory gold") tightening to CR closure in attic placement and house's "groan with... pleasure"; cost legible in structural response reweighting theory, on-page anchors clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orris shard and teacup constrain choices (touch unleashes rattling, steam curls as offering) and charge final attic image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (violet scent vs salt air, low hum), integrated via goal-directed handling; recurring streetlights evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken house vitality) signaled early, textural escalation via shard-deepening ("house's breathing intensified") narrows to displacement agency foreclosing inaction; cost felt in house's responsive "groan," coherent under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of living houses emerges via particulars like migrating objects to final "hushed blaze" reweighting premise without statement; resonant CR answers "why some houses... hum" through displacement image, ambiguity in "secrets to keep or share" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("vibrancy... dimmed imperceptibly"); rhythmic modulation peaks at shard ("compressed magnitude... auditory gold"), diction biased to house-life (e.g., "walls sigh"); no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in lines like "steam curling... violet fingerprint scent," rhythm varies (short punchy actions amid lyric swells); minor overwrite in repeated streetlights motif purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling shard beat or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of domestic animism via "displaced objects" doctrine transforms trope organically; risk in lyric voice heightens perceptual stakes, attic placement feels inevitable from early instinct.</comment>
