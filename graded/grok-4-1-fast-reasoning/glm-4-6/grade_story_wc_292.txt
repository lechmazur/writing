<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in trembling hand and wavering resolve at console hesitation, with contradictory impulses (expose vs. preserve) driving the climax choice; motivation rooted in ancestor honor compels higher-stakes twist. Minor label-speak in repeated "nervously confident" slightly abstracts peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression: nail placement prompts console query, whisper answer reveals containment, twist enacts CR closure retrieving nail with burden cost legible in final pocket and step out. Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully at twist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's recycled air and groaning systems constrain isolation; copper nail as micro-setting evolves (cold to warm) charging final pocket image. Sensory narrowing under crisis (shimmered air, blared alarms) mirrors resolve, with horizon patterns pivotal to awe realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor via nail) tightens causally at hesitation then twist, narrowing to endurance accepting burden cost; agency in alignment forecloses exposure path. Climax glimpse forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent preservation emerges organically from journal warning and twist choice, reweighted in final stabilization image without moralizing; ancestor's bravery reconfigured via Elias's acceptance. Subtext in console lines ("TO OPEN...STORM") invites ambiguity on discovery's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (spongey dread in air) and rhythmic modulation under stress; diction selective (geometric patterns). No dialogue; minor repetition risks uniformity but texture coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("nervously confident" x3, "spongey dread" x3) creates template cadence in opening and hesitation beats, dulling propulsion; minor synonym churn on emotions. Rhythm varies elsewhere, density high in console exchanges.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer's containment field unlocked by coffin nail transforms isolation trope; risk in poetic console pays off in CR closure. Non-obvious map-within-map ingenuity drives turns organically.</comment>
