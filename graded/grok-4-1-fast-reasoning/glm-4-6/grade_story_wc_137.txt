<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic trait roots choices like lifting the tile despite doubt, with embodied warmth and visions showing internal conflict; final change to "quiet certainty" earned via prior immersion. Minor label-speak ("courageously kind nature") slightly abstracts embodiment without peak harm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from hum/tile trace to memory cascade/transcription, yielding Charged Poise CR at "world felt a little less heavy" with legible emotional cost of stripped doubt. Single scene anchors orientation early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tile as micro-setting constrains tracing/transcribing and charges closure reprise; tower's open roof/whale songs selectively mirror immersion, with hum/light evolving causally. Sensory hierarchy fits POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village reflection via memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tile visions narrowing skepticism to empathy; agency in tracing/transcribing forecloses doubt with heart "heavy yet light." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory/compassion emerges via tile visions/whale-song motif shifting to "greatest magic," but final line "compassion was the greatest magic of all" moralizes explicitly, diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual bias (skeptic to empathetic noticing); rhythmic modulation peaks in "cascade of light and sound." Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early via hum/symphony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("transcribe," "unheard symphony") charging motif, but minor paraphrase loops ("transcribed the essence... transcribe with her life") and repeated endings dull propulsion slightly; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism synthesis of tile/memories/whales transforms loss tropes via pattern-tracing syntax; risk in lyric immersion pays off at empathetic closure without gimmickry.</comment>
