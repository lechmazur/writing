<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation build to earned reconfiguration, with acoustically perceptive trait constraining choices like enduring the hush. Minor slip in "realized she had found her answer" borders unearned epiphany, but prior bleeding fingers and tear ground it. Final endurance of imperfection shows contradictory grief/renewal impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hum to final melody, culminating in Charged Poise CR where hush reconfigures as canvas with cost of unfinished beauty legible in sapling's partial unfurl. Single scene anchors early (Lyra in greenhouse post-fire by para 2). No orientation debt; closure cost visible in "beauty of imperfection."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fractured dome, shipwrecks, and sapling constrain acoustic perception and charge final image (glass hues, leaves catching light). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hush as disharmonious tone). Setting evolves causally with mist, wind, sun, mirroring renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind hush) escalates via textural density: bowl tremble, spoken story narrow to final play crystallizing stance. Agency in micro-choices (hum into bowl, speak tale) forecloses grief-only path with cost of "things left undone" felt in tear and sapling. Coherent pressure under lens, one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal in ruin emerges organically from particulars (burned forest to singing bowl/sapling), reweighted in final image without moralizing. Subtext in "endings were just beginnings in disguise" earned via struggle, offering resonant non-literal answer to hush's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, with acoustic perceptual signature (hush as "tone without harmony") modulating rhythmically under grief's pressure. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught early; diction reflects embodied state without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/action (e.g., "bow gliding effortlessly... echoed each note"). Minor overwriting in metaphor strings like "ash over the world" coherent but thickens early; no loops, artifacts, or muddle touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire lyricism with shipwrecks/orchard as renewal stage; risk in poetic hush-as-canvas reweights tropes organically. Bowl's echo-harbor evolves non-obviously from alms to story-vessel.</comment>
