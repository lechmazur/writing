<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via symphonic metaphors and embodied grief tightening like polymer chains; micro-choices like tracing foam reveal values under pressure. Final polymer variant earns change from prior causality with felt cost in loosened grief. Minor slip: epiphany feels slightly unearned before foam-tracing insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure where chrysalis pockets as charged image reconfigures patent dilemma with conceptual cost in metamorphosis. Orientation anchored early (chemist at ravine); one tightening via foam insight narrows options. Cost legible in "grief... began to loosen."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ravine braids and foam constrain insight choice, mirroring polymers; chrysalis charges final image as pocketed reminder. Sensory details (moss-covered stones, sunlight through canopy) selective via POV bias, integrated into action. No white-room; evolves with reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patent vs. family) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via foam patterns deepening to variant synthesis; agency in realization forecloses rigid path. Cost felt in grief loosening, charging lab shard. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of synthesis from separation emerges organically via foam/ravine images shifting to connection; final Marco smile resonates non-literally. Murmured line ("divergent path isn't a choice... but a synthesis") borders thematic echo, softening peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with symphonic perceptual signature (molecular melodies, foam harmonics); rhythmic prose modulates from rigid to fluid. No head-hopping; diction controlled, biased to chemist's lens. Experimental metaphor density taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors purposeful (foam rejoins/separates) without muddle in insight beat. Minor paraphrase loop in foam descriptions (−0.4), but pattern-taught for accumulative lens. Clean syntax, varied rhythm supports cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh polymer-ravine-foam synthesis transforms epiphany trope via specific symphonic lens; chrysalis risk heightens metamorphosis stakes organically. No templates; core premise (ethical bridge) feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
