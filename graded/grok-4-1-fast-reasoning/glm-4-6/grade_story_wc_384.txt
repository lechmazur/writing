<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly through thorn's blood-drop embodiment, rooting revenge in family betrayal; internal conflict layers justice/forgiveness without tidy resolution. Minor flaw: occasional diagnostic phrasing like "calibrated treason had become her form of worship" borders therapy-speak but anchors closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from prep to seal-pricking DC/CR, cost legible in "joints protesting" endurance and cycle-breaking emergence. Orientation anchors immediately in sanctuary/aurora; single scene tightens to Charged Poise without slips touching ending image of unlinking steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora shifts and stalactite drips constrain pacing/tactics, charging final daylight emergence; cold marble embodies endurance cost on "joints protesting" line. Sensory filter (acoustics absorb weeping) biases via POV urgency, no white-room—vivid, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgery unlinks inheritance/vengeance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tedious replication to blood-seal tightening; agency in pricking/drop forecloses bitterness with felt physical/emotional price. No reversal needed, but abstract "forgive unfinished" softens peak cost legibility slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of deception-as-worship emerges organically from forgery acts and thorn reprise, reweighting treason via "holy act of deception" image without stating moral. Resonant CR in emergence unlinks past/future; ambiguity lingers in Valerius reaction without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light/memory interplay); rhythmic modulation peaks in "aurora rippled... dream and reality" without drift. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("wisely endured" x2, "unlink" x4, "heritage rose thorn" x5) create paraphrase churn across middle, dulling density without pattern payoff; minor template cadence in motivation summaries. Closure image propels cleanly despite artifacts not touching final emergence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery-as-revenge-worship in aurora-lit sanctuary transforms trope via ink/thorn specificity; risk in "treason" moral calculus heightens stakes organically. No close template echoes, voice commits to lyrical fantasy realism.</comment>
