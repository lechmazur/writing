<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between order and chaos culminates in earned hesitation before pulling the lever; embodied emotions like "cold seeping through the fabric" reveal character under pressure. Final change feels motivated by prior destabilization. Minor stock phrasing in early reflection slightly limits perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density (frost, whispers) building to CR closure in the press burst and leap, reweighting eternity with legible cost ("perfect systems collapsing"). Orientation anchored early in glass orchard. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard and cloud-sea constrain choices (fragile sanctuary, edge leap) and charge final image; sensory details like "translucent fruit glowing" filtered through Elias's priorities mirror destabilization. Vivid, purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape eternity's cage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via frost warnings and bottle to lever-pull agency; cost unmistakable in unraveling and leap. One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rupture freeing stasis emerges organically from frost messages and final leap reweighting "rustling awakenings" from warnings to promises; resonant without moralizing. Particulars like bottled whisper drive insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with surreal perceptual signature (ink-stained hands holding night); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure at press slam. Purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful image recurrence (rustling, frost) without loops or muddle. "Iron meeting paper with a crack like thunder" propels climax cleanly. Minor dense metaphors don't obscure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress defiance against surreal entropy in glass orchard; rupture leap risks bold reconfiguration, inevitable from established patterns. Transformation elevates tropes.</comment>
