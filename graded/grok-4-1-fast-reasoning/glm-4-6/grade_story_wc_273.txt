<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via serene anger embodied in precise actions like tracing fading patterns; final tempering of anger earned by ink's revelation with felt cost of acceptance. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("beauty resided even in disappearance") borders on unearned but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns build density to CR closure where realization reweights time as mental battle against oblivion, cost legible in "anger tempered by the revelation" and wind-erased traces. One tightening via coalescing map suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment and scorched earth constrain path to ridge and charge final image as wind erases ink, mirroring theme. Sensory details (crunching boots, whirring drone) selective via Kael's pattern bias; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time in crisis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as ink forms then dissolves map, forcing realization with conceptual cost of transience. Agency in spilling/tracing forecloses ignorance; cost unmistakable in fading patterns under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time's elasticity emerges organically from ink patterns and eclipse, final image of Kael vanishing into shadows offers resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars like drone's chirps layer subtext of companionship in ephemerality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-chasing (e.g., "fleeting as they were intricate"); lyrical rhythm modulates from measured steps to lighter ones, fitting accumulative lens. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor template cadence in repeated "Kael [action]" stems (stood, followed, knelt, traced, stood) across early beats dulls rhythm slightly; no loops touch closure image of wind-whispered belonging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi drone/ink alchemy revealing psychological time secret post-eclipse; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of disappearance without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via ephemeral patterns.</comment>
