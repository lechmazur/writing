<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via chess-specific habits like tracing patterns and shifting the pawn, embodying guilt as phantom pieces; final choice earned by prior causality confronting past arrogance on the platinum board. Minor summary in "lives he had ruined" slightly abstracts emotional cost without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of hush, thunder, and platforms builds to Charged Poise closure when labyrinth dissolves after pawn shift, with felt cost in memory flash. Orientation anchored early in village; single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Platinum corridors pulsing light and shifting platforms constrain navigation choices; recurring thunder/hush mirror internal storm, charging final rain image where guilt lifts. Sensory hierarchy (muffled steps, metallic air) reflects strategic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake tightens accumulatively via labyrinth logic narrowing options, culminating in agency on stalemate board foreclosing guilt path with visible cost. Escalation coherent under lens, though internal pressure dominates over external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of atonement through masterful gambit emerges organically from chess-labyrinth parallel, reweighted in final image of stilled fidgets and lifted weight without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like crimson thread to pawn sacrifice avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in strategic fidget-patterns and guilt-filtered thunder; rhythmic modulation peaks in "fierce repose" at board study. Voice texture chess-infused and consistent, eliding no key facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in navigation beats; minor overwrite in repeated "fierce repose" and "fidgets productively" creates slight template cadence but doesn't obscure closure pawn shift. No loops dulling image; rhythm supports accumulative hush lift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess redemption in platinum grid-labyrinth, with risk-taking in time-frozen hush transforming guilt into solitaire game; pawn sacrifice feels inevitable from early threads.</comment>
