<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in "heart pounding with a steely longing" and "chest tight with anticipation" embodies emotion particular to a pianist's tactile world, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final peace feels earned via micro-choices like threading the reel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as arbor's light density reveals film map, synchronizing to clock for RR closure (clock ticks forward with felt anticipatory cost in "world itself held its breath"); orientation anchors early in station scene; single tightening via alignment suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor's "luminescent flora flickered like lanterns" and tidal surge constrain choices (reveal map, lift him) and charge final dimming lights; sensory selectivity (salt, bioluminescence) mirrors urgency without catalog; spatial choreography tracks ascent to clock cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewrite time via clock) signaled early tightens accumulatively as compasses steady and gears turn, narrowing to hands-pressing agency with chest-tight cost; no reversal needed, but deepening forces stance crystallization in peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fate's flexibility emerges organically from film-clock sync and final tick-forward image reweighting "surprise fate"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "reminded it of its own flexibility" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("final chord," "unplanned encore") and rhythmic modulation under stress; diction controlled, lyric compression legible from opening haze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in "unspooled the film reel, threading it through a makeshift projector" advances action+image; minor figurative density ("day bled into night") in opener but purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film reel encoding clock blueprint in tidal arbor's light transforms time trope via pianist's ingenuity; risk in magical rules (tides manipulate time) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
