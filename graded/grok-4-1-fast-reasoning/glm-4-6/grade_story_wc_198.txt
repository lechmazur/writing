<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to disrupt the prophecy via negative space feels rooted in his musician's grasp of silence, embodied in strategic pauses during play; endurance of ongoing burden shows earned stasis with cost. Interiority particularized through sensory ties like dewdrops on forehead. Minor reflection slips in backstory block don't flatten pressure, as they anchor present choice before prism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of notes, silences, and light builds to pattern break in "subtle change in the atmosphere" with birdsong signaling success; Charged Poise closure reconfigures prophecy as "held at bay" with legible cost of eternal vigilance. Orientation anchored early in path/descent. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium as recurring micro-setting constrains play by scattering notes into light web, charging final dewdrops reflecting Elias's "older... etched" face. Sensory hierarchy musician-specific: sound/light primacy amid damp stone/mist. Vivid, purposeful integration without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert prophecy completion) signaled early, escalates via "critical" morning and final note due; one tightening in felt atmospheric shift narrows to success under Accumulative lens. Agency in deliberate silences forecloses completion path; ongoing ritual cost visible in closing reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory preserved via "music designed to be forgotten" emerges organically from prophecy hush and negative space; final image of unaware town reweights premise with Elias's burden as non-literal answer. Resonance from particulars like coded sheet music, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in musical noticing (notes fracturing light); prose rhythm modulates from hushed build to poised close, mirroring stakes. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, lyrical without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each note weighted with purpose" advances plot/character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful recurrence of dewdrops/prism. Propulsion peaks in "shift before he heard it," clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical prophecy coded in notes/holes, countered by silences; negative space as tactic transforms trope organically. Risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens eerie ingenuity without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight via prism web.</comment>
