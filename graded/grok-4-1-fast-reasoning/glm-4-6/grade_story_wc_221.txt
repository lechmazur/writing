<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in family loss and pariah status compel the shift from isolation to cartographer, with embodied actions like tracing the compass and adapting the sketch showing contradictory impulses. Final endurance of exile feels earned with visible cost in alchemized purpose. Minor overt labeling of "blessed pariah" slightly abstracts peak insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sketch to shimmer ("a flicker at the edge") to ghost sky insight, culminating in CR closure via aligned maps reconfiguring stability with felt isolation cost. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via glimpse suffices. Lens taught early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (cool metal, charcoal scratch, plasteel) filter through Elias's expertise, with deck bubble constraining eternal seconds for drawing and charging final alignment. Recurring compass and window evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. 9+ gate met: setting enables ghost sight pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map temporal ruins, turn confusion to purpose) signaled early, tightens via glimpse narrowing to ghost charting under accumulative lens, with agency in adaptive drawing foreclosing passive survival. Cost legible in "echoing silence" lessening to alive potential. Minor abstractness in initial mantra slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing loss emerges organically via custom's evolution from remembrance to discovery, with final maps offering resonant CR answer reweighting curse as compass. Subtext in silence motif shifts without moralizing. Particulars like ghost Orion avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward temporal anomalies; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from stretched silence to defiant scratch. Perceptual signature shines in "ghost in the machine of spacetime." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying openings and lengths; metaphors like "taffy" and "black velvet" cohere atmospherically without muddle in peak shimmer beat. Minor simile density early and silence repetition build tone without loops. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal cartography via family sketch and compass true north transforms isolation trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes; insight ("true north wasn’t a fixed point") feels inevitable from particulars. No derivatives.</comment>
