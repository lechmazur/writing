<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in seeding innovation, shown through calculated writing; however, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with smooth interiority more declarative than embodied (e.g., "groundedly imaginative" label without tense tradeoff). Final confidence feels earned but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pause to writing to world response (lake cracks/thaws); resonant reconfiguration closure via thawing lake reweights ignorance as map with conceptual cost of sown transformation legible in final descent. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via quill's dance suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake vividly constrain climb/isolation and charge final thaw image, mirroring internal craft; sensory selection (glassy reflections, echo stairs) purposeful and POV-biased toward precision. Evolves causally with writing, guiding choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping constrained innovation signaled early, escalates texturally via ink flow/world hum/crack to Charged Poise closure; agency in quill strokes forecloses blank ignorance with felt conceptual cost. One deepening (pause to completion) narrows to transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of innovation-from-constraint emerges organically via particulars (ink arcs, bone cities); final thawing image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in nudge-vs-dictate implication sustains ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (metaphors as lens); rhythmic modulation builds intensity from whisper stairs to dancing quill. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short pause breaths to flowing ink); high density but minor paraphrase loops on quill/ignorance (e.g., repeated "quill trembled/sensed/paused") dull propulsion slightly. Metaphors coherent, no muddle in peak writing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer-as-planner transforms prophetic trope via grounded lyricism; risk in symbolic world-response (spire hums, lake gasps) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from feather-to-fabric weave.</comment>
