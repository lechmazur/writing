<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in naming amid resurfacing memories ("ignored them, focusing on the page"), earning the final renunciation of taking the page with visible emotional cost; interiority particular and embodied throughout, with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of naming and memories builds to Charged Poise closure ("pain more tangible, more real"); orientation anchored immediately ("ancient observatory loomed"); cost legible in "He reached for the page, but stopped."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's cracked light constrains the method ("light through the dome fractured into tiny prisms") and charges final image ("crystallized monsters left behind, glittering"); sensory details selective and POV-biased, evolving with grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through successive namings, narrowing denial into tangible pain; agency in whispers forecloses suppression with felt cost, though escalation subtle rather than sharply reversal-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-through-naming emerges organically from particulars, reweighting sacrifice in final image ("echo of sacrifice had become a lullaby") without statement; resonant non-literal closure to "Don't forget me."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractured vowels, lover's sigh); rhythmic modulation under pressure coherent, though minor elevated diction slips in peaks; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, with varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("curling like frozen flames") in peak naming slightly overloads without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper myth with crystallizing grief via atlas monsters feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric naming ritual heightens stakes organically.</comment>
