<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of grief through mournfully eager persistence, with contradictory impulses in "grief sharp-edged but driven" compelling the climax choice; micro-choices like pressing closer under strain reveal values with visible cost; interiority concrete and particular, no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from roar/hum to vibration/chime to motes release as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt physical/emotional cost in "arm burning...couldn't stop"; orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coheres to charged closure image of motes drifting home.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's echo chamber and concrete constrain tactics (focus on dark patch, wall sighs), charging final cascade; sensory hierarchy (sound primacy, damp earth/dust) reflects POV urgency; micro-setting (blower/tool) shapes choices, mirroring internal shatter with "shimmering residue."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates via density increase (vibration to "tiny, crystalline tinkling") under Accumulative lens, narrowing to desperate chant; agency in endurance forecloses quitting with on-page cost ("pull cord...slick with sweat"); cost unmistakable in climax strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-presence emerges organically from particulars (laughter embedded in walls, motes sinking into home); final image reconfigures silence as "gentle, constant presence" without moralizing; subtext in unconventional method invites ambiguity on grief's alchemy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (grief-honed seeing residue); rhythmic modulation peaks in "Find it, find it, find it" chant; purposeful poetic compression legible under lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates to climax ("shimmering motes...crushed a diamond"); minor metaphor pile in opening ("wound...ghosts") purposeful for tone but borders coherence; no loops, strong propulsion, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms grief trope via leaf blower séance, synthesizing sound/memory/grief into inevitable motes release; bold risk in surreal logic taught early ("wind remembered everything") heightens stakes organically; fresh, non-obvious closure reweights absence.</comment>
