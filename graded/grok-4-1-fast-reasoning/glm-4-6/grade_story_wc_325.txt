<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Claustrophobia paradox embodied concretely in "paradoxically free" amid crushing pressure, driving micro-choice to touch cable; final dissolution earns change via prior irony, though epiphany edges abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of pulses and whispers builds to CR closure in "stabilize in her new state" with conceptual cost of boundary dissolution legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cables as "electric serpents" and thick water constrain path and charge final image of eternal vigil; sensory hierarchy reflects spelunker bias toward confines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to understand facility tightens accumulatively via gold fleck sync and bone-resonating whispers, forcing endurance in dissolution with visible self-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of guardianship in liminality reconfigures premise via final "profound stillness" image, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to "invisible signatures"; rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise in transition beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels but minor paraphrase loops in "crushing pressure/hush" repetitions dull mid-descriptive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quantum ghosts in cables synthesize fresh liminal premise; phase dissolution transforms trope inevitably from spelunker traits.</comment>
