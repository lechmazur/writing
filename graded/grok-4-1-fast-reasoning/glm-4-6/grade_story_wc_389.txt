<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between old order and new movement acts in scene via radio adjustment and descent decision; embodied emotions (forehead to glass, spidery handwriting) reveal hierarchy of values. Final allegiance shift earned by prior micro-choice to alter frequencies with isolation cost. Minor slip: prophetic musings verge on unearned epiphany abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static whispers to coherent prophecy and frequency tweak tightening to CR closure (descent reconfigures divided loyalty). On-page cost legible in "observatory will remain empty" and forgotten name. Orientation anchored early (Elias atop clouds, stormy night); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico recurs tactilely (traced finger, trembles luminous, forehead pressed), constraining observation and charging final earth-vs-clouds image. Stormlit specifics (lightning fractures, vacuum tubes amber) filter via prophetic bias, evolve causally (clears to dawn), mirror turmoil without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (radio dials) guides key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (divided allegiance) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via radio sharpening and subtle alteration narrowing options to self-chosen path. Protagonist agency in frequency redirect forecloses Maren/old paths with felt isolation cost on page. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of balanced light/shadow emerges organically from radio insertion of shadows into "pure light," reweighted in descent image without moralizing. Final reconfiguration answers divided loyalty question resonantly via "gritty whimsy" synthesis. Complexity lingers in Maren's dispersal irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature (prophetic pattern-noticing, static maps). Rhythm modulates intensity (staccato bursts to unfolding dawn); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue; diction biased toward visionary lexicon.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but overwrought figuratives muddle peaks ("unfold like a map drawn in static," "navigate by twilight") with minor mixed vehicles (−0.4). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops, but prophetic phrasing synonym-churns slightly. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophecy and storm allegiance transforms prophet trope via subtle causality (frequency tweak) and gritty descent risk. Non-obvious "variant allegiance to storm" inflects organically; no derivatives, voice coheres as singular vision.</comment>
