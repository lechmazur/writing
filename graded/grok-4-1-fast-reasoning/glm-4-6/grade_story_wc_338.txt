<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Traits like methodically curious drive concrete actions (aligning timestamps, ritual), but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; steady pursuit yields credible endurance without deeper embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from video alignment to ritual distortion; CR closure ("acoustic patterns... formed words") lands on-page with conceptual cost of larger journey, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vault's curve "like a question mark" and dawn through high windows constrain ritual space and charge final perception image; selective sensory details (rust tears, flickering) mirror internal shifts without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen chapel via silence) tightens through video cadence overlap forcing ritual; agency in comparisons narrows options with felt conceptual price in purpose shift, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silences emerges organically via map tears and distortions; final image ("whispered chapel sang... space between moments") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature (silences, tears) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from setup to charged revelation, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image (e.g., "poured... meteorite and holy water"); purposeful "map tears" motif avoids loops, varied rhythm propels to closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map framer's silence-empathy reopening dimensional tear via silent videos transforms tropes; risk in textural ritual pays off in inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
