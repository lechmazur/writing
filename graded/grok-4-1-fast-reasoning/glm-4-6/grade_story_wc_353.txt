<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied empathy ("fingers tracing the surface like a blind reader learning a score") driving micro-choices; symphonically minded trait earns final renunciation of endless revival with felt cost of fleeting song.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; on-page Charged Poise closure ("The last note hung... dissolving into the hush") reconfigures silence with conceptual cost of transience, oriented early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator as micro-setting constrains strumming choice and charges final warm-hand image; grove's "trees themselves leaned in" mirrors internal states tactilely through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively from faint hum to "song grew louder... filling the quiet spaces"; agency in deliberate strumming forecloses endless silence with visible fleeting cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reviving broken voices emerges organically; final "world... not so silent after all—just waiting... to strum the right chord" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with perceptual signature ("ghosted melodies in the sway") modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off at hushed closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("fractures trembled, releasing a low thrum"); minor metaphor density in opening fits voice without muddling climax strumming beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telegraph insulator as song-conduit transforms silence trope; bold lyric risk in "hedgehog’s uncurling dusk" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
