<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in clearing debris and brushing the brick hollow anchors motivation, with micro-choices under post-fire pressure revealing adaptive endurance; minor slip in unearned epiphany phrasing ("truth settling into him not like a weight, but like light") borders therapy-speak without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries (ledger to frost runes to mineshaft revelation) tightening to CR closure in final crucible decision embedding sorrow, with legible conceptual cost reweighting art as testimony; orientation anchored early in workshop/canyon, structure fits two-shard default cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost patterns on greenhouse window and collapsed mineshaft debris constrain choices (guide retracing, reveal crates), charging final image of melting ash; selective sensory hierarchy (smells of ghosts/scorched earth, crystalline air) reflects artist's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding purpose post-trauma signaled early escalates accumulatively via frost-deepening that narrows to mineshaft revelation, forcing renunciation of prior opacity fears with visible cost in embedding soot/sorrow; agency coherent in deliberate retracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of creation against destruction emerges organically from ledger-frost-mineshaft arc to final resonant image of art as "clear and dark testimony"; non-literal reconfiguration avoids moralizing, with earned complexity in syndicate's silencing gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/glass metaphors like "sculptor of light") modulates rhythmically under quiet pressure; purposeful lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged final poise without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost-path led him... to a small, collapsed mineshaft") propels accumulatively; figurative density purposeful in opening ("stars stitching the ink-black sky") without muddle in peak revelation beat, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frost runes decoding ledger transforms artist-trauma trope into testimony-art via mineshaft twist; risk-taking in pattern-taught guidance heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
