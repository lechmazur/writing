<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's face blindness creates ironic internal conflict shown concretely in reconstructing via fragments rather than faces, compelling the methodical sketch as earned endurance. Contradictory impulses (curse and calling) act simultaneously in the ritual, with final folding/ departure foreclosing indifference at felt cost. Strengths dominate; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ribbon discovery to sketch convergence, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in the portrait's resonance—"a story told in charcoal and silence"—with legible cost in "didn’t know if it mattered... but necessary." Orientation anchored early (quarry, Lena's case); single scene fits defaults perfectly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry mist and silt constrain choices (kneeling, flat rock setup) and charge final image ("mist seemed to thin... whisper of acknowledgment"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (charcoal-stained fingers, mist's breath); evolves causally with dusk, mirroring unification without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy via portrait) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through drawing density ("strokes growing bolder"), narrowing to Charged Poise endurance with cost in fog-bitten resolve and world's indifference. Agency in micro-choices (pin ribbon, merge opposites); one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented empathy emerges organically from process, final image ("ribbon... lifeline... veil of forgotten tears") offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence/presence without moralizing. Subtext in ironic blindness; complexity lingers in quiet ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (fragments as "ghost," opposites unified); rhythmic control modulates from hushed to bold strokes under dusk pressure. Prose texture character-specific (methodical precision in syntax); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "strokes growing bolder as the image sharpened"); metaphors consistent/patterned (mist as shroud/breath), no loops or muddle in peak sketch beat. Minor overwriting in openings offset by ear-test rhythm; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's unorthodox portraits transform cold-case trope via specific irony and method; bold lyric accumulation risks poeticism but heightens resonance (+0.3). Inevitable synthesis in quarry unification feels fresh, no derivatives.</comment>
