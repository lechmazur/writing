<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Queen's motivation rooted in dreams compels climb and awakening, with embodied tension in racing heart; seneschal applies relational pressure effectively. Climax realization at "she was not dreaming... but remembering" feels slightly told over fully earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream images accumulate to CR closure ("kingdom... beginning to fracture"); orientation anchors early via castle/mirror/dawn. One tightening at grotto entry narrows to stay/return with felt cost; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's pulsing light and bleeding starlight constrain entry/awakening and charge final image. Sensory details (mist-to-fireflies, ember flare) selective via queen's dream-biased perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream mystery to identity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fireflies/seneschal/grotto to stance crystallization; agency in climb/resolution forecloses kingdom path. Cost legible in thunder-crack fracture image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of celestial home vs. mortal duty emerges organically from bleeding starlight motif shifting rust-to-ruby, reweighting kingdom as fragile. Final smile answers question non-literally with conceptual cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (dream-filtered notices like fireflies-as-stars); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I could not let you face this alone"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting in peak ("starlight... bled into the rock in scarlet streams") mixes metaphors slightly; "fromfitful" typo dulls opening propulsion. No loops, varied rhythm holds momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian trope via bleeding starlight/ember patterns transforming dreams to memory; "lacy menace" smile risks bold tone shift heightening abandonment cost without gimmick.</comment>
