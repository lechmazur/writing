<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Registrar's motivation clear in pulse-quickening observation and step into forecourt, with embodied shift from isolation; figures' tension relaxes earned via doodles but remain archetypal without distinct impulses or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symbol density builds from ambiguous doodles to unbroken circle, yielding Charged Poise closure in tea-sharing with legible cost of risked isolation; orientation anchored early in reception/forecourt, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forecourt's crystal stones constrain registrar's step (shimmering reaction) and charge final hush-as-applause image; selective sensory hum after rain mirrors thawing, POV-filtered via symbols over visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mistrust thaws accumulatively via doodle progression (spiral to circle), registrar's agency in "I see you" tightens pressure; cost felt in shoulders' release and foreclosed aloneness at tea nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of symbolic honesty emerges via doodles/particulars, resonating in final "ambiguously clear" life realization; "Freed by honesty" murmur on-nose, slightly undercutting subtext in pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature on symbols/hush; voice lyrical and modulated, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I see you," "Tea?"); no head-hopping, diction fits quiet world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies but "resonant hush"/"quiet" loops (5+ echoes) create paraphrase churn in closing beats, dulling density; figurative "shoulders knotting like tangled thread" purposeful but risks muddle amid overwrought hush reprises.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh post-verbal world via doodles/symbols transforms silence trope organically; risk in lyric accumulative hush pattern heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
