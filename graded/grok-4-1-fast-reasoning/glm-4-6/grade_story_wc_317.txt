<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between methodical analysis ("jeweler’s loupe, soil sensor") and intuitive acceptance, earning final renunciation with embodied shift from anxiety to quietude. Traits particular to puzzle-master shine in micro-choices like orthogonal attacks. Minor abstractness in "profound quietude" avoids epiphany but borders diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from package reveal to meditative placement, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("anxiety had dissolved... that was more than enough") with legible conceptual cost of accepting limits. Single scene oriented early (workshop by brook). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook's murmur and moonlight constrain meditative choice, mirroring internal hush and charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile seed warmth, auditory brook) filtered through puzzle-master POV. Micro-setting (workbench tools, windowsill) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel seed's puzzle) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (tools fail → intuition) narrowing to renunciation under lens. Agency in sequential approaches forecloses forceful solving with felt emotional cost. One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in final shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of safeguarding mystery emerges organically from failed analysis to acceptance, resonant in final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (seed pulse matching heartbeat) build complexity. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with puzzle-master perceptual signature (noting "micro-etched spiral," "bio-electrical field"). Voice rhythmic and textured, modulating from analytical to hushed. No dialogue or head-hopping; elision of seed nature taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Density high but overwriting drags with stacked metaphors ("mythic weight settled like a shroud," "storm-born silence") in opening, creating minor coherence drag (-0.6). Varied rhythm mostly propels; paraphrase loops minimal ("silence" variants). No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room logic applied to mythic seed transforms trope into intuitive leap. Risk in poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable premise angle on innovation as acceptance.</comment>
