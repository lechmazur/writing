<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation intensely rooted in protecting Althea, with prudently daring trait enabling snow code despite trap recognition; interiority concrete in "phantom of warmth" embodiment. Contradictory impulses subtle (spent daring vs. hoarded courage), but final selfless choice earned via prior causality. Reflection heavy but anchored to pillbox cue, tilting present stance without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pillbox discovery to snow cipher, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Elias walks away whole, cost legible in "sanctuary carved from his own ruin." Orientation anchored early (bluff, mist, spring tilt). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded bluff and snow constrain choices (ephemeral cipher visible from air), charging final image as "mist swallowed his form." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (professional eye for coordinates, snow patterns); evolves causally with wind erasure. Purposeful silver hush integrates action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix Althea's future) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pillbox → coordinates → snow invitation, narrowing to renunciation with on-page cost ("his own ruin"). Internal pressure coherent under lens, agency in cipher forces stance crystallization. No abstract stakes; visceral in trap acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of selfless repair emerges from particulars (ivy/thorns map, snow ghost), reweighting premise in final image of wholeness without moral state. Subtext in silence/implication avoids tidy epiphany; complexity in enduring past failure lingers. Resonant non-literal answer: courage as "final, selfless act of creation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (hushed lyricism: "mist swirled like cold, ectoplasmic water"); syntax/rhythm modulate from hush to deliberate stamping resolve. No head-hopping or leakage; perceptual bias spy-specific (codes, traps). Prose texture character-driven under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "brushed away the snow, his fingers tracing... phantom of warmth"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("silver hush") purposeful/patterned, not muddling peak beats. Zero artifacts touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow cipher transforms spy trope into ephemeral invitation, fresh synthesis of lyric hush with covert action; risk in quiet renunciation heightens stakes. Non-obvious angle on redemption via "codes in accumulated snow" feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold structural poise in accumulative close.</comment>
