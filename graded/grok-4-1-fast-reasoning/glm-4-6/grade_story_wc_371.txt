<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reintroduce beauty is embodied in concrete actions like digging soil and sharing bread, revealing contradictory impulses (sharp observations vs. gentle shawl habit) that intensify under the baker's arrival. Interiority feels particular without stock phrasing, and the final hope emerges from prior micro-choices with visible cost (loaf consumed as bridge). Old man's pressure forces relational shift, but lacks deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (scents, moss) builds to pattern break (rustle/revelation) and Charged Poise closure in final tea-pouring/bird chirp image, reweighting loss with defiant continuity and felt cost (bakery's end sustains via memory). Orientation anchored early (~50 words); one tightening via bread revelation narrows isolation. Single scene coherent, no shards or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (damp earth, yeast warmth, yew rustle) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal fraying (crumbling balustrade) and constraining choices (barren soil for seeds, hedge hides man). Tea house/overgrown courtyard charges final image as foundation for hope. Spatial choreography clear; no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim sacred amid loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via man/bread revelation that forces stance shift (from solitary ritual to shared bridge), with on-page cost (loaf gone, but memory endures). Protagonist agency in offering bread/enduring change; pressure coheres without reversal overload. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-man slightly softens visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of persistence in ordinary emerges organically from seed-planting, bread-sharing, to final wildflower scent/bird chirp reweighting "unraveling world" premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures (man shrugs, vanishes) invites ambiguity on absolution. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing fraying/moss as "ghosts," scents as anchors); diction/rhythm modulates poetically yet controlled. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The world moved on"), advances revelation. No head-hopping; voice distinct between narration and brief speech.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6<comment>High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "fingers brushing against moss... chased through memories"), varied rhythm suits lyric accumulative mode; no major loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("crust a perfect map," "seeds like tiny prayers") clusters pre-climax, slightly blurring peak rustle beat without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-loss guerrilla gardening and baker encounter transforms creeping decay trope into hopeful defiance; bread/seed motifs constrain choices organically. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off without gimmickry; particular details (phantom bakery scent) feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
