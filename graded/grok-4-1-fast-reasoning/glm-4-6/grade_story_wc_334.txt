<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied curiosity merges child and researcher selves at closure ("the chronically curious child she once was merging with the methodical researcher"), earning her commitment with felt cost of alignment; interiority concrete via sensory nostalgia triggers, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as observations densify to revelation; on-page CR closure lands with conceptual cost ("Your protective field weakens with age") reweighting her lifelong draw; orientation anchored early in greenhouse details, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choices (traces glass patterns at water's edge) and charge final image (shipwrecks gleam as sentinels); sensory hierarchy folklorist-specific (light fractures as star charts), vivid and purposeful without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven studying that bubbles water and floods understanding; tightening reweights options under accumulative lens as veil thins, cost legible in her needed role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fraying realities emerges organically from particulars (broken constellations, pulsing mushroom); final image ("new habit... studying... spaces between") offers resonant CR repricing habits/veils without moralizing, recharging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with folklorist perceptual signature (patterns as puzzles, mycological chronophysics); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at revelation, purposeful compression taught early in light refractions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring insight ("The method came to her suddenly"); minor register elevation ("chronophysics") purposeful for voice, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklorist chronophysics, shipwreck refractions as portals transforms fairy ring trope; risk-taking in time-folding CR ("morning and evening can occupy the same moment") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
