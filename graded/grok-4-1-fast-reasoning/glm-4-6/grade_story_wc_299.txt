<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in sound metaphors (e.g., "hum of cheap fluorescent lights," vibrations as "giant, broken drums"); motivation to find purpose intensifies credibly via scrap, earning resolve with cost of unfinished work. Minor label-speak ("confidently uncertain") borders diagnostic but ties to micro-choice of pocketing scrap. Contradictory impulses (facts vs. memory pull) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from inventory numbness to scrap-triggered memories, culminating in CR closure ("real work often began when the cheering stopped") with legible cost (locks door, leaves inventory). Orientation anchored para 1; single scene coherent. Final image reconfigures failure premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (dust/coffee smell, fluorescent hum, dynamite vibrations) reflects Leo's auditory bias and mirrors internal "echo valley longing." Trailer constrains isolation, charges closure as he locks door. Grille cloth as recurring micro-object reweights inventory list.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via scrap discovery/memory, narrowing to renunciation of old self-focus. Agency in pocketing scrap/locking door forecloses completion path with felt cost. One tightening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "after the applause" emerges organically from scrap vs. manuals contrast, reweighting premise in final realization/image without statement. Resonance from particulars (torn cloth, humid club memory) invites ambiguity on failure's meaning. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (sound/texture obsessions like "low, steady hum of an old tube amp"); rhythmic control modulates from numb to resolute. No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge (e.g., Vox amp recognition earned by past).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful sound metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "echo" variants) purposeful for tone, not scaffold. Propulsion clear in closure beat ("placed the scrap... tucked carefully in his pocket").</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: roadie past haunts appraiser present via scrap, transforming "failure" trope into "after" insight. Memorable angle on antiques as "rubble of his own life"; risk in quiet CR pays off without gimmick.</comment>
