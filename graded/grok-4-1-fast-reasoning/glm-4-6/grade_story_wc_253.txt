<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's blank face and dramatic narration embody contradictory impulses, with micro-choices like palming the carving during inspection revealing values under pressure. Moral ambiguity drives compliant performance vs. hidden rebellion, earning the final placement. Minor therapy-speak ("grief disorder") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from whittling ritual to inspector interruption, tightening via risk, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"hummingbird among the dried stems"—with conceptual cost of "dangerously authentic" blooming legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind turbines' "mechanical breath" and "endless rotation" recur to contrast internal defiance, constraining via audible hum during inspection; floorboards hide bouquet, charging final indoor bloom against external hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticity vs. Mandate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via unscheduled knock forcing palm-the-carving trade-off; agency in post-inspection retrieval/arrangement forecloses detection path with felt risk charging final whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of carried grief emerges organically via whittling-to-bird evolution and bouquet preservation, reweighted non-literally in closing image: "something beautifully, dangerously authentic was blooming" answers Mandate's hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in dramatic narration ("The knife slices through the birch"); rhythmic modulation under stress via short, embodied phrases; purposeful narration elision pays off in inspector scene subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., shavings "like snow" advance atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in narration repeats ("Elara narrated/whispered") and occasional elevated diction slightly drag propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional-dystopia tropes via whittling memorials and narrated defiance transforms Mandate premise; final bird-in-bouquet reconfiguration feels inevitable from established rituals, risking bold quiet rebellion.</comment>
