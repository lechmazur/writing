<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover ceiling secrets roots all actions consistently, with embodied familiarity in the hand-hover beat; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the vision or climb for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust patterns build to vision, discovery, and room reconfiguration; closure lands as Charged Poise in the eruption and dissipated sorrow with felt scar-like cost in final pocket image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ceiling cracks and dust constrain choices (spotting swirl, climbing lath) and charge final image as "solved riddle"; sensory hierarchy (grime calligraphy, temperature drop) filters through POV expertise vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ceiling secrets tightens texturally via dust swirl to object eruption narrowing to bittersweet release; agency in observation/climb drives escalation, cost legible in stumble and foreclosed ghost persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of past imprints reweights via mainspring release without moralizing; final "cracks... solved riddle" offers resonant non-literal answer to hidden histories, emerging organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ghost-as-imprint diction and selective noticing (dust trails over drafts); stable third-person limited POV with rhythmic modulation peaks cleanly in vision without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density (shroud, calligraphy, specters) overwrites vision beat slightly, risking coherence without payoff; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "cracks in the façade" dull propulsion mid-story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-hunter technician reading dust/ceilings in circus relic transforms trope organically; risk-taking in textural ghost mechanics heightens closure ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
