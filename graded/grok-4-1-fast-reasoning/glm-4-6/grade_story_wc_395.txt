<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with gaps drives concrete micro-choices like fabricating the audit, culminating in earned shift to avenger; interiority embodied in "gnawed at him more than any angry executive." Minor flaw: reflective summary slightly abstracts peak realization without full contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with clue density tightening to pocket dimension discovery; CR closure lands on-page in "He began uploading the file" with conceptual cost of unleashing revolution against empire. Orientation anchored early in Archive; one meaningful deepening via song revelation reconfigures knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's "low thrum of forgotten songs" and pocket dimension constrain digital excavation, charging final image; sensory details like "ghostly echo" filter through Elias's perceptual bias. Micro-setting of patch and numbers recurs to shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering deletions escalates via accumulative clue density (2319 to song), narrowing options to broadcast; agency in upload forecloses keeper role with felt cost in "avenger" reconfiguration. One decisive deepening at song playback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of curated absence vs. buried revolution emerges organically from song-as-key particulars; final broadcast reweights scarcity premise without moralizing. Resonance in recurring numbers shifting from ghost to public key.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of digital ghosts ("felt absence that gnawed"); rhythmic prose modulates obsession's intensity. No dialogue; voice distinct in textured metaphors like "jagged scar in the network’s official timeline."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; minor overwriting in opening metaphors slightly slows but supports texture. No loops; propulsion clear in clue beats, closure image sharp: "broadcasting Eva’s song on every public channel."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital forensics and harmonic sabotage transforms conspiracy trope; song as destabilizing key feels inevitable from 2319 pattern. Risk in poetic compression heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
