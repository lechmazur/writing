<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in silent visions intensifies compellingly to surrender; embodied sensations like "ice and fire" reveal character under pressure. Minor diagnostic epiphany in "pilgrimage wasn't about arriving" edges toward unearned insight despite causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern build from hums/shadows to resolution; CR closure via expanded consciousness reconfigures perception with surrender cost legible in "bright darkness overwhelmed her senses." Orientation anchored early; one tightening at pearl touch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystalline formations and shadows as doorways constrain choices and charge pearl image. Sensory hierarchy (hums, luminescence) reflects clairvoyant bias, integrated into action; recurring shadows evolve causally to convergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore visions/magnify magic) signaled early, deepens via pearl touch narrowing to transformation under Accumulative lens. Agency in reach forecloses foresight path with invitation cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of experience over foresight emerges organically from particulars like shadow grammar; final image of branching futures offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in pilgrim dialogue reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via synesthetic cave notices (sound/light merge) biases vividly; dialogue sparse but subtextual, distinct voices in final exchange. Stable third-person limited, rhythmic modulation under transformation stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but dense metaphors like "cosmic grammar of cause and effect" border overwriting in peak transformation beat, slightly dulling propulsion. No major loops; varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophecy inversion via cave physics transforms tropes organically. Shadow doorways and pearl anchor bold premise without retreat; risk in abstract tone pays off at closure image.</comment>
