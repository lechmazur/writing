<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia creates credible internal conflict shown in "fought her instinct to flee these confines" during climax, with contradictory determination compelling the transfixing action; motivation rooted in restoring balance intensifies prudently. Interiority concrete via embodied heart hammering and trembling hand, but leans toward summary in epiphanic close ("transcended the limitations of her own nature"). Earned change forecloses fear path with felt psychological cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Oriented early in first paragraph (explorer, nexus, fallow period); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as organ frequencies and spatial distortions build density to Charged Poise closure when "nexus settled into cohesive geometry." One tightening via surging mutiny during compass press narrows options; cost legible in her "breathless with possibilities" after fighting confinement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus vividly sensory (starlight fracturing, walls breathing/shimmering) filters through claustrophobic bias, constraining climax choice as spaces "constricting and expanding." Organ echoes and star-etched floor evolve causally, charging final etched compass image; micro-setting (compass, floor) indispensable to transfix.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quell spatial mutiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via "shadows elongating into impossible angularities" during organ crescendo, forcing endurance agency in pressing compass. Tightening forecloses flight option with embodied cost ("resonating with each sustained chord"); world-scale felt viscerally in nexus response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony over force emerges organically from organ-calibrated restoration contrasting mutinous chaos, with final church-draw image offering resonant non-literal answer to constraint-rebellion question. Subtext in wistful transcendence avoids moralizing; recurring organ motif reweights particulars without token symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (claustrophobic geometry focus); rhythmic poetic diction modulates intensity, compressing at peak ("music swelled... connect with something ancient"). No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture particular via angularity/starlight idiom.</comment>
<question>7</grade>5.8<comment>Exact phrase loops ("reverberation of a lonely church organ" x3, "spatial mutiny" x4) create template cadence dulling climax propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors ("hungry maws," "gossamer," "prismatic shards") in high-pressure beat reduces density (-1.2 total). Paraphrase redundancy in reflective close ("wistful rebellion" echoes); rhythm varies but artifacts obscure cause/effect at transfix.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny quelled via organ-compass harmony synthesizes fresh physics-defying premise organically; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Climax turn from chaos to etched blueprint feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
