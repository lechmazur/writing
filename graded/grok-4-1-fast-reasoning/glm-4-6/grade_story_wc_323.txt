<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's curiosity and navigation expertise drive consistent choices, embodied in the anchor link's handling; internal shift to "somber marvel" feels earned via lesson's impact on students, though milder contradictory impulses limit higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final image of anchor as "bridge between worlds" and corals-as-stars, reweighting isolation with conceptual cost; orientation anchored immediately in Thalassia prep.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Benthic city and bioluminescent corals constrain visibility stakes and charge final image as star proxy; anchor link as micro-setting recurs tactilely, filtering through Elias's ancestral POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of star-navigation teaching tightens texturally via students' widened eyes and posture shift, narrowing to isolation cost; agency in lesson delivery forecloses depth-bound limits with felt future delay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of depth-to-stars connection emerges via anchor's evolution and final coral image repricing humanity's potential; resonant without moralizing, though "truly human again" edges overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (celestial patterns through submariner lens); sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven, modulating rhythm under reflective poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via integrated stellar projections; minor "balancedly curious" repetition jars slightly but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abyss-hiding humans learning star nav via alien gifts, transformed by anchor's chain motif linking ocean to cosmos; risks quiet CR payoff effectively.</comment>
