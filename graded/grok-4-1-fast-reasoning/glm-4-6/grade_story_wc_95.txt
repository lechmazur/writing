<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's mechanical arm integrates into actions and tension effectively, revealing traits under pressure; Lyra applies immediate opposition in dialogue. Final relaxation of the arm marks earned change with relational cost. Interiority leans descriptive over contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: descriptive buildup to Lyra's arrival and dialogue density culminates in RR closure ("the duel ceased... understanding") with foreclosed opposition legible in final image. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt. One tightening via sun-shifted angles suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial and needle card constrain duel choices and charge final alignment; atrium glass refracts tension, brook evolves with brook's rhythm quickening to murmur agreement. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mech eye scans markings). Micro-setting (mech arm, tin card) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intellectual power shift via duel) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through parry-riposte dialogue to mutual reconfiguration; sun trajectory tightens options. Agency in positioning/arguments forecloses discord with felt harmony cost in final brush. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (queries as pathways, overture to understanding) emerges from particulars like windmill/needle shifts; final image ("overture wasn’t hidden") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of transformed opposition. No moralizing; ambiguity in chaos-to-symphony lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close Elias POV with perceptual bias (mech arm/eye); distinct dialogue idioms (Elias velvet blade, Lyra shattering laugh). Rhythmic modulation peaks in duel exchanges; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but overwrought figuratives in peak duel ("whirring like a philosophical argument," "velvet-covered blade") muddle slightly without payoff. Minor paraphrase loops in atrium descriptions ("echoing like a challenge, each breath a tentative answer"). Propulsion strong overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh steampunk-philosophic duel via coded sundial/needle transforms trope organically; risk in geometric dialect heightens stakes. Final fingers-brush reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
