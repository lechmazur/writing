<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands and sweat when approaching the death mirror, reveal contradictory impulses toward life and acceptance. Interiority concrete via clasp's pulse and mirror distortions. Final embrace earns change through prior fear buildup, with felt cost of merging death/life halves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrors shift and paths form via clasp glow, density increases to CR closure where acceptance reconfigures curse as art, cost legible in clasp's fade and advisor's transformation. Orientation anchored early (funhouse entry, post-death). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain path choice and charge final gallery image, with tactile glow/pulse of clasp as micro-setting. Sensory selectivity (chill, wavering reflections) filters through cursed POV urgency. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal merger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear/curse) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via clasp urging and path choice narrowing to terrifying death mirror. Agency in paradoxical embrace forecloses denial with on-page tremble/scream cost, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fear-to-art transformation emerges organically via mirrors/clasp, resonant CR in "transform fear itself into art" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in advisor's riddles and death embrace invites ambiguity on liminal witness role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with surreal perceptual signature (warped mirrors as curse). Whisper dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via urges ("unbosom yourself"). Rhythm modulates tension, diction biased to dreamlike distortions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to clasp's "white-hot" burn. Minor paraphrase loops ("whispering advisor," "lingering luminance") in mid-section slightly dull momentum but don't touch closure. No heavy artifacts, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-death curse, funhouse mirrors, and clasp as art-key transforms tropes via photographic distortions and paradoxical embrace. Risky surreal closure ("fear itself into art") inevitable from prior riddle buildup.</comment>
