<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's contradictory caution and abandon drive micro-choices like the skylight entry and piece swaps, earning his final renunciation of apprenticeship with felt relational cost. Architect applies immediate pressure via the game ritual, revealing mutual trust. Minor telling in "his honor demanded a heist" doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: climb enables entry, which triggers Architect confrontation, leading to swaps that cause spire shudder and sky reset (DC/RR closure). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (spire, apprentice). Pocket sundial lid constraint shapes final exchange with conceptual cost of unmeasured time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "air thin enough to taste like broken glass" and "scent of ozone" constrain climb and reveal Architect; wrong sky gravity pressures tactics. Final sky reset to "blues and golds" charges closure image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend plans to save wildness) signaled early, tightens via swaps under causal lens, narrowing to Kaelen's win with agency in queen counter. Cost legible in foreclosed apprenticeship: "letting go of the man who had taught him to wonder."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of wild abandon vs. joyless perfection emerges via chess ritual and sky reconfiguration; final image of Kaelen "painting his first stroke" on sky offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lyrical notices like "sky below him swirling in colors it shouldn’t have." Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’ve come to trade"), advances plot; rhythm modulates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors taught early (e.g., sky wrongness); varied rhythm propels. Paraphrase loops in final descent ("Kaelen smiled... stepped forward... walked on") dull closure image slightly (−0.5), but no filter stacks or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief-heist into trust ritual via chess swaps in fantastical spire; transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
