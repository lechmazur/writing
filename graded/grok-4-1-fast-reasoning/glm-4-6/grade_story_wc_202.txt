<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through tactile responses like "fingers trembling as the aligning marks glowed," rooting motivation in personal history; earned change in self-recognition via merchant interaction, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal viewing moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via fragment discoveries and holds to CR closure ("the story was never just about her"; fragment fades to "ordinary glass" as conceptual cost of ongoing work); orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with taught fade to study, no shards violation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (warms, shifts painting view) and charges final image (pulses then fades); sensory details selective via POV urgency ("voices fading into a distant hum"); market evolves causally from vibrant to dissolving mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover lineage) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through painting views narrowing to self-portrait; agency in "look closer" and taking canvases forces trade-off (time bends, market dissolves); cost legible in "work just beginning" charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked translator lineage emerges organically from particulars like room of women with fragments; resonant CR in chorus vision reweights premise without moralizing; final pen-lift offers non-literal answer to isolation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in detail-noticing ("stitched with hidden details"); voice lyrical and consistent, modulating to charged poise at "eternal instant stretched"; merchant dialogue sparse but subtextual and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("the fragment" reprise x8, "between childhood and now" x3) dull some propulsion; rhythm varies purposefully in market hum to study quiet; no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist market and time-lens fragments transforms trope of hidden lineage into inevitable CR; self-portrait turn grows from established pattern, risk-taking in nonlinear time-bend heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
