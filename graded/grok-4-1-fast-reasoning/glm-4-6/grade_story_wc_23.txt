<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in censer warming in palm and throat tightening at final line; contradictory impulses in knowing method "absurd" yet proceeding. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "grief had its own logic" and "geography of loss" feel unearned mid-process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via map-sketching beats to Charged Poise closure ("he could walk on his own"); cost legible in map fading but etched internally. Orientation anchored early; phone ring micro-turn tightens without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains choices (guides hand, placed center) and charges final image (taken in hand as he walks). Sensory selection purposeful (stars indifferent, dusty glass) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate loss via map) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with phone ignore foreclosing crutch; agency in drawing final jagged line and walking shows endurance with cost (joints aching, endless journey).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss as navigable geography emerges organically via patches/map/censer; final image ("walk...through it") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor drift to explicit "navigation was the solace" slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (patches bristling, stars whispering); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture apt for lens. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled despite poetic bent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density but overwriting with figurative stacks ("stars...unanswered prayers," "moon like a silver coin") in most sentences dulls key map-building beat; minor paraphrase loops on "silence" (broken, returns deeper). Propulsion strong otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of patchwork coat/memories and censer as grief-compass transforms reverse migration trope; risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via pattern-taught motifs without gimmickry.</comment>
