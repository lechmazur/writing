<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in contradiction (drought profiteer preserves what he destroyed) drives micro-choices like whispering to egg and activating device, with embodied emotion in "heart breaking" and blood-rush silence. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene via sentiment amid amoral acts. Final endurance earned by prior causality, but occasional label-speak ("secretly sentimental") slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival/map-tracing to release, culminating in on-page CR ("egg gone... echo preserved") with conceptual cost of ironic preservation legible in final rain-erased footprints. Orientation anchored early (salt flat, egg, drought backstory). One tightening via precise spot arrival suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains choice (precise pan for resonance) and charges final image (rain striking crystals as "arrhythmic applause," mirroring flight paths). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fractures as map, vibrating echo). Details evolve causally (micro-fractures, precipitation); thunder tightens atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve extinct echo despite self-caused extinction) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening sentiment/density to release with felt conceptual cost (ironic echo in destroyed land). Agency in device activation forecloses failure path; one tightening at spot-kneel suffices. Moral calculus sharpens peak (competing destruction/preservation).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fractured grace emerges organically from particulars (cracks/map, egg-to-echo, drought echo); final image offers resonant CR repricing destroyer-as-preserver without moralizing. Subtext in ironic preservation invites ambiguity; no tidy resolution, counter-readings plausible via his "amoral" facade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractured patterns, resonant ghosts); voice texture lyrical yet biased toward sentiment (e.g., "ghost image shimmering"). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at release; purposeful compression legible under textural lens. Elevated diction consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in peak beats ("pearl... forgotten sunlight," "bruised sky," repeated "fractured") risks muddle without full pattern payoff, docking from 9-band. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies, syntax purposeful. Clarity holds at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-villain's ironic redemption via bio-resonance on self-made salt flat feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual egg-release heightens stakes. Motifs like cracks transform trope of extinction guilt into charged map/method. No derivative echoes, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
