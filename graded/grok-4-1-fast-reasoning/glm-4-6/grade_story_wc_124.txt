<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in specific sensory triggers; final tears shift from uncontrolled to clarified grief, earning closure change, but minor diagnostic phrasing like "dissect the chemistry of sorrow" borders on abstracted self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to UV reveal as CR closure; cost legible in "grieving, yes, but with clarity" reweighting sorrow's architecture; single scene anchors orientation early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse and tools (vial, lantern) constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details (ozone-honey, violet-gold wisps) filtered through POV bias, evolve with events without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture memory trigger) signaled early, tightens via UV deepening that changes knowledge; agency in experiment and sealing vial forecloses uncontrolled grief with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of scent-memory's layered loss emerges organically from particulars like father's coat intertwined with flower; final swirling vial offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with scent-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from wistful to anticipatory focus; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but occasional figurative density (e.g., "fractured monument to a flower") in setup risks minor overload without mid-beat payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lantern broker hunting UV scent-shadows in extinct greenhouse transforms memory trope; risk-taking in synesthetic premise heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
