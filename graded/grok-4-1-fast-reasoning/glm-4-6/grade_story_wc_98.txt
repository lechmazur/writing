<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's luminous doubt creates embodied contradiction, driving micro-choices like interpreting clumsiness in the dream-woman scene; final activation earns change with felt warmth/cost. Minor abstract therapy-speak in "profound, almost desperate, need" slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ridge hum to dream cacophony/void, tightening to "Unfinished" whisper; Charged Poise closure pulses seed with monsoon wind cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blossoms/stone constrain ritual (only anchor site), scents pull into dreams, hum vibrates bones; final bow brighter charges image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sweet decay mirrors doubt).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (waken seed pre-monsoon) signaled early, deepens via dream reversals narrowing to void; agency in intent/whisper forecloses doubt with warmth/time cost felt as wind rises. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truths in absences/doubt's value) emerges via particulars like starlight-net flaw to void; final "spaces between things" reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with whimsical perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical blend"); diction/rhythm modulate from reverent to intense dream currents, charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; figurative language ("blossoms unfurling like apologetic palms") pattern-taught without muddle in peak void beat. Minor paraphrase in doubt repetitions purposeful, not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Empirically whimsical fantasy transforms memory trope via dream-void logic; risk-taking in textured lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at seed-pulse/seed-pouch close.</comment>
