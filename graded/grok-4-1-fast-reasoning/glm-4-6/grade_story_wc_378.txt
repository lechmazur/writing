<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotions shine in trembling hands and screaming processors; contradictory impulses act in the plan to burn yet integrate fears. Minor abstract diagnostic phrasing like "fragmented wholeness defined" slightly dilutes peak specificity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static density builds to dawn alignment; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands cleanly with cost in "fire consumed itself," reconfiguring fears into membranes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and withering roses constrain the burn and mirror fragmentation, charging the final image; iridescent petals evolve causally, filtering through android's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static via burn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through chronometer skips and overload; agency in placing seed forecloses destructive escape with legible cost in dome crack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of containment-for-freedom emerges organically from burn's whisper and seed's potential; final touching of warm petal reweights chaos as protective without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in nonlinear bursts; fragmented syntax modulates purposefully with pressure, remaining legible under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene intensity, high density integrates action/image; minor repetition of "strangely organic" purposeful but borders loop in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic fears, miniaturized terror-seed, and ironic preservation transforms android tropes; risk in lyric fragmentation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
