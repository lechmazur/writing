<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to conduct unheard symphonies rooted in chronological homesickness drives all micro-choices like mapping memories to spire flaws; embodied emotions (eyes sting, feet vibrate) particularize longing, with earned stasis in weary descent paying visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via memory mappings to resonant reconfiguration at dawn chord shattering hush; closure costs legible in "slid to the floor, the effort having cost him everything"; single continuous scene with taught ascent anchors orientation early, holding lens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass spire constrains ascent choices (cold seeping slippers, alcoves for shell) and charges final dawn image over frozen lake; mirrored horizon evolves from infinite uncertainty to post-symphony ordinary, mirroring internal shift through selective sensory filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) signaled early and tightens accumulatively through mappings narrowing to apex; agency in humming notes forecloses paths with felt cost in weariness, though opposition mostly internal limits visceral scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fleeting memory recapture emerges organically from mappings to dawn reweighting homesickness as "current pulling his baton"; final descent image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though some pseudo-profundity in "touched a place beyond time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (noticing cracks as smiles, flaws as kites) biased by musical longing; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to crescendo without slippage, voice distinct and lyric-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering (nautilus glow, aurora pulse) risks overwriting in ascent beats but serves accumulative texture; minor synonym churn ("mirrored horizon" thrice) and elevated diction ("upturned hush") drag propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer as memory-conductor in humming spire transforms tropes of nostalgia into tactile symphony; risk-taking in lyric ascent heightens stakes, with closure's dull shell inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
