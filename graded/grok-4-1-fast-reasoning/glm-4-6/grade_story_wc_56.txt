<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—chasing legend while dismantling it—and final renunciation of life's work is earned via honed instincts guiding the haul, with visible cost in "a kind of death" felt before the chest opens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of instinctual cues builds to CR closure in realization ("wrong ending to the correct story"), with cost legible in final sundial image reweighting premise; orientation anchored by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial and canal current constrain choices (decoding shadow, feeling tremor/hollow), charging final image where brass gleams against plates; sensory hierarchy (water lapping, silt grip) reflects Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand lies) deepens via instinctual tightening—tremor to hook bite to haul—forcing trade-off of life's purpose; cost unmistakable in "serene upheaval" dismantling prior belief, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final sundial-plates image offers resonant answer to legend's truth, reweighting "architecture of lies" as dream blueprint without moralizing; emerges from particulars like rotting wood vs. schematics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water-trailing hand and current-feel biases; rhythmic control modulates from serene flow to sharp realization, with stable close third-person distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in lines like "hook bite into something soft: rotting wood"; minor figurative density ("bruised purple," "fossil blueprint") coherent but borders overwrite in reflective beats, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of treasure myth as hoax blueprint, transformed via sundial truth-tool; risk in instinct-led salvage over tech heightens internal stakes organically.</comment>
