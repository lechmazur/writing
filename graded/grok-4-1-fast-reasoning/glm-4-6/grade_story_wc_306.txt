<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's "cloak of doubt" as perpetual state roots his motivation and micro-choices like chime selection, earning Lyra's change; contradictory impulses in his doubt-as-tool dynamic act in scene. Lyra's "sincerely insincere" trait constrains her initial posture but yields embodied tears and grace post-chimes, revealing values hierarchy. Minor label-speak ("sincerely insincere") slightly abstracts without cost embodiment, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via atmospheric buildup to chimes; one tightening (question → sequence → melody) deepens density toward Conceptual Repricing closure. Shard left behind as "lightness a stark reminder of the weight of conviction" lands on-page cost legibly in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (lighthouse, dawn, client); lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse constrains via chimes/rafters/levers, charging chime beat and final shard-hanging image. Sensory hierarchy (misting breath, surf, tones) reflects Elian's priorities, evolving with dawn/ocean glint to mirror internal shift. Micro-setting (shard, chimes) as tools shape choices without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unhook certainty via chimes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through query → selection → melody, narrowing to Lyra's tears/renunciation of shard. Agency in Elian's precise chime choice and her slumped question drives pressure; cost felt in posture change and void relinquished. No reversal overload; single deepening coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nuance infiltrating certainty emerges via shard-void → chimes-harmony → "key through the mail slot," reweighting conviction's "weight" in final ocean/sun image without moralizing. Subtext in "protected vulnerability" charges Lyra's arc organically. Resonant non-literal answer: doubt as "mantle, essential and true."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elian with clean perceptual bias (doubt-tinted observations); voice texture in syntax/rhythm modulates from anticipatory to resonant. Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("unhook the past"); chimes as indirect action advances naturally. Minor elevated diction fits literary tone without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "soft but sharp like breaking glass" advances voice/atmosphere); rhythm varies for buildup to chime melody. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("apology as threat," "breaking glass") during entry slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind-chime conscience, hollow shard, doubt-cloak transforms introspection trope into tactile method. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via chime precision without gimmickry; premise implications (nuance via sound/void) commit fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
