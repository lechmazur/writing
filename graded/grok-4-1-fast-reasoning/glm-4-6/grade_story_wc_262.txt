<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clearly rooted in desperation over unexpressed affections, intensifying to psychometry act; spatially imaginative trait enables visions without stock epiphanies. Interiority embodied via temporal seepage into skin, but limited contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure cap score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from film touch to spiraling visions and CR closure: unused love stored in "when" pockets, reweighting quest with bittersweet cost in final peace image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth anchors vividly with ozone, aged film scent, hushed thunder vibrating walls, constraining solitary communion; film strip as micro-setting charges final image as "map, a key to the vast library."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening visions ("hand reaching... smile directed at empty space") forcing realization; cost felt in soul-settling peace as heavy resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unused love archived in liminal non-existence emerges from concrete visions without statement; final CR ("not a burden... contribution to that great, silent archive") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with distinct perceptual signature (infinite folded spaces, temporal residue); rhythmic control modulates from hushed setup to spiraling crescendo in mind’s ear, supporting pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors ("silver serpent," "pockets folded into time"); minor figurative density in visions ("hushed thunder" motif purposeful) prevents perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms psychometry via film outtakes into temporal archive of love; conceptual risk in "when" revelation feels inevitable from spatial imagination, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
