<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via phantom pains and miscalculation as beacon; final reconnection earned by prior scar-linking causality with felt risk of consumption. Minor diagnostic self-awareness ("learned that intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption") edges from higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to thinning threshold, landing Charged Poise/CR closure in final knock with undeniable risk cost ("risk being unable to breathe yourself"). Orientation anchored early in chapel sanctuary; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skeletal framework and ash-thickened stone constrain movement and charge final archway moment; starlight dims to mirror encroaching pressure. Recurrent sanctuary as micro-setting forces reconnection choice, hitting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sanctuary vs. encroaching despair) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ring vibration narrowing to renunciation of isolation; cost legible in final realization/risk. Single deepening sufficient, but abstract "suffocation of spirit" slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared suffering as double-edged (healing vs. beacon) emerges organically via scar method and final bridge; resonant CR reweights isolation without moralizing ("sometimes to teach something how to breathe, you must first risk being unable to breathe yourself").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (metal as flesh, scars as links); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet precision to urgent vibration without head-hopping or elision debt. Voice particular to Elara's intimate emptiness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (surgeon, orchid) woven into action; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies to propel to closure. Minor overwriting in reflective blocks ("burned bridges carefully, not with fire and fury") dings propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-linking ability drawing its own predators transforms isolation trope; final ring-knock turn inevitable from established beacon logic, with bold risk in communion over stasis.</comment>
