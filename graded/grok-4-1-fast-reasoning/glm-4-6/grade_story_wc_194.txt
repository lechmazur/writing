<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth rooted in bloodline burns consistently and compels crank turns under rising waves; interiority embodied in tactile grip and closing eyes. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal crank moments, leaning toward unearned epiphany feel at revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of waves/shadows builds to CR closure where final crank turn reveals prison truth with conceptual cost of purpose settling in chest. Single scene coherent; orientation anchored early in room/evening. No causality breaks; ghost presence motivates without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone vividly selective via Elias's tactile perception; shadows recur to mirror internal shift, constraining final image as he steps out. Sensory hierarchy fits urgency—vibrations thicken air purposefully. Recurrent shadows charge closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crank slips/presence/wave intensification narrowing to revelation trade-off. Agency in purposeful cranking forecloses erasure path; cost legible in lifted lineage weight. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs truth emerges organically from wave fragments and prison realization; final image of stepping out reweights dynasty premise without moralizing. Subtext in silent figure's nod implies escape cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vibration/shadow noticing; voice rhythmic and biased toward ancestral whispers. Compression purposeful in wave buildup; no head-hopping or withholding. Diction modulates with intensity, fitting lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates image/action; purposeful repetition of crank/shadows propels without loops. Minor figurative density in "shadows danced like old memories" but coherent, no muddle in closure beat. Clean propulsion to final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gramophone waves as intuition bridge transforms ancestral trope into fresh CR; synthesis of vibrations/erasure feels inevitable from particulars. Risk in nonlinear fragments pays off at charged poise of escape. No template echoes; bold voice anchors vision.</comment>
