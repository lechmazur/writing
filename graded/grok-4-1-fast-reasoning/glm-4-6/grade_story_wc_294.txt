<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jasper's polished calm endures via consistent micro-choices like investing despite cycles and silent boardroom exit, revealing contradictory impulses toward legacy vs. wisdom. Interiority concrete in train sanctuary reflections but summarizes startup emotional arc. Final renunciation of Elena's vision earned by inherited patterns, with visible cost in her diminished arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: shards build money/path patterns to Conceptual Repricing closure in Jasper's reply to Elena ("habits we haven't noticed"), reweighting cycles with conceptual cost of failed empires. Mosaic Track B met: pattern taught by inheritance/train (~20%), legible time transitions, coherent drive to ending image. Orientation anchored early (trunk/train by para 2); no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train as micro-setting constrains sanctuary choices and charges final image ("patterns came to die and be reborn"), with tactile rust/angles mirroring internal cycles. Startup office contrasts effectively through "glass-and-steel" reflection. Sensory selection POV-biased toward territorial markers; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding circular paths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via startup manipulation tightening to boardroom renunciation, narrowing options under lens. Agency in investments/return forecloses venture path with felt cost (company fall, Elena's diminishment). One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cycles as habits emerges organically from money patterns and path images, resonant in final juxtaposition of Zimbabwean/Weimar notes reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Elena's pitch ("circle back") shifts via Jasper's wisdom, inviting ambiguity on destiny. Protagonist arc inextricable; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Jasper POV with perceptual signature in cycle-noticing (e.g., "human heart beats in cycles"); rhythmic modulation builds to dusky harmony. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: Elena's "What did you learn?" pursues goal, Jasper's reply crystallizes stance. No head-hopping; voice distinct from Elena's pitch idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm (varying sentences, no loops); metaphors integrated (e.g., "paper tapestry") without muddle in peak return scene. Propulsion via image-action weave; minor scaffold in startup summary (−0.3). Clean mechanics; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: robber's money as territorial wisdom transforms inheritance trope, with startup as cycle test yielding non-obvious "habits" repricing. Risk in mosaic shards heightens pattern stakes (+0.3); no derivative echoes. Bold train sanctuary commits to premise fully.</comment>
