<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in crafting "safe zones for inquiry," shown through micro-choices like abandoning the vase; interiority concrete and embodied in brow furrowing and fingertip tracing. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("attribute of being thoughtfully spirited") slightly undercuts particularity, but final renunciation feels earned with visible cost in shifted purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vase to teardrop via motivated shift inspired by window view. On-page CR closure in "tiny, glowing testament to the concept of the thawing heart," with legible cost of abandoning original project and embedding bookmark as "scar." Orientation anchored early in control room entry; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned control room vividly specific, with rust, dust, and grimy window constraining choices—view of melting icicles triggers abandonment pivot. Recurring bookmark and cobalt glass charge final image; sensory hierarchy (torch hiss, steam plume) reflects glassblower's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpting thawing heart) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven abandonment narrowing options under accumulative lens. Visible cost in forgoing vase and "trapped" story embeds in final teardrop; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thawing heart emerges organically from glass-shaping particulars, reweighted in final embedded teardrop as "freezing and the thaw, the pain and the release." Resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing; ambiguity in "weighty lightness" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in dramatic narration ("Behold, the sacred glass rod"); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. No head-hopping; prose texture (swirling molten glass) biased to contemplative craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density high ("icicles wept," "frantic spirit") borders overwriting in process beats, slightly dulling propulsion without full pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops (narrating moves repeatedly) and template cadence in descriptions ("he narrated/swirled/declared"); rhythm varies but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing philosophy in abandoned floodgate room transforms trope of artist-in-solitude; bookmark embedding as "scar" offers non-obvious thaw inflection. Risky weighty tone heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
