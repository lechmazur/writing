<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maria's contradictory impulses—self-respect demanding truth vs compassion for deceived—embody in hawk metaphor and journal tracing, earning sanctuary decision. Eleanor applies relational pressure softening brusqueness. Minor diagnostic articulation in "balance self-respect with compassion" avoids peak deduction as embodied shortly after.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via object-handling and dialogue to Charged Poise closure in sanctuary naming, reweighting convictions with trust-rebuild cost felt in tail-tip image. Single scene anchored early (workshop, betrayal context by para 2). One tightening via Eleanor's entry forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars and workbench objects (perches, journals, tail tip) constrain reflection, charge final image as tail catches starlight revealing "truest color." Sensory hierarchy (visual hues, mist) reflects Maria's priorities; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct convictions post-betrayal) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Eleanor's push to "move on," forcing trade-off in dialogue. Agency in renunciation of blind trust forecloses ignoring option with emotional cost legible before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth via shedding layers emerges organically from journal/object actions, not statement; final tail-tip reprise offers non-literal answer reweighting fragility to hope-blend without moralizing. Complexity in compassion-for-deceived lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in wildlife-noticing (tail hues mirroring convictions); voice lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in reflection vs dialogue. Distinct idioms: Maria's quiet precision vs Eleanor's brusque concern advance subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("reconstructing" x3, "shedding layers" x3) and dense metaphors in opening (e.g., "quiet vividness... shifting landscape") slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure. Varied syntax, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms betrayal trope via chameleon colors and layer-shedding as wildlife rehab parallel, risking lyric accumulation that heightens stakes organically. Tail-tip reprise inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
