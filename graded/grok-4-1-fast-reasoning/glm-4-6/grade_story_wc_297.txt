<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Root-bound visionary's contradictory impulses (anxious elation urging forward despite dread) act in scene via scar-alignment micro-choice, earning the final purpose shift with embodied cost in tingling hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to nexus pattern-break, CR closure via silver light piercing eclipse reweights covenant premise with conceptual cost of partial mend legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade/oak constrains pivotal choice (clipping groove, scar fissure), charging nexus transition; sensory hierarchy (ozone hum, jagged bark) mirrors internal awe without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend eclipsed covenant) signaled early, deepens via nexus realization forcing recognition; agency in scar-linking forecloses total break with felt pain/cost charging final pierce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of lonely futures/dreams emerges organically from fractured figures' recognition; final silver point offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting arrival's scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (visions as maps, whorls matching fissures); rhythmic prose modulates from buoyant dread to profound poise, eliding portal travel purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short hum gasps amid long sensory weaves); minor figurative density in nexus ("river of memory backward and forward") purposeful but borders coherence in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars as covenant bridge transforms portal trope; nexus halves' mutual loneliness risks bold conceptual turn, inevitable from clipping/oak setup.</comment>
