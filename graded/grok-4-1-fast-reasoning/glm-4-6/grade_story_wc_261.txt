<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—erasing scars for closure vs. preserving stories—act simultaneously in her plant dialogues and apology to Samuel, earning the final renunciation with felt cost in her burning scars. Interiority is concrete via embodied coffee rings and whispering leaves. Minor therapy-speak in realizations slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of plant whispers, coffee-ring patterns, and Samuel visit reweights erasure practice toward preservation, landing CR closure in final hourglass image with conceptual cost of abandoning miracles. One tightening via telepathy revelation narrows options. Orientation anchored early in tower at dawn; two-shard drive fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass and coffee rings recur to constrain realizations and charge closure image as shimmering scars. Sensory details like dawn light through glass and rustling plants mirror internal shift purposefully. Micro-setting of desk/plants guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase vs. read scars) signaled early, deepens texturally via telepathy to force agency in apology, foreclosing erasure path with on-page cost of visible scars persisting. Protagonist alteration crystallizes stance. No reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of scars as stories emerges organically from plant wisdom and coffee rings, reweighted non-literally in hourglass finale without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical texture in syntax/rhythm matching reflective intensity; perceptual bias toward scars/plants selective. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; distance modulates purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in image-heavy lines like "coffee rings... spirals of survival." Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "meteor hush") risks coherence in dawn beats but pattern-taught. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Telepathic plants from anesthesia as displaced miracle transforms scar-erasure trope into fresh conceptual repricing. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via plant idiom, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
