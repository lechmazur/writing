<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's involuntary truthfulness constrains early merchant interaction and softens final girl exchange, earning the box-passing choice through consistent motivation to preserve wonder. Contradictory impulses (curse's torture vs. secret-keeping) act in scene via ascent despite routine dimness. Minor slip in told epiphany ("he knew he had done more") at closure slightly undercuts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wonder layers build via ascent, riddle unlock, poem discovery to Charged Poise closure in box handover and lamp flicker, reconfiguring loss into legacy with felt cost of relinquishing personal vessel. Orientation anchors Elias/tower/blackout by para 2. One tightening (poem reveal shifts log from feared dry report to magic) suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower ascent constrains physical choices (spiraling stairs echo determination); blackout desolation (drone carcasses, despair hum) mirrors internal stakes, evolving to nectar dusk charging final image. Sensory selectivity (honeyed glow, wind whisper narrowing to panel click) reflects Elias's biased priorities. Recurring tower/box integrate via goal-action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder amid routine failure) signaled early via box-clutch; accumulative deepening via poem discovery narrows to renunciation trade-off, agency in riddle use and handover foreclosing personal keepsake. Visible cost (box loss) alters to lighter heart, charging lamp image. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; girl complicates gently, not resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's endurance amid loss emerges organically from poem ("flickered out... sigh"), box evolution, final spark—resonant non-literal answer reweighting blackout premise without moralizing. Subtext in truthful admissions and wing relic invites ambiguity on noticing tragedy. Particulars (drone as fallen stars) avoid platitudes; irony in curse enabling gentle truth layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (wonder-filtered noticing: "gaunt frame," "nectar dusk") modulates rhythmically under ascent stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It is... beautiful"), goal-driven (girl's exhaustion prompts reveal). No head-hopping; diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects truthful soul's poetic earnestness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "clutched the lacquer box... small vessel of wonder" advances motive/atmosphere); rhythm varies (short clicks amid lush dusk). Minor overwriting in ascent metaphors ("honeyed glow," "soft lament") risks muddle but pattern-taught as tonal; no loops, scaffold, or closure artifacts. Read-aloud propulsion strong to lamp flicker.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truthful curse + drone-hive elegy + riddle-box ritual transforms post-blackout toll routine into wonder-preservation quest, inevitable in hindsight via architect's whimsy. Bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, perspective memorable via curse-box tension.</comment>
