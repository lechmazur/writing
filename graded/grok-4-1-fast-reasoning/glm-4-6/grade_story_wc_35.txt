<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in plunge despite contagion risk, compelling higher stakes; absorption earns change with embodied cost in "dull ache of general human suffering." Interiority particular via tasting memories and salt on tongue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as emotional density tightens from pool analysis to pavilion flood; closure RR lands on-page at finger-brush absorption with legible conceptual cost in merged remorse dulling specifics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools constrain entry via ripple method; bioluminescent coral and frost charge climax; final fortress image mirrors internal reconfiguration, evolving causally from rain to baking heat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to dull guilt signaled early, deepens accumulatively through memory flood narrowing to general ache; agency in touch forecloses specific pain with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of brittle facades emerges organically via fortress/pavilion parallel; final cooking image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting specific remorse into shared humanity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature (taste, touch primacy); diction/rhythm modulates from tremulous to crystalline at absorption, heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (sandpaper memories, seafoam remorse) taught early for accumulative payoff; zero loops, varied rhythm propels to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synesthesia-chef premise transforms guilt/redemption tropes via pavilion's physicalized remorse; risk in contagious touch heightens stakes organically to inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
