<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's forgiving skepticism drives pivotal micro-choices like sensing starlight manacles and handing over the tooth despite hesitation, with contradictory wariness and warmth embodied on the page. Child's ancient innocence pressures via revelation without stereotypes. Minor label-speak ("shrewdly innocent") slightly abstracts but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tooth sensitivity to garden intuition to tooth dissolution CR, reweighting substitute body as invitation with conceptual cost of expanded navigation (final paragraph). Orientation anchored early (ME office to estate); one tightening via child's message narrows certainty cleft. No causality breaks; cost legible in "cleft in certainty begin to heal... by expanding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hedge maze constrains navigation via touch/intuition; garden's impossible botany (crystallizing leaves, starlight branches) charges final inhalation/dimming, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (iridescent warmth, opalescent eyes) filters through Eleanor's scientific-wonder bias. Micro-object (tooth) as setting evolves to reconfigure closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve certainty cleft re: substitute body) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sparkle/manacles → maze yearning → child's anchor-shifting message, forcing tooth surrender with felt balance-restoration cost. Agency in journey and handover forecloses destruction path. Minor abstractness in "fundamentally wrong" declaration prefigures but doesn't fully viscerally test until garden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mistakes-as-constellations theme emerges from bone arrangement → stones → tooth dissolution without statement, resonant CR reweighting fractures as navigable (final lines). Subtext in child's "mistake that must become part of the pattern" lingers ambiguity. No moralizing; child's innocence complicates tidy forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scientific openness + Fae sensitivity: "faint sparkle... like Manacles of starlight"). Dialogue subtextual/goal-driven (child's "You kept it" calls across veil, pursues tooth). Rhythmic modulation under revelation pressure; minor filter ("seemed to inhale") voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., maze trail via fingers advances intuition beat); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("weeping willow whose branches dripped starlight," "mistakes could become constellations") accumulates texturally without muddling closure image. Clean syntax, specific diction (iridescence, opalescent).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fae-via-medical-examiner lens transforms changeling trope organically (tooth under tongue → bone setting anomaly → rebalancing); fresh shrewd innocence in child pressures certainty physics. Risky quiet CR (expanding cleft) inevitable from particulars; no template echoes.</comment>
