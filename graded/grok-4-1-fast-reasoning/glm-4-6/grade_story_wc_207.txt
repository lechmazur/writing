<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via scent obsession and psychometry; motivation intensifies to compel delve, earning worldview shift. Contradictory impulses in leaving vials show readiness cost. Final renunciation at lagoon feels character-bound, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: psychometry vision to descent density builds to CR closure (worldview hinge with cost of dissolved certainty). Orientation anchored early; one tightening at satchel/twin compass. Cost legible in "beautiful, terrifying expanse."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharp (petrichor to wet limestone to glowing water), limestone fissure constrains descent choice. Final lagoon charges image, mirroring internal hush. No white-room; tactile navigation lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mystery source) signaled early, deepens via psychometry reversal changing knowledge; agency in immersion forecloses rational explanations with conceptual cost. Lens escalation via density reweights to Charged Poise at water touch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from scent collection to mystery embrace via particulars (compass, lagoon); final image reconfigures premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity without moral. No sermonizing; resonance from "what if there isn’t?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (hush, scents as emotions); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density without elision opacity. Prose texture distinct, syntax embodies quest hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; minor figurative density (e.g., "fissure, a wound") purposeful, no muddle in peak immersion beat. No loops, scaffold, or drift; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry + petrichor to CR hush; transforms lost expedition trope via homing compass. Risky quiet epiphany inevitable from setup, no hedging.</comment>
