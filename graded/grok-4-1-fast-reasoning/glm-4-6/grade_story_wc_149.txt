<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in betrayal and debt, embodied in her spectral touches and his gasped memory; contradictory mournful elation acts in cameos leading to touch. Final recognition earned via bead's flare. Minor label-speak ("lovingly venomous") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cameo density builds to touch and flare, reconfiguring recognition with cost in her fade and his lingering grasp of warm bead ("The debt was paid... she faded"). Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page, options eternalized. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (jasmin/ash scent, cold kiss imprint, glowing vines intensify) mirrors internal states and charges final orchard hum. Recurring orchard constrains her drifts and his tending, shaping cameo tactics; micro-setting (luminous pomegranates) cues pivotal memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment/recognition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cameos to memory surfacing ("a woman with ash... promise broken") narrowing to impossible reunion. Agency in her approaches forces his gasp/reach; cost felt in fade and eternal promise, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent, venomous love emerges organically from betrayal memory, bead threads, and fade; final bead grasp ("felt her love... wrap around his heart") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting debt as curse/promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with ghostly perceptual signature (shimmer/veil imagery) modulating to his widened eyes; rhythmic poetic diction ("susurrus of regret") heightens pressure, consistent lyric texture under stress. No dialogue; elision of names purposeful for resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("moonlight on water" approaches) propels via varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs ("motes of phosphorescence... damp earth") slightly slows early beats, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical-ghost synthesis transforms gothic tropes via bead's etched symbols and orchard's responsive glow; risk-taking in accumulative lyric poise feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening eternal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
