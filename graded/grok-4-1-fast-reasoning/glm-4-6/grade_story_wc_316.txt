<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied numbness cracks convincingly at "heart rattled against his ribs, the numbness cracking like old ice," driving micro-choices; clone pressures as mirror crucible. Internal conflict of calm vs. raw emotion acts simultaneously in climax pour. Minor deduction for clone's one-note mirroring without deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: taunts → lunge → pedestal strike → will-pouring DC dissolves clone with bittersweet cost in final jar warmth and doubt. Orientation anchors instantly in dojo/void; single scene tightens meaningfully at brain glow. Closure reconfigures existence with legible isolation price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating dojo/void constrains edge perch and trembling interrupts fight; obsidian floor mirrors duality. Sensory thrum/tremble narrows under crisis, charging final stable night. Recurring void evolution mirrors internal fray to charged poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brain custody defeats numbness) signaled early, tightens via vivify narrowing clone's claim. Agency in palm-heel strike/pouring forecloses copy's path with clone flicker cost. Causal pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hollow self-victory emerges via brain glow repricing originality; final "colder certainty... alone with the truth" reweights numbness defeat non-literally. Subtext in clone taunt "fighting for a ghost" lingers ambiguously without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias on numbness/jar; dialogue subtext pursues custody ("You’re just a copy"). Rhythmic texture modulates to short gasps at climax; distinct clone idiom in sneer vs. Kael's low replies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/metaphor without muddle; rhythm accelerates in fight ("lunged... sidestepped... struck"). Minor metaphor strain ("brain sloshing like a dead sea") in peak but no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh clone custody via vivified brain transforms sci-fi tropes; history-rewrite frame risks bold synthesis tying ego death to authenticity. Final doubt image feels inevitable from duality setup without hedging.</comment>
