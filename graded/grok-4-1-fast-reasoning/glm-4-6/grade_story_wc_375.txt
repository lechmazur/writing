<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in earned resurgence when charcoal moves "with a life of its own," revealing hierarchy of values; minor epiphanic summary at end ("reclaimed his soul") slightly abstracts the closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory density builds to cathartic sketching torrent; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with cost in blunted charcoal and diminished painting; orientation anchored immediately in cave and artist's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choices (jagged wall, smooth stretch) and charges final image as "crystals now reflecting not tears but light"; sensory details (pulsing, humming, refracting) mirror internal shift purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim creativity vs. exile) signaled early and escalates accumulatively via pristine charcoal find to sketching release; agency in prying painting and rising to sketch forecloses exile path with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable callings emerges organically from box promise to final wings metaphor, reweighting self-exile without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure in emergence into "sharper" world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in charcoal-finger motif and lyrical rhythm modulating to cathartic torrent; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at resurgence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel to peak sketching beat; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("auroral sorrow, tears frozen, molten lava") dense but coherent without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse/blessing in crystal cave transforms artist's block trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically to wings-as-closure.</comment>
