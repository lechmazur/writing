<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied emotion (screaming tenderness in chest) drive micro-choices like channeling intent through cork; final calm as earned renunciation forecloses fragile resolve with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent density buildup to cork's impossible flight as Conceptual Repricing; cost legible in "screaming tenderness subsided into profound calm" after unburdening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse balcony constrains release as messenger spire; recurring cork and wind charge final image, with sensory shift from salt to phantom garden mirroring intent's proof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers via pure intent) tightens texturally as garden scent manifests, narrowing to cork release with agency in permission-giving; felt cost in emotional subsidence charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pure intent over force emerges organically via cork's flight reweighting shouts vs. whispers; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as currents, scents as nocturnal promise); rhythmic modulation peaks in release beat without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel ascent to climax; minor figurative density ("needle of intent threading horizon") risks slight overwrite but coheres in textural pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intent-powered flight via garden scent transforms lighthouse solitude trope; risk-taking in lyric proof heightens stakes organically.</comment>
