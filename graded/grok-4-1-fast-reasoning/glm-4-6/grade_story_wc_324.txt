<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria's curiosity drives consistent choices from photo to music box, with embodied pull in chest revealing motive under pressure; internal conflict limited to familiar grief-love tension without simultaneous impulses acting in scene, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from hearing aid pulses to music box discovery (DC closure via documents with conceptual cost of erasure undone); orientation anchored early in atrium; single tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight constrain work (boundary thins for signals) and charge final hush-to-relief image; sensory selection (hum, pulses) POV-filtered by professional priorities; no object constrains choice beyond micro-setting allowance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover photo truth) signaled early, tightens via strong pulses narrowing to compartment with agency-driven escalation; cost felt in protecting silenced voices, legible in final gratitude but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from curiosity yielding truth without moralizing; final image reweights erasure premise via cleared name; resonance from particulars avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (energy waves, pulses as voices); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.6<comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax, but minor paraphrase loop in "persistently curious" (twice) and elevated diction ("reeling hush") slightly dull peak reveal without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional forensics via hearing aid pulses for deaf woman transforms ghost story trope; risk in supernatural pulses grounded in specifics pays off at erasure reveal.</comment>
