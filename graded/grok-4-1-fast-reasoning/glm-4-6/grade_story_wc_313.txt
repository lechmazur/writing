<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in ritualistic vigilance and backstory salvage, with embodied actions like sipping the liqueur aligning traits under self-imposed burden. Interiority concrete in sensory details (anise and regret), but minor slips in abstract phrasing ("spin stories into shared meaning") dilute peak embodiment during photo placement. Final ritual fulfillment earns endurance with felt cost of chosen isolation, satisfying 9+ quick test partially but held by unearned epiphanic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory buildup (wind chime silence as pattern break) and held to Charged Poise closure: photos laid, water stirs, past resurfaces with conceptual cost of inevitable memory. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (warden, ridgeway, reservoir). Single continuous scene fits defaults; one tightening (silence signals veil thinning) narrows ritual options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment (reservoir edge, ridgeway gravel) constrains ritual choices and charges final image (photos as "stars fallen to earth"). Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (grinding boots hush to lapping sigh), filtered through warden's vigilant bias; recurring reservoir mirrors internal resurfacing without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (stone wall, oak) tethers actions tactilely, enabling 9+ via constraint on photo trail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard narrative boundary via ritual) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via silence break and deepening photo sequence narrowing to final placement with felt burden cost. Agency in precise ritual choices forecloses erasure path; water stirring crystallizes pressure coherently under lens. One meaningful cadence shift at edge approach suffices, entering 8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable past via storytelling emerges organically from photo trail and liqueur relic, reweighted in final image (town "resurfacing inevitable") without moralizing. Subtext in ritual's humane precision tensions expunging vs. voicing memory; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, satisfying quick test via non-literal answer charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (poetic hush motifs, biased to twilight reflections); rhythm modulates from patrol cadence to intensified silence. Purposeful compression in ritual beats legible under lens; diction controlled, perceptual bias character-specific without leakage. Experimental lyricism taught early, paid off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., flask sip embodies regret and relic); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion matches scene hush-to-stir. Minor overwrite in figurative density ("bruised moon," "veil thinned") across beats deducts slightly, but patterned (hush motifs) without muddle; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Template repetition of "sapphire-hued" voice-motivated as motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned-town trope via warden's photo-ritual reframing expunging as resurrection, with trail method transforming memory stakes organically. Bold lyric risk in silence/poise closure heightens conceptual cost without gimmick; particular details (chime signal, curling photos) feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
