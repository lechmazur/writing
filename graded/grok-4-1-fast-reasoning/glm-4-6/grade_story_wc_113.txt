<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies from discovery to playing cello, with embodied reactions like "heart racing" and "fingers itching"; internal shift from skeptic to collaborator earned via decoding. Closure choice to play honors legacy with cost to disbelief. Minor flaw: quick pivot from "dismissed such stories" without contradictory impulses shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (stains to symbols to notation) build density to RR closure (ghost bow, receding waters, clutched program) with conceptual cost to historical narrative. Single scene oriented early; one tightening via erratic lanterns signaling response. Cost legible in "disrupt the historical narrative forever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains (submerged seat, dry podium, rescued cello); lanterns flicker with decoding/play, charging closure image of dawn/recoding. Sensory mix (sloshing boots, rich tones in water) POV-filtered via musician; podium as micro-setting enables pivotal deciphering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher/play to honor Isabella) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via symbol patterns to agency in playing under lantern response; cost felt in isolation bridged, foreclosing skeptic path. Protagonist endurance disrupts narrative with visible theatre reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cross-time collaboration emerges via program images, play, ghost bow without statement; final image (nod to empty space, clutched program) non-literally answers inspiration's source with ambiguity on belief. Resonance from particulars like warped pages reweighting history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with musical perceptual signature ("unstruck chords," "rich tones"); diction/rhythm lyrical yet controlled, modulating to triumphant at play. No dialogue; elision of ghost words fits wordless tone, paid off in bow/nod.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density in decoding beat, varied rhythm; strong verbs ("waded," "retrieved"). Loops deduct: "water damage creating images" x3 verbatim, "wordless conversation" x3 paraphrase churn dulls some propulsion. Chinese insert "灵感(inspiration)" jars register at realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: water-revealed code in flooded pit enables ghost collab, transforming haunted trope via musical cipher. Risk in liminal "in between spaces" heightens stakes organically; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight from symbols to disruption.</comment>
