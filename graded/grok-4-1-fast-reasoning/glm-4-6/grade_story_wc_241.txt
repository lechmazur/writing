<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (logic vs. chaos) act in her scrawl collection and notebook presentation, earning the father's relational reconfiguration with felt emotional cost in his softened expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrawl density builds to notebook handoff; closure as Charged Poise in "You’ve widened my perspective" with legible conceptual cost in "tiny fractures in his certainty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mica lantern as micro-setting recurs to constrain her rebellious gesture and charge closure when father traces it, grounding rain-sensory atmosphere in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging logic/chaos) accumulates pressure through scrawl collection tightening to presentation test; agency in traversal forecloses doubt with father's admission as visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lucid contradictions emerge organically from scrawls to reweight probability vs. possibility without statement; resonant final image of notebook as "sacred text" answers thematic question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (gambler's eye on odds/scrawls) stable in single POV; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in father's hesitant "irresponsible" yielding to emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density ("roulette wheel," "house of cards") borders overwriting in reflective beats without obscuring closure, but "clover melancholy" repetition creates minor loop; rhythm propels otherwise cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subway scrawls as gambler's mosaic transforms father-daughter trope into fresh accumulative drive; risk in cryptic method heightens stakes organically toward widened-perspective closure.</comment>
