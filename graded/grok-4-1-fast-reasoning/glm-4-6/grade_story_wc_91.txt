<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving the detour and realization; interiority concrete in whispers to bottle but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final laughter reveals character under pressure effectively. Embodied emotions mostly poetic rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bug escape to relic discovery to bug return, culminating in CR where relics reprice transformation with conceptual cost in final smile and crunch. Orientation anchored early; no shards, single scene fits defaults. Closure legible on page in "gained everything" amid destitution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective—black sand, fissure glow, rumbles—constrains discovery via buried box and charges final crunch image. Sensory hierarchy (light pulses, hush, wind gust) mirrors urgency; volcano rumble evolves causally. Micro-setting (bottle, stone) guides choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, tightens via accidental bug escape narrowing to fissure pursuit under textural lens. Agency in following yields relic payoff with felt gain amid ongoing destitution. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost in fragile eternity reweights end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of accidental transformation emerges organically from bug/relic arc, final image repricing premise as "fragile and eternal" without moralizing. Subtext in coincidences charges irony; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers in island's applause. Recurring hush shifts from anticipation to affirmation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in hushed, pulsing observations; voice lyrical and biased toward cosmic patterns. Rhythm modulates with intensity, syntax purposeful. No dialogue; elision of mechanics taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, but minor loops in "whispering hush"/"vibrant hush" repetitions slightly dull propulsion without full pattern payoff. No major artifacts, metaphors consistent (moth/flame irony). Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coincidence gift, bug cosmos, petrified relics transforms philanthropy trope into textural revelation; volcanic hush setting inflects uniquely. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from early signals.</comment>
