<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "thumb tracing the groove where the screw had turned countless times" and tears "hot and silent"; contradictory trembling/steady impulses act in scene, earning final firm hands via causal buildup to inscription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to inscription "*L. 1923.*" as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting numbness to hope; legible cost in "phantom ache of absence" and tears; single scene anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Screw as micro-setting constrains discovery via loupe and charges closure as "compass"; water clock drip evolves causally (mirrors emotion, ties to final fix); fog lifts purposefully, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil via screw amid scent loss) signaled early, textural escalation peaks at inscription tightening knowledge/options; agency in examination, cost legible in tears and foreclosed numbness charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden ordinary miracles emerges via screw's nicks/inscription shifting to hope without statement; final "faintest hint of cedar" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with scent-biased perceptual signature even in absence; rhythmic control modulates from hushed fog to steady drip; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("light fractured through glass"); minor paraphrase loop in tremble/tremor phrasing dulls one beat but purposeful for tone; no closure artifacts, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapy loss, midwife screw inscription, water clocks transforms grief trope; inscription turn inevitable from particulars, risk in occluded loupe view heightens closure.</comment>
