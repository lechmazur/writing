<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via buckle relic and bark tracing, embodying motivation to preserve trust; micro-choices like rechecking knots reveal values under isolation pressure. Mild internal conflict in wondering if patterns are real vs. longing, but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously at jump. Final endurance earned by buildup, with solitude as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/pattern motifs builds to cadence shift at voice calling name post-jump, reconfiguring burden as earned trust (Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of perpetual watching). Orientation anchored early (seeker on arbor, post-static). Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bark spirals and parachute harness constrain jump choice; fog sea and thin air charge isolation, mirroring internal patterns. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to tactile (buckle cool, harness bite) under crisis. Final arbor shrinking recharges opening perch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (watcher's burden/trust preservation) signaled early, tightens via static-to-voice shift forcing leap; jump agency forecloses safe watching with solitude cost. Accumulative escalation via motif density reweights isolation into charged connection without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of trust earned amid void emerges organically from buckle betrayal/reclamation and pattern-seeking; final "one leap at a time" image resonantly reconfigures burden without stating moral. Repeated "watcher’s burden" risks echo but ties to jump closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: chaos parsed into patterns (constellations, bark spirals). Rhythmic prose modulates tension, compressing at jump ("snap"); purposeful lyric elision taught early via silence pays off in voice break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., buckle traces ritual/motivation), varied rhythm suits lyric mode; opening anchors stakes via perch. Paraphrase loops in silence descriptors ("profound... vacuum... whispers") and "watcher’s burden" repetition dull momentum (-0.8); no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pattern-seeker on cloud-arbor with relic buckle transforms solitude trope into trust ritual; jump voice reweights via muscle memory without late rules. Bold lyric risk heightens isolation stakes coherently.</comment>
