<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in clutching charm and gasping post-wave, with uncertainty yielding to unwavering belief via micro-choices in narration; internal conflict surfaces in "uncertain but unwavering" under submersion pressure. Minor slip in end-epiphany phrasing feels slightly unearned, but change forecloses oblivion path with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pockmark narrations build density toward CR closure in statue's golden transformation; wave crash provides one meaningful tightening, reweighting stakes with submersion cost felt in unspoken narration. Orientation anchored early in workshop/acid sea; no causality breaks, cost legible in final realization line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (acidic crashes, thrumming gears, warming charm) filters through alchemist's priorities, constraining choices during tilt/submersion; workshop hull and statue pockmarks charge final image, evolving causally with acid threat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend statue/conjure meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via wave-forced underwater narration narrowing options; agency in persistent storytelling yields charged poise closure with oblivion-edge cost felt in process endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-as-strength emerges organically via golden repairs and memory-weaving, resonating in final statue enhancement without overt moralizing; subtext in charm absorbing acid reweights prior imperfections. Minor friction from "beauty lives not in perfection" line bordering explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in alchemical noticing (pockmarks as memory-craters); rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, compressing effectively underwater. No head-hopping or withholding; voice particular to uncertain narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; minor loops in "golden" and "between breaths" motifs cohere thematically without obscuring closure. No major artifacts; propulsion strong in wave beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi alchemy on acid sea transforms familiar repair trope via memory-matching and oblivion edge; risk in lyric accumulative narration heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via charm-statue-workshop integration.</comment>
