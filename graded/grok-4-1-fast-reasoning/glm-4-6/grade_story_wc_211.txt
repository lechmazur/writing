<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to archive patterns intensifies compellingly into immersion choice at "he would immerse himself fully," earned via prophecy cascade; embodied emotions like "velvet disquiet" and "sharp terror" particularize internal conflict. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously before decision prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from cylinder discovery to emotional cascade, landing CR closure in "boundary between himself and the archived promises dissolved" with legible conceptual cost of self-transformation. Single tightening via foot striking cylinder narrows to prophecy; orientation anchored early at orchard atop Needle Spire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard garden setting charges final image as "olive leaves rustled in unison" synchronizing with immersion; engineered soil and greenhouse dome constrain via "impossible soil" preserving cylinder. Sensory details like "overripe persimmon" filter through Elias's priorities, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. awakening archives signaled early, tightens accumulatively via prophecy revealing "emotional patterns... growing entities"; agency in pressing cylinder forecloses prior life with felt neural rewrite cost. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation transforming to rebirth emerges organically from particulars like archived promises gaining mass; final image of Elias as "vessel for their rebirth" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise. Subtext in prophecy warning layers ambiguity meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature via dead-language lens on "micro-grooves formed a dialect of emotional encoding"; rhythmic control modulates to compression at immersion peak. Lyrical diction purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with sentences like "fingers remembering languages that had ceased breathing" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors during prophecy cascade ("cascade of feelings: first the velvet disquiet") dings without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizing oath scribes archiving emotions via dead languages into wax prophecy feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in neural transmission transform elevates, with orchard-skyscraper fusion organic to transformation closure.</comment>
