<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Julian's thoughtful persistence shines through micro-choices like squeezing the drawer pull during tension, earning his final untethering with embodied contradiction between past guilt and present resolve; minor label-speak ("uncommonly thoughtful") slightly abstracts without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via symbol density building to Charged Poise closure in final image of drawer pull and untethering, with legible emotional cost ("finally allowed himself to untether"); orientation anchored early, one tightening via exchange execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist, wind, and parapet constrain choices (steadying Mellor as wind intensifies) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (salt whispers, moon illumination) filters through Julian's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exchange for peace/redemption) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via arrival and Mellor's words revealing method's reach; cost felt in Julian's steadying action and personal release, coherent under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically from drawer pull motif shifting to wisdom, resonant in final image; minor overtness ("recycling mistakes into wisdom" as mantra) borders thematic echo, softening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tactile symbols like warming brass); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("And the apology?"), advances without exposition; rhythmic modulation heightens hush under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figurative pattern (mist fingers, celestial timekeepers) taught early; minor density overload in opening mist descriptions risks overwriting but spares closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-phase sync and drawer pull as redemption talisman transforms prisoner exchange trope; risk in lyric reflection pays off in inevitable final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
