<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elian's motivation from grief to teaching blooms authentically through crafting and student network, with embodied silver-stained hands and phoenix vine stencil revealing character under loss; internal conflict layers despair with subdued purpose without tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from personal grief to timeline-spanning network; CR closure in final observatory image reconfigures loss as purpose with felt cost of transformed legacy; orientation anchored early in dome and staircase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Timeless observatory with shifting maps and telescope constrains choices like etching stencils and folding flowers, charging final image as monument/workshop; sensory details like echoing footsteps and lantern light filter through Elian's grief-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-to-purpose tightens accumulatively through student chain to era-spanning observatories, narrowing from personal memorial to collective mission; cost legible in repurposed hands that still memorialize loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of withering-to-blooming emerges organically from jewelry-to-origami evolution and student legacy, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer via "genuinely artificial became authentically true"; ambiguity lingers in transformation's ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in silver stains and phoenix vines; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet climb to expansive network without head-hopping; single character voice coherent and biased toward memorial details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; minor overwriting in "curtains of intention" block with thick metaphors slightly dulls propulsion, but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image of hands cultivating hope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry into time-bending coordinates network transforms grief tropes through "genuinely artificial" flowers and phoenix vines; risk-taking in timeless observatory premise heightens stakes inevitably toward legacy reconfiguration.</comment>
