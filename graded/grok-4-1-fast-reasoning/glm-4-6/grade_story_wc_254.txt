<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in aesthetic drive and past studies compels the dissolution choice at climax, with embodied emotions in blurring form; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, but change in sloughing old self feels earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to reformation; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with legible cost in "his old self slough away like morning mist," reconfiguring perspective without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "humming quartz colonnade... strings of a cosmic cello" constrain the pivotal palm-pressing choice and charge final atrium image; POV-biased hierarchy sharpens poet's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to cross boundary tightens via intent-matching frequency, narrowing to dissolution with agency in "stepped forward"; cost felt in irrevocable reformation, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving boundaries to embody them emerges organically from failed paraphrasing to direct merger, with final image of shadow as "final, fleeting masterpiece" offering resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "lantern-moth hush"; rhythmic control modulates from approach to expansion, no head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in dissolution sequence, with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peak ("light and sound") borders overwriting but pattern-taught and legible, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic transformation fantasy transforms boundary-crossing trope via quartz hum and aesthetic intent; risk-taking in lyric dissolution heightens stakes organically.</comment>
