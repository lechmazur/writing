<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ancient role compels ritual choices with embodied weight in bones and heart; strength in consistent traits and earned endurance via vigil. Minor weakness: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating micro-choices beyond serene competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from approach to scattering to sprouting; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with luminescent roots reconfiguring loss into renewal, cost legible in solitary vigil till dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight constrains ritual placement and charges final image via trembling flowers and sprouting roots; sensory details (rattling pods, tern cries, tide rhythm) selectively filtered through coachman's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoration signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tern cry prompting scatter and tide enabling renewal; agency in precise seeding forecloses forgetting with vigil cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony's resurrection emerges organically from ritual particulars; final sprouting image offers resonant non-literal answer to submersion, reweighting narrow vastness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (dead languages, bird messages); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual poise, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm varying sentence lengths; minor overwriting in stacked figures ("hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow") slightly muddles peak density but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral coachman ferrying ecological promises transforms tropes via seed-ritual myth; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens reclamation stakes organically.</comment>
