<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "selfish and sacred" quest intensifies through embodied sensations, earning internal shift; contradictory impulses subtle but present in swaying under pull vs. practiced focus. Final realization ("quiet blaze that consumed his fear, his grief, his longing") feels earned without unearned epiphany. Minor cliché in "he finally saw" dings perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: notes density builds chaos to harmony, tightening at third-note crescendo ("B flat that struck him like a physical blow"). CR closure on-page with cost in consumed emotions; orientation anchored early in forest sensations. No ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and ring constrain dowsing choices via tremors/notes, charging final image ("platinum ring...cooled, its work done"). Sensory hierarchy blind-specific (vibrations, tastes); evolves from chaos to whisper mirroring internal arc. Body-as-setting (palms, tongue, feet) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet soul's storm) signaled early, escalates via note accumulation under Accumulative lens, one tightening at crescendo foreclosing external quest. Agency in dowsing/endurance; cost legible in kneeling/gasp and final emotional consumption. Fits length with coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of internal mapping emerges organically from dowsing failure-to-realization, resonant CR in "map...of the world within." Final image reweights external search without moralizing; ambiguity in "quiet blaze" invites reflection. No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with blind perceptual signature (skin/tongue/chest sensations); rhythmic prose modulates from swirling chaos to whisper. Diction sensory-biased, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice distinct, prose-as-character reflects mapmaker's attuned mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short gasps amid swells); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts even in peak crescendo beat. Figuratives consistent ("liquid sunlight," "lover’s sigh") without muddle; propulsion aligns with emotional build. Minor overwriting in openings but clean at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind dowsing via skin-absorbed notes transforms sensory tropes into emotional cartography. Risky lyric fantasy commits fully, with CR turn inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; "ultrasonic forest" angle bold and coherent.</comment>
