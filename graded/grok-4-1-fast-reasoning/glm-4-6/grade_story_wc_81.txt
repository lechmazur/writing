<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's traits drive feverish indexing and hypothesis, with embodied reactions like "heart quickened" and "fingers trembled" revealing stakes; minor label-speak in "tranquilly perceptive nature" slightly undercuts interior specificity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-building discoveries to CR closure ("There never was a flood"); stamp-heating coordinates propel causality with legible cost in framework readjustment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Watery dome and candlelight constrain choices (heating stamp) and charge final image ("sun filtered through water, casting dancing patterns across his notes"); sensory selection reflects logical focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace origins) deepens accumulatively via stamp revelation narrowing to intentional design; feverish corroboration shows agency with felt cost in trembling documentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent preservation emerges organically from engineering evidence and final sunlit notes reweighting disaster narrative; no moralizing, resonant without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tuned to overlooked details (octopus motif); rhythmic prose modulates from calm observation to urgent whispers, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action and image; minor figurative density ("dappled—wavering but persistent") and "readjust" repetition slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Intentional underwater sanctuary inverts sunken-city trope through stamp's engineering reveal; fresh synthesis of preservation motif heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
