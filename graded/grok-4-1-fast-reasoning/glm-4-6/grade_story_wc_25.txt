<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted in Kael's obsession with maps/coin, compelling the bet test; handing coin shows earned renunciation with relational cost. Jenna's quick awe-to-laughter lacks embodied contradiction or status depth. No strong internal impulses acting simultaneously in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: coin/maps/key chain to whisper test therefore chamber opening (DC) with opportunity cost of forfeited coin. Orientation anchors early (Kael in labyrinth, storm). One tightening via Jenna's arrival narrows to proof moment; closure legible with felt generosity cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Labyrinth/shipping containers vividly constrain navigation and acoustics, mirroring internal discovery; storm hum charges coin and final image. Sensory hierarchy (humming, crackling, boot treads) reflects Kael's priorities. Recurring containers guide choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whisper theory/win coin) signaled early, tightens via on-page test narrowing to chamber entry. Kael's agency forecloses rivalry path with coin forfeiture cost. Pressure coheres causally but lacks deeper moral calculus or loss complicating tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of "labyrinth listens/secrets unfold" emerges organically via acoustics/proof, reweighted in chamber image and "invitations" realization without statement. Final reprise of glowing coin/settling storm offers resonant CR on hidden depths. Subtext in whisper vs. shout lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (labyrinth as "alive"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Ready to lose?"/"You win"), advances proof. Rhythmic texture modulates with storm intensity; distinct voices in banter. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., coin glows/identifies); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in opener ("steel giants"/"shadows recoiling") risks muddle but integrates; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Clean mechanics support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: zodiac coin detecting walks via storm hum transforms labyrinth tropes into acoustic puzzle. Ingenious key-as-seam payoff grows from maps/coin pattern. Risks acoustics theory boldly, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
