<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve moments through ink drives all choices, with embodied "haunted euphoria" layering joy and ache in contradictory impulses during documentation. Final renunciation of the locket earns closure via prior causality. No unearned epiphanies; traits constrain without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to CR closure where locket placement reconfigures covenant with conceptual cost (transcendence via loss). Orientation anchored early; pattern taught via ritual. No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty's luminous flowers constrain ritual and charge final image ("flower slowly folded around the silver"). Sensory details (walnut-ink stains, ethereal glow) filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with tide. Micro-setting (conservatory jars) mirrors preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant renewal via documentation) tightens accumulatively through memory deepening, narrowing to locket sacrifice with felt cost. Agency in "dipping his brush" and final step-back forecloses path. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-loss emerges organically from ink work and flower enfolding locket, reweighting love as bridge without moralizing. Final image answers "context changes" non-literally. Complexity in acceptance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (ink-traced locket, memory clarity). Prose texture modulates rhythmically from twilight sway to moonlight closure. No head-hopping; elision of dreams anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "brush into the walnut-ink"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("small moments," "gently thorough") but purposeful, not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink-archiving and blooming covenant transforms loss tropes; jetty's regeneration risks bold world-logic fully committed to closure. Non-obvious reprise of flower/locket inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
