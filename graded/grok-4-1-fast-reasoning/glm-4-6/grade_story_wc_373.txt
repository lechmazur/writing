<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in inheritance and father's death intensifies through failed attempts, compelling higher-stakes diversion; interiority embodied in heart rhythm and "comforting unease," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning on summary over scene conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages in three failed attempts narrowing to successful diversion; on-page DC closure as recording captures confession just before sunrise rays, with legible cost in timed desperation and fragile community preserved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rotting pier and lantern-lit bazaar anchor early, with glinting fob and canvas tent constraining slips and recordings; sensory details like echoing threats mirror internal shadows without overt symbolism, charging final slanted beams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to record betrayal escalates causally via two failures forcing diversion agency; tightening forecloses disguise/live approaches, with visible cost in mounting desperation and revealed patricide charging climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken trust vs. preserved hush emerges organically from false starts to evidentiary prize; final decision reweights community fragility without moralizing, resonant via father's murder reveal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward shadows and rhythms; distinct texture in syntax evokes era, but minor withholding of fob's recording function early creates unearned suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short peak sentences at diversion, high density integrates action; minor paraphrase loops in "false starts" and "truce of hush" repetitions dull mid-section momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonshine underworld with recording fob invention transforms prohibition tropes; false starts method risks repetitive structure but earns ingenuity through timed sunrise payoff.</comment>
