<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arthur's trait of hearing unspoken words roots motivation and enables concrete micro-choices, like smiling at the baker's unvoiced concern before it forms, compelling his endurance in fragile hope; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (chessboards, mirrors, question marks) builds to Charged Poise closure in rippling unspoken words reconfiguring town consciousness, with conceptual cost legible in "fragile hope" line; orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto and cobalt library constrain choices (amplifies ability, hosts planning) and charge final image (windows echoing grotto's resonance); sensory details like mist and starlight selectively mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of subtle rebellion tightens via planning-to-activation deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to fragile success; cost felt in baker's doubt and final cradled hope, driven by Arthur's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet questions transforming power emerges organically from chess puzzles without solution and final rippling curiosity; ending image offers non-literal resonance ("world shifting beneath their feet") reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (unspoken words as "wind through wheat") modulates poetically; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing via Arthur's prescient reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences at midnight activation), high density integrates action/image; minor repetition of "unspoken words" and "hush" phrases mildly dulls but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic coach's window-display rebellion transforms quiet insurgency trope via chess motifs and textural buildup; risk of poetic subtlety pays off in resonant, inevitable close.</comment>
