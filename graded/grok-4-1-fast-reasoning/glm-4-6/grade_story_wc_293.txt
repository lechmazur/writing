<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shows concrete observation in scaffold discovery, but realizations like "the truth struck her then" feel unearned without embodied contradiction, softening pivotal motivation shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via discovery density (flake to map to fragments); CR closure lands on-page in final shimmer and purpose with felt cost of disbelief-to-role reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early at bridge/pullout. Shard transitions legible ("days passed," "months passed").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain pullout and scaffold flutters constrain choices (daily scanning, deciphering); recurring bridge charges final image as performance site. Sensory selection (wind snapping, mist) reflects fiddler urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve vanishings) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through fragment assembly narrowing to bridge-role; agency in nightly play/examining forecloses disbelief with time cost (months passed).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of bridging "never" to possibility emerges via flake shifts and final melody; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing, though "pixelated amnesty" line borders echo (−0.3). Particulars like faces drive without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (music/landscape fusion: "notes echoing like water"); rhythmic texture modulates to charged poise in closing play. Hitchhiker line natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Density high but minor loops ("luminous disbelief," "bridge-song") and paraphrase ("knew better—her motivation had shifted") drag momentum; figurative density coherent until scaffold "revealing and concealing" strains slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing tropes via wet-plate pixels and scaffold map into fresh conceptual engine; final fiddle-shimmer synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
