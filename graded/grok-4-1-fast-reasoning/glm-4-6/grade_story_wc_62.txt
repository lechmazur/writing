<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority via tactile carving ("retraced the newly carved path with his fingertip") and embodied grief mapping; motivation to discover collective grief intensifies through spectral cues. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses limits to strong rather than exceptional; endurance of meditative focus earns change without raw conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: image density builds from chisel grooves to migration carving, yielding on-page Conceptual Repricing ("shape of grief wasn't an endpoint but a passage") with felt cost in settled weight. Single continuous scene oriented by para 1; no micro-turns needed, closure legible without causal force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (humid air, monarch flutters, dying light) constrains meditative choices and charges final image ("cathedral of life and death"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (rhythm better than heartbeat). Environment evolves causally with dusk, mirroring internal migration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover grief's shape) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ribbon knot memory and path carving, narrowing to Charged Poise realization; cost felt in foreclosed static monument view. One tightening sufficient under lens; agency in deliberate chisel choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief as migratory current emerges organically from ribbon, butterflies, carving; final image (ribbon unrolled as offering, composing poem) reweights particulars non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from paradox of dying wings/seedlings, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (meditative noticing: "flutter... rhythm he knew better than his own heartbeat"); rhythmic modulation fits thundering calm tone, lyrical compression taught early. No dialogue; voice particular without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "spectral mentorship had begun weeks ago... specific knot" anchors backstory via cue); varied rhythm passes ear test. Paraphrase loops around "ribbon" and "retrace" (3+ instances) dull mid-section propulsion by -0.8; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, spectral ribbon guidance transforms grief trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via paradox. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established images; no derivative echoes.</comment>
