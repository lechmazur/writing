<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's archivist traits drive precise debris-arranging under visionary pressure, earning his final renunciation with embodied cost (diary tattooed on ribs). Contradictory impulses surface in descent despite warnings, shown via trembling hands and staggering retreat. Minor slip: epiphanic "truth seared into soul" borders unearned, but anchored in prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal actions elicit shape responses; textural visions accumulate) holds to CR closure: diary pages reveal lagoon's nature, reweighting premise with ongoing pull (parley never over). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (zeppelin, lagoon). One tightening: "WHY?" kelp elicits "THEY BURY US," narrowing to final "REMEMBER" with felt trap-loosening cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dunes, obsidian lagoon, and debris constrain choices (scavenged for messages) and charge closure (circle around zeppelin's shadow). Sensory hierarchy via Elias: archivist notices letter origins ("P" from shipwreck). Evolves causally (ripples, names crawling surface); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth vs. memory-trap) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven messages under Hybrid lens: debris replies force deepening (visions of activist's end), culminating in renunciation with cost (soul-searing, weakened pull). Visible price: diary bleeds ink as penance. Coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of history's encrypted voices emerges via debris dialogues and visions, resonant CR in final image (debris unreadable but unforgettable, love leaves patterns). Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (parley never over). Recurring lagoon reweights from lure to tender tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ciphered histories tint debris reading); voice modulates rhythmically from precise ("jagged edges") to visionary blur under stress. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Patience"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via diary trap.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.8<comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (ink bleeding like penance), but minor overwrite in peak visions ("searing reverie" echoes dilute propulsion); no loops. Rhythm varies (short "WHY?" kelp sentences accelerate). Clean mechanics propel to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive diary + debris-parley transforms archivist trope into memory-ledger premise, inevitable in hindsight (activist's zeppelin callbacks). Risky nonlinear visions heighten stakes without gimmick; no template echoes.</comment>
