<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentimentalist's vow drives non-violent integration of gear, earning "joy and loss" with embodied tremble and blurring form; contradictory impulses act in gentle placement versus urge to disrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from garden cycles to gear-amplified evolution; CR closure lands in "new order, one less forgiving" with conceptual cost of quantified emotion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains via faltering rhythm and shivering petals at sonar; recurring petals/blossoms charge final evolved blooms, though "Canada edges" jars as proofreading artifact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to preserve chaos tightens accumulatively with gear's glowing acceleration and sonar metronome forcing integration; agency weaves light, paying cost of altered patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Organic vs. mechanical theme emerges from gear meshing stem to "petals a new equation of beauty"; final image reconfigures sentiment without literal moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cosmic perceptual signature ("petals a note in an endless lullaby") modulates consistently; rhythmic prose apt for lyric mode, stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors dense in every opening sentence ("blossoms of gas and light drifted like silent prayers") blur propulsion; "quiet sigh" paraphrases thrice; "Canada edges" typo dulls specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh sentimentalist-gear synthesis in nebula transforms cosmic tropes; risk of poetic machinery heightens stakes in precise-edged blooms.</comment>
