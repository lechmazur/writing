<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to liberate her mentor roots consistently in traits like lyrical decryption, with embodied contradiction (heart races amid calm) driving micro-choices like continuing the dance before guards. Final success feels earned via prior causality in dance and journal. Minor slip in occasional stock phrasing like "calm defiance was a shield," but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal dance decryption + textural motif accumulation) holds; single scene orients early (underwater lab descent). Closure DC via code completion/phoenix image with felt cost (alarm/escape urgency). Guards and web provide one tightening without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water pressure, visor, waterproof journal constrain dance/actions; dice/journal as micro-settings charge final image (dice beside journal). Sensory hierarchy (water muting voice, rhythmic clicking) filters via POV urgency. No white-room; evolves causally with alarms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate mentor) signaled early, tightens via guards/web nearing completion under hybrid lens, forcing endurance/renunciation of pause. Agency in dance/journal/dice yields DC; cost legible in timed escape/alarm. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-resistance/oppression-to-liberation emerges via dance motifs shifting to phoenix; subtext in dice/journal implies prepared chance. Final journal entry reweights without moralizing. Complexity lingers in vulnerability-strength pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (dance as code, symbols deciphered). Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, matching lyrical breaker; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays at closure. No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/metaphor (dance algorithms purposeful, not overwriting in peak); rhythm varies, no loops/templates. Minor figurative density in climax ("blue streams," "phoenix rising") but pattern-taught and legible. Propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dance cryptography + symbolic dice in underwater regime lab transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; final image inevitable from established patterns. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
