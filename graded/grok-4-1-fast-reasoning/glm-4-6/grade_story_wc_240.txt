<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied spatial awareness and motivation rooted in obsession with boundaries, shown through mapping light/shifts; internal conflict emerges in shift from watching to connecting. Weakness: epiphany at "We should work together" feels swift without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat, diluting earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of imagery and pursuit builds to Charged Poise CR in final realization/reconfiguration of letting go, with conceptual cost of abandoning solitary theory legible in "he’d been wrong" and collaboration. Orientation anchored early in farm/misty aisles; single scene coherent, no shard issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms and spores as micro-setting constrain pursuit (trailing red dot through phosphorescent curtains) and charge closure image of pulsing farewell. Sensory hierarchy (glow, mist, earth/electricity) filtered through spatial POV bias; evolves causally with intensification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pursuit/meeting to realization narrowing solitary options; agency in following/collaborating forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. Escalation mild—one deepening via her laser insight—but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of permeable barriers/letting go emerges organically from spores, gazes, laser-traced gaps; final image of floating spores reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in "familiar strangers" lingers with ambiguity; minor friction from direct articulation like "physics of letting go" echoing too on-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with spatial perceptual signature (mapping ripples/air); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to intensity in meeting. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("You’re always watching"), distinct idioms; no head-hopping, diction fits introspective specialist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in pursuit), high density integrates action/atmosphere; strong verbs/specific nouns propel. Weakness: minor overwrite in repeated "quiet wildfire" and stacked metaphors (velvet leaking secrets) in opening beat dull early propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mushroom farm as boundary lab, laser measuring gaps, spatially gifted specialist pursuing abstract physics; transforms tropes (mysterious woman, revelation) via lived spore imagery and conceptual pivot. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
