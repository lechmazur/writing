<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied curse drives isolation and micro-choices like trembling fingers on final stone; contradictory visions vs. reality act in scene. Minor weakness: climax epiphany "understanding flooded her mind" borders unearned without deeper internal friction shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from stone arrangement to dust resonance; on-page CR closure in transcribing equations before destabilization, with legible cost in "sequence would destabilize within minutes."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains via past collapse risk, aurora supplies resonant energy charging climax; body/tools like satchel and stones filter through her priorities, evolving with events to final glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand patterns signaled early, tightens accumulatively through successful dust settling vs. past failures; agency in sprinkling/merging forecloses observer path with destabilization cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in negative spaces emerges organically from dust settling "between the stones"; final image of transcribed equations offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via curse-shaped visions ("futures that never quite aligned"); rhythmic control modulates from setup precision to climax intensity, stable single POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism, but opening stacked metaphors ("shimmering curtains... liquid silver... pulsing rhythmically") verge on overwriting without pattern payoff; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless world, eel herding, and cosmic ritual transformed via negative-space realization; risk-taking in accumulative CR heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
