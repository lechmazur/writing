<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in past arson regret compels painting progression to redemptive closure; contradictory impulses (destroy vs create) act in final burning act. Interiority concrete via "volcanic tenderness," embodied in stained fingers and tears. Minor flaw: reflective summary slightly abstracts peak emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of fragment discoveries and paintings tightens to map reveal and scroll burning as Decisive Change with absolution cost legible in "freeing the promise from the weight of history." Orientation anchored early in shed. One meaningful deepening via final defaced portrait suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("dust and forgotten ink," waterfall cave) filter through artist's bias, constraining choices via archive fragments that recur and charge final murals. Environment mirrors internal resilience (shattered mirror restoration). Micro-setting (paints, linen) shapes tactics without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (promise/redemption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through painting beats narrowing to hidden library; agency in restorations forces trade-off, culminating in scroll burning with felt emotional price. Cost legibility peaks in ashes scattering, reweighting past arson.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creation over destruction emerges organically from vandalized portraits restored, reweighted in final burning as freeing act; resonant non-literal answer in "archives and murals would fade, but the story...would remain." No moralizing, ambiguity in fire's dual role lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (analytical eye tracing faint map lines); voice texture poetic yet controlled ("slow, volcanic tenderness of cooling lava"). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in painting beats, but paraphrase loops ("painted...added," repeated fragment descriptions) and "acntmporary" typo dull density; metaphor coherence holds (volcanic fire motif) without muddle at closure. Minor scaffold in repetitive "trail" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist restores defaced civilization self-portraits uncovering map-promise, transforming destruction trope via art trail to absolution; risk in fire reprise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
