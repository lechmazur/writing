<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between crisis actor and survivor impulses, embodied in kneeling at chessboard despite composure; final purpose crystallization earned via prior trauma anchors. Minor flaw: diagnostic label-speak in "nomadic penumbra" risks abstraction, but present micro-choices (tracing words) tilt it forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure in final "gesture" walk, reweighting her penumbra as method with conceptual cost of bearing memories; orientation anchored early in rotunda. Single scene fits defaults; no micro turns disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery and dust constrain her word-tracing method, charging closure image; chessboard pawns as micro-setting evolve from troubling absence to invitation. Sensory acoustics amplify breathing/prayer purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document gestures) deepens accumulatively via chessboard kneel, foreclosing performance-for-authenticity path with felt trauma cost; interregnum pressure coheres without reversal need. Pivotal kneel tests commitment legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of luminous absences emerges organically from pawn voids and dust words, resonant CR in final line reweighting histories without moralizing. Pawn metaphor shifts from forgotten many to human invitation, tying arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in gesture-noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from reverent to prayer-like in gallery echoes. No dialogue; diction controlled, perceptual bias consistent under reflective stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., footsteps as statement); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops though minor penumbra paraphrase. Slight overwriting in metaphors clusters pre-kneel, but coherence intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of actor/survivor via dust-spelling and pawn voids transforms gesture-history premise; risk in lyric walking method heightens stakes organically. Final "luminous absence" reconfiguration inevitable from priors.</comment>
