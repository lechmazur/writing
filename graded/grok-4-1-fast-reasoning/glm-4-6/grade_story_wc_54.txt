<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sextant relic compels actions like valve-turn, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in pivotal water-flow beat; interiority concrete in "hands smudged with grease" yet tilts generic with label-speak like "functionally creative nature."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dry pipes to shimmering equations; Charged Poise closure in "maze...become a map" reconfigures abandonment with conceptual cost of ongoing work legible in final pocket image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hydroponics bay pipes constrain redirection choice and charge final pattern image; sensory details like "rust and memory" smell filtered through engineering POV bias purposefully evolve with causal water flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope equations signaled early tightens accumulatively via water intensification narrowing decay options; mild pressure in valve resistance shows agency, but lacks visceral trade-off charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of engineered hope emerges organically from water-traced particulars to resonant final image answering renewal without moralizing; no overt statements, ambiguity lingers in "work...just beginning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with engineering-perceptual signature like "mapping faded pathways"; rhythmic syntax modulates from precise actions to lyric closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overfigurative overwriting in peak water-flow beat ("language of renewal," "weaving...veins," "sliver of captured star") muddles with mixed vehicles; minor paraphrase loops in final paras rephrasing success dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant relic engineering hope equations in sci-fi decay transforms abandonment trope; risk-taking in abstract "maze of intentions" as concrete pattern pays off inevitably at closure.</comment>
