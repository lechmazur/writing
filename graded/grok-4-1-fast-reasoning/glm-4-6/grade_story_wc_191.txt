<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in family legacy, compelling the risky journey; embodied reactions like trembling fingers and racing heart ground emotions. Lacks deeper internal contradiction or flawed impulses acting simultaneously at climax—peeling feels competent without visible struggle. Final realization earned but lacks micro-choice revealing value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: flake's pulse → decoding → sallying → peeling → embedding → ascension with CR closure as throne reconfigures origins premise, cost in fading temple and patient wait. Orientation anchored early in workspace. One tightening via waterfall plunge narrows options before payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard constrain plunge choice and charge final prisms-on-orchard image; murals' paint layers force tactile peeling under timed pressure. Sensory hierarchy fits lore keeper bias toward ancient over chrome horizon. Details evolve causally, mirroring realization without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/find stairway before purge) signaled early, tightens causally via guards/waterfall/peeling, forcing agency in plunge and ascent. Escalation coherent under causal lens with time narrowing options; cost legible in exile risk and foreclosed power grab. Protagonist decisions drive turns to CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom over tech emerges organically from particulars—flake memories warn collapse, throne awaits societal ascent. Final image reweights premise non-literally: empty throne pulses as humanity's foreclosed path. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "when society became wise enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lore-keeper perceptual signature: ancient glyphs vs. artificial moon. Prose texture distinct in futuristic diction ("synth-skin," "chrome horizon") modulating with urgency. Rhythmic control under stress in frantic peeling; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory/prose propulsion; varied rhythm in ascent beats accelerates tension. Minor paraphrase loops ("ruby flake" recurrences purposeful as motif). No artifacts dull closure—final prisms image clear, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sci-fi quest twists to nostalgic wisdom reclamation via paint-peeling temple, irreplaceable in familial glyph reveal. Throne as bridge, not power, transforms trope organically. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
