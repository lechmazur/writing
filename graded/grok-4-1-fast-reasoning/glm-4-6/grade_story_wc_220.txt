<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to reconnect with sister roots consistent traits and compels the decoding choice, embodied in thumb-tracing the leaf. Interiority concrete via visualized vibrations and blue-tinted patterns. Earned shift from body-finding to connection-making lands with felt personal cost in war-loss backstory anchored to present objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cylinder clicks to leaf reveal, culminating in Charged Poise CR where "wild hush suddenly seemed less threatening" reconfigures threat-to-promise with conceptual cost of endured distance. Orientation anchors Elias/settlement early. Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrap-pile mountains and wax leaf constrain decoding tactics, charging final image of moons over jagged silhouette. Sensory hierarchy (tactile grooves, thermal heat) reflects Elias's tuned senses; details evolve causally with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister connection) signals early, tightens via leaf as "key all along" under accumulative lens, narrowing to bridge pursuit with agency in jury-rigging player. Felt cost of loss legible in "breach the gap"; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden connections in decay emerges organically from cylinder-leaf interplay, resonant CR in final hush-reconfiguration without moralizing. Returning amber veins shift from memory to future promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in "frequencies" and "tinted revelations"; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet hush to rising promise. Diction matches wasteland idiom; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (needle "hovering like a diving bird") integrated into action; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of rotating cylinder "empty of secrets but full of promise."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of phonograph/wax encoding transforms post-war tropes into fresh message-retrieval system, riskily layering tech in decay; final bridge riddle feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
