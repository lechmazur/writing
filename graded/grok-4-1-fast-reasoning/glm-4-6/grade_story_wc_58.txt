<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand healing via obits for the living roots consistently in his craft, culminating in an earned endurance of loneliness alongside presence after writing the gardener's piece. Interiority feels concrete through embodied actions like handling the thread and sitting on the bench, revealing contradictory impulses of isolation's splendor versus profound loneliness. Flawless micro-choices under reflective pressure, like weaving the gardener's story, show character-particular projection without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of garden absences and reflective beats builds to Charged Poise closure in the final paragraph's starlit thread and integrated loneliness/presence, with legible conceptual cost of expanded love amid loss. Single continuous scene anchors orientation early (harbor to garden by para 2). One meaningful deepening via writing the obit tightens stakes without slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed autumn garden vividly selective (copper signs, barren roses), mirroring internal states through Elias's goal-directed walk to the bench; recurring thread as micro-setting constrains reflective choice and charges final starlit image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward absences/healing; spatial choreography coherent in twilight progression. Environment subtly guides writing by providing curated losses as material.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding healing's geography) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via garden observations to writing's deepening, narrowing to personal loneliness cost in final lines. Protagonist agency in projecting presence via obit forces stance crystallization with felt price. One decisive intensification sufficient; pressure coheres without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing as loss integration emerges organically from garden signs, gardener's story, and Elias's craft, reweighted non-literally in final "geography of understanding where memories live alongside current realities." Subtext in thread's witness role and starlit close invites ambiguity without confusion; no moralizing, complexity in love's expansion embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices absences/textures idiosyncratically, modulating rhythm from chill seeping to starlit poise. Prose texture purposeful in literary diction/syntax reflecting reflective mind; no elision issues, perceptual bias consistent. Voice elevates without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing reflection/atmosphere; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts, purposeful overwriting integrated (e.g., "geography of healing mapped through careful curation"). Propulsion builds to charged final image; zero scaffold, strong verbs/nouns dominant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obits-for-living premise with explained-absences garden transforms tropes of loss into non-obvious "geography of healing"; thread's reprise feels inevitable. Bold reflective risk heightens stakes via isolation; authentic vision coheres without hedging.</comment>
