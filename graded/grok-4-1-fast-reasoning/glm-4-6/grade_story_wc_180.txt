<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz eye as embodied resilience particularizes interiority; planting micro-choices under doubt earn endurance with felt cost of stained fingers and uncertainty. No contradictory impulses in scene, but persistence reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in seed pulse and imagined laughter; orientation anchored early via ladder ascent; cost legible in "some things...only needed time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard roots/arches constrain kneeling/planting and charge final fluttering ribbon image; sensory details (rustle, dirt) filtered through mender's priorities mirror internal regrowth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mending breach tightens via burying relics to seed's responsive tremble; deepening reweights persistence with sunset cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deciduous vows emerge organically from planting, reweighting contracts in final bridge image without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature via whirring eye; rhythmic modulation builds to quiet hope without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; opening metaphor density ("leafy sea") slightly overwrites early momentum but integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard of promises transforms breach trope into fresh regrowth synthesis; symbolic planting risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
