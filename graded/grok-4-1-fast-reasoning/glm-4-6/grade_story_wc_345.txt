<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No individual characters with interiority, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure; collective "they" motivation summarized without contradictory impulses or visible costs, reducing to stock altruism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density (symbols to discoveries) to CR closure in Gardener's reveal with binding cost; mosaic shards legible but time jumps summarize causality without on-page tightening, diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating arches, nebula patterns, and bells constrain discoveries and charge final image; sensory details (chiming, shimmering) selective and POV-filtered through collective wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore habitability) signaled via atmospheric changes, escalates accumulatively through quests to collective crystallization; cost felt in ghost's isolation but remains abstract without visceral tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust turning strangers to caretakers emerges from particulars (chalk quests, nebula maps) without statement; final image of chalk tradition offers resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent fable-like collective voice with perceptual signature of cosmic wonder; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative cadence, no head-hopping despite omniscient lean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful motif recurrence (chalk, bells) avoids loops, though minor synonym churn in "messages" and "symbols" slightly dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost legend with planetary ecology (bells as atmosphere network) transforms tropes organically; chalk tradition as generational handoff risks distinction.</comment>
