<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of patience vs. urgency act simultaneously in failed frequency attempts leading to breakthrough; final recovery earned by prior micro-choices with felt time cost; traits shown through embodied vibrations and pacifist coaxing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hum to emotional resonance; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure via clasp click as Decisive Change with legible time cost before fireworks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Workshop equipment and oscilloscope constrain tuning choices; stars and candles charge final opening image; sensory hierarchy filters through Silen's silence obsession, evolving with vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking before fireworks signaled early; textural escalation via failed frequencies to shudder tightens pressure, driven by agency with time cost foreclosing silence window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Empathy-through-silences emerges from frequency trials without statement; final firework shattering stillness offers resonant reconfiguration of "moment before understanding" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of silences as "shades and textures"; rhythmic modulation heightens intuition flashes without leakage; voice embodies descriptive mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, vibration; varied rhythm propels to click; minor silence paraphrase loops purposeful for motif, not obscuring climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frequency-unlocking for silence catalog transforms pacifist trope organically; risk in sound-as-empathy synthesis heightens stakes, inevitable from workshop setup to charged firework contrast.</comment>
