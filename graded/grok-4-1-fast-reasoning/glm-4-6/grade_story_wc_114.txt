<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to weigh the swallowed truth drives micro-choices like touching the empty margin and smudging, earning the final endurance of her brother's silence; interiority particularized through fever-weakened body and swaying visions shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as smudges accumulate density, breaking patterns to reveal truth-as-absence; Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly in placing the smudged illustration beside the sextant, reweighting premise with gravitational cost of inherited silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station's thin air and concrete floor ground weak limbs; botanical illustration and sextant recur to constrain choices and charge final image, mirroring internal voids without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find truth's weight signaled early and deepens via smudges that narrow knowledge from stone to absence; agency in repeated marking forecloses denial, with felt cost in passed burden charging ending under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight in absence emerges organically from smudges failing to touch spaces and brother's erased warnings; final image non-literally answers by anchoring flower in messy margins, reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in peripheral flickers and bleeding colors; diction modulates from muddied haze to sharpened contours, reflecting fevered mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short fevered sentences building to expansive realizations; figurative density purposeful in lyric Accumulative mode, taught early via storm-lashed views and paid off in smudge anchors, though minor metaphor pile-up in opening slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological data fractures as oracle visions transforms brother-loss trope; risk in abstract-weight-as-absence realized through concrete charcoal margins heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
