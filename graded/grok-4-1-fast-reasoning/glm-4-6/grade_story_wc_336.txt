<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in the tingling fingers and petrichor scent during essence-pooling; motivation to preserve wonder compels the ritual with resolve. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding serene competence without deeper flaw-driven struggle. Final joy feels earned but untested by opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as essence density builds to the seed's shuddering sprout (RR closure with felt cost of patient longing). Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 1; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of heirloom rarity shapes the final radiant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration—mist/light/river rush supply essence, constraining the ritual and charging the sprouting leaf. Micro-setting (ironwood root depression) anchors pivotal choice. POV bias filters details through pruner's priorities, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive Chroma Blossom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via gathered essence pooling to narrow failure option. Agency in exhaling release forecloses loss with visible cost (tireless ritual effort). Minor abstractness in stakes softens visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. mundane emerges organically from seed's shifting colors reweighting the "steady march" premise. Final leaf as non-literal answer resonates without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in "forgotten" magic. Recurring hush/radiant images charge closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in synesthetic notices (texture/fragrance). Rhythmic modulation builds to exhaling release; no head-hopping. Elevated diction risks register drift from pruner's lexicon in peak but stays voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overwriting dominates—figurative density (hues/scents unnamed) in most sentences of essence-gathering beat muddles propulsion without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops in "radiant hush" repetitions; mixed metaphors (light older than stone) reduce clarity. Strong verbs and sensory propulsion mitigate somewhat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruner-mage weaving essence transforms orchard trope via synesthetic magic rules. Risky lyric hush-tone heightens stakes without gimmickry; final shifting tendril feels inevitable. Non-obvious conceptual integrity in memory-succor commits fully.</comment>
