<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied curse via "every footstep of the city guard, every muttered oath... found purchase in his mind," driving patient gathering; final stance shift to purpose earned without tidy epiphany, though early "richly perceptive" label slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with echo density building to CR closure: "people echo when they refuse to be silenced... resonate against the lie," cost legible in "Spire's lights flickered... cracked silhouette"; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus "serpentine... conducting their collective outrage along its winding paths" constrains pivotal amplification choice, charges final "canyon itself keened"; sensory hierarchy (groans, winds, starlight pulses) POV-specific and evolves causally to tremor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warn of collapse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via woven voices to "ground beneath the Spire shuddered," forcing collective reconfiguration; agency in continued song despite tremor, cost felt in canyon's compromised integrity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from echo particulars, CR offers resonant answer "even the smallest voice... finds a way to resonate against the lie" reweighting intrigue premise without moralizing; final image seashell witness recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sonic bias ("universe humming its secret song through every fissure"); stable close-third POV, rhythmic modulation from melancholy to "chorus of awakening" heightens pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels lyric accum; minor overwrite penalty for figurative stack in peak ("hum... rising in tempo... canyon... keened in protest") but coherent sonic pattern taught early pays off at chorus without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo singer's seashell/canyon acoustics unravel intrigue organically; "gathering threads, sifting... full web" turn inevitable from perceptual curse, risks lyric compression for resonance without gimmick.</comment>
