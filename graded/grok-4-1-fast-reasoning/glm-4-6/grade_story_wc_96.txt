<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's molting personalities create credible endurance, transcending via Maya's friendship without tidy resolution; micro-choices like revealing the coffee tin reveal values under pressure. Final fuller self earned by prior causality. Secondary Maya applies relevant pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting books to network reveal, culminating in CR closure ("Elias felt his transformation beginning... carrying within him all who had dared") with conceptual cost of persistent defiance. Time jumps legible as forward pattern; orientation anchored early ("rusted library under stars"). Lens clear by midpoint, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted library and stars constrain resistance (threat to dismantle) and charge final image ("glowed softly in the pre-morning light"); sensory details like "peeling paint" and moonlight filter through Elias's priorities. Atmosphere tensions control vs. defiance purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge/beauty vs. censorship) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via threat and network reveal, forcing endurance with felt cost in persistence ("Whatever authorities might destroy, they would restore"). Agency in building movement; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of forging beauty/resistance from broken/censored emerges organically via books, seeds, movement; final CR image ("Somewhere, a banned flower was blooming") reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in fluid identity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature ("luminous fracture"); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("beauty from anarchy, right?"), distinct voices. Rhythm modulates from earnest to pragmatic; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor loops ("broken, weathered"; rebuild repetitions) and typos ("like_consts", "on_dirty") create slight churn, but rhythm varies and density high. Prose propels accumulatively without muddled metaphors in peak (threat beat).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet, dual-purpose tin, blooming resistance transforms censorship tropes; personality fluidity risks bold angle heightening stakes via transcendence (+0.3). No close echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
