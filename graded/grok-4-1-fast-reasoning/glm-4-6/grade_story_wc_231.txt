<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hemlock's inherited gift roots motivation in concrete traits, compelling micro-choices like logbook check; embodied emotions (trembling hands, breaking heart) layer contradictions without therapy-speak. Final gesture earns stasis via prior memory pulls. Minor epiphanic summary in borrowed truths slightly abstracts peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: flower triggers memory density to logbook CR, reweighting isolation with conceptual cost in nightly Edelweiss ritual. Orientation anchored early in dock vigil. Persistent memory constraint shapes all tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal dock and lavender mist constrain choices (memory seepage on dock) and charge closure image of nightly flowers left there. Sensory hierarchy (visual pearl tones, tactile petals) biases via Hemlock's perceptual echo-seeking. Evolving case integrates action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode flower) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations narrowing ignorance; logbook merge forces emotional trade-off. Heartbreak cost legible on page alters stance to shared gesture. Single tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed isolation emerges organically from memory particulars, reconfigured in final dock gesture without moralizing. Resonant CR answers love's transcendence amid solitude via Edelweiss reprise. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in ocean echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("whispers," "echoes," "borrowed memories") biases noticing; lyrical syntax modulates rhythmically with intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression pays off in closure image. Voice coheres as eccentric keeper's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (boutonnière to case); varied rhythm propels without monotony. Minor paraphrase loop ("stood where he stood now") and repetitive "softly persistent" motif ding slightly but pattern-taught. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory-absorbing objects transform lighthouse isolation trope into fresh CR of shared witnessing; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via Edelweiss arc. Non-obvious synthesis heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
