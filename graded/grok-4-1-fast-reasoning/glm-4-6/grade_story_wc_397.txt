<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via perceptual seams and pocket anchor; realization earned through textured immersion, though "fold in patience... crease of Understanding" edges into diagnostic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via observation density to CR closure in song beat, where "sound of what continues" reweights premise with untethering cost legible in parasol warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina sensory details (salt/sorrow/melting bergs) constrain salvaging; parasol tip as micro-setting anchors choices and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to discern "hum of collapse" tightens accumulatively through volunteer observations, crystallizing in song with agency of endurance and cost of complete untethering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-continuation emerges via parasol contrast and shanty resilience; final image non-literally answers quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with biased perceptual signature ("world suddenly thinner"); rhythm modulates from terror to poised realization without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels accumulatively, but dense metaphors in "fold in patience... crease of Understanding" slightly muddle peak clarity without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist seeking "sound of endings" via disasters transforms seeker trope into textured epiphany on endurance, risking quiet CR payoff.</comment>
