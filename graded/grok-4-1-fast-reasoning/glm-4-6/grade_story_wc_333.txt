<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in humming persistence against "fear’s defense, a powerful tide," revealing contradictory focus amid chaos; motivation rooted in traits compels climax choice with earned endurance cost. Quiet demeanor shows unassuming boldness without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from star hint to humming thrumming and visualization, yielding RR closure at "soundless snap... wave of pure... joy flooded," with legible decades-built cost in final ordinary hair. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via insight suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus setting constrains via "geometry... slip sideways" and joy flooding out, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (lavender overwhelming, star inner eye) reflects locksmith priorities, integrated into action without stalls. Starlight and workshop evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free Joy) signaled early, escalates texturally through thrum, shimmer, "tide of impossible longing," deepening with 'enough' visualization that forecloses ignorance path; agency in humming forces crystallization with chaos cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance ('enough') emerges organically from hair's transformation and joy flood, reweighting fear without statement; final "another fragment healed" offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in loss's non-diminishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct cosmic-perceptual signature ("thoughts congealed... cosmic dust"); rhythmic modulation from patient hush to thrumming chaos serves pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric figures taught early (e.g., glass harmonica note); minor deduction for "silver在高空" glitch and occasional cosmic synonym churn early, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh mind-locksmith premise synthesizes cosmic metaphor into tactile art with star-hum mechanics; bold lyric risks heighten stakes, transforming fear trope via specific 'enough' insight, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
