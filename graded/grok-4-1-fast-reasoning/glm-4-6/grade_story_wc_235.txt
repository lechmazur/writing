<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in amending jealousy of past selves into freedom, earning the final realization with embodied cost in the smile and soaring. Interiority concrete via breath joining phantom shapes and quill pauses. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of time slips builds to on-page CR closure where confusion reconfigures as blessing, cost legible in "even when you've seen how it ends." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no shards needed. Final shift reweights premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring birch bark scroll constrains writing choice and charges closure image as anchor for slipping timeline. Sensory hierarchy (thin air whispers, cabin creaks, dusk bruises) reflects jaded POV bias. Cabin door groan enables final step-out with tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos) deepens accumulatively via scroll-writing and grave reflection, narrowing to endurance of confusion with felt cost in foreclosed linear hope. Final soaring crystallizes stance under lens. One tightening suffices; agency in quill dips and door opening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of temporal chaos as rebellion emerges implicitly from scroll entries and soaring image reweighting grave knowledge without moralizing. Final line non-literally answers "most foolish way to live?" with resonant ambiguity. Particulars (seventeen-year-old envy) drive earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in temporal parentheses ("yesterday, or was it last decade?") biases noticing, stable close third-person. Rhythmic control modulates from dissonance to "cleaner... altitude" at closure. No elision issues; voice lyrical yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "time had grown slippery" advance texture/character without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short quill hovers, long stream flows); no figurative muddle in peak realization. Propulsion peaks clean in final soaring image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid chronicling + pre-marked grave transforms time-slip trope into blessing via scroll-distilled rebellion. Risky nonlinear voice heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in "beginning again remains... rebellion."</comment>
