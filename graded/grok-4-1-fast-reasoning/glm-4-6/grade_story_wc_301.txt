<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (methodical mapping vs. impulsive release) culminating in the earned tossing of the bellows. Micro-choices under grief pressure reveal values hierarchy. Flawless change at closure with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from graffiti discovery to river edge realization, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when bellows sink, reweighting mapping premise with release cost. Orientation anchored early in station details. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy, rusting rails, and graffiti vividly constrain choices (tracks guide to river) and charge final image (ivy as forgiveness mirror). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (chronicler notices "hieroglyphics"). Environment evolves causally with movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness path) signaled early; tightening via graffiti warnings narrows to north walk despite "bad waters," deepening knowledge at river edge. Agency in release forecloses mapping option with on-page cost. Lens escalation via pattern break in tossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-bridge/walk emerges organically from graffiti, river, bellows; final south walk and smile offer non-literal resonant answer, reweighting prior pursuit without moralizing. Particulars drive complexity, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct chronicler perceptual signature (graffiti as "map references"). Voice texture poetic yet legible, modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences at river roar). No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("daringly methodical," "bathroom graffiti wisdom," "alluded to") creates paraphrase loops across beats, dulling density. Figurative language purposeful but heavy in reflection blocks. Propulsion strong at closure toss; rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief chronicler using graffiti "maps" for emotional quest, transformed by heirloom release into non-capturable insight. Risky symbolic toss feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
