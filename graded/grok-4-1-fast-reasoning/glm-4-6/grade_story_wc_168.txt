<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in shame vs. purpose drives micro-choices like opening the box; embodied scars and memories particularize without therapy-speak dominance; earned change via prior bargain causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density in reflection to RR/CR closure ("something shifted... invitation"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in three-year emotional burden reframed on rock-settling beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Regrowth valley and moonlit path constrain reflective choice and mirror internal shift; recurring celestial dance charges final image without overt symbolism; sensory focus (silver footsteps, warmer box) purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trauma confrontation signaled early, deepens accumulatively to realization tightening; agency in sustained reflection forecloses shame path with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-purpose emerges organically from box/bell particulars; final closing reconfigures bargain without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in "saved too" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scarred perceptual bias (topographic scars, fire precision); rhythmic modulation in celestial phrasing suits reflective texture; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene calm, propelling via image density; minor figurative stack ("ink spilled... silver footsteps") in opening but no closure muddle or loops; high propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bargain-of-innocence premise transforms firefighter trauma trope through specific bell/box; fresh celestial-internal synthesis heightens quiet closure without gimmickry.</comment>
