<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority in oil smell and father's hands memory tying professional to personal stake, with contradictory impulses in vulnerability surge versus methodical cataloging; final armor shift feels earned but epiphany on father's larger role borders unearned leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via flickering light and grime-surfaced inscription tightening to personal truth; closure as Charged Poise in genuine smile and step out reconfigures past with felt memory cost, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel's curved walls and damp grime narrow perception selectively through detective bias, with lantern constraining sight and charging final "light of a new day" image to mirror internal liberation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming story from lies emerges organically through lantern-guided fragments shifting to stepping stones; final image non-literally answers control via freedom promise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "lantern’s light" stems and paraphrase loops (flicker/waver/steady) create template cadence across descriptive beats, dulling propulsion; overwriting in shadow "puppets" muddles clarity without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lantern in modern subway quest transforms investigator trope via entangled father parallel, with inscription turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
