<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied passion blending precision and fervor during creation; traits like scientific rigor compel the alchemical choices with felt cost in poured resolve. Kael's whisper initiates but lacks crucible pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from whisper to star creation; CR closure lands with conceptual cost in revalued memory, pocket-sun dimming as visible price. Orientation anchored early at nexus. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via temporal elasticity and energy hum, charging final star image; columella and pocket-sun as micro-settings enable choices. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemical priorities). Vivid yet selective, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture presence tightens via alchemical deepening under Accumulative lens, foreclosing passive observation with resolve cost in final flare. Agency in weaving rays. No reversal needed; one intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory transformation emerges organically via spiral evolution and light synthesis; final star reweights "returning differently" without moralizing. Resonant CR answers density question through charged image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in alchemical metaphors; voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful (e.g., "density of presence"). Whisper dialogue natural, subtext-laden. Minor elevated register but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in climax. Minor light-imagery loops but pattern-taught. No scaffold in creation beat; propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric alchemy transforms memory trope via specific tools and process; risk in conceptual CR heightens stakes. Inevitable in hindsight from whisper to star.</comment>
