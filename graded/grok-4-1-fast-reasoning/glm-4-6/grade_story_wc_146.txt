<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete but thin, with tuner as enigmatic archetype rather than flawed individual shown through micro-choices. No safety-hedging but minimal internal conflict or emotional layering under pressure. Actions align with motives, earning quiet endurance at close.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern taught early (tuning fork vibration spreads); closure as Charged Poise in final image ("town was alive again... a new town was born") reconfigures dissonance to harmony with conceptual cost of past wounds stitched. Orientation anchored by paragraph 2; one tightening at clock tower. Persistent constraint of sound/rhythm shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid and selective (cobblestones "glowed... warmth seeping," sigils "hummed"), filtered through tuner's notice of resonances; recurring cobblestones/archway constrain entry/revival and charge final image. Atmosphere tensions wild hush perfectly; spatial choreography coherent across walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town revival) signaled early, escalates via textural density (echoes stir, laughter echoes, square pulses) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to harmonious reconfiguration; agency in steps/strikes forecloses dissonance with felt cost in town's "collective heartbeat." Climax at tower tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance restored emerges organically from sound-weaving events, not statement; final image ("footsteps remained... etched into the cobblestones") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise with lingering ambiguity of "wild hush." No moralizing; complexity in revival's quiet joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (notices vibrations, memories in stone); rhythmic prose texture mirrors theme, modulating from patient grace to pulsing revival without head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression legible under lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short declarative pulses in revival beats); high density integrates image/action, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("dusk bled... drinking the last light") across build without obscuring; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image. Minor repetition of "cobblestones" patterned for payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-revival transforms ghost town trope organically through tuner's footfall-rhythm; non-obvious premise ("vibration that seemed to travel backward through years") inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightening resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
