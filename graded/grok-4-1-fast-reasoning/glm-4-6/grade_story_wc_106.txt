<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction peaks in frustration at silence ("void so profound it made his chest ache") driving reinterpretation choice; arc earned with cost of unfulfilled theft but borders tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via light density buildup to silence pattern-break then smile CR; mirror realization reconfigures premise on-page with dull jar and lighter heart as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jar constrains tool use and charges dull reprise in final image; emerald/golden light evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence after moonbeam spill texturally deepens dominant stake of destiny-listening, forcing endurance via tracing to renunciation with frustration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>CR final image ("found only himself") non-literally reweights self-as-destiny theme through light motif shift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("shadow painted in honey") biases toward luminous details, stable single-POV with rhythm modulating to dimming cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density in peak beat ("chest ache with luminous disbelief"; poured 星光) overwhelms without pattern payoff; redundant light/golden phrasing loops in realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moonbeam jar and flower-code mechanics transform portrait-thief trope into inevitable introspective CR, risking poetic fantasy payoff.</comment>
