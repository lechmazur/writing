<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's embodied interiority peaks in "pressed a finger to his map, and a new line appeared," earning change from contradictory impulses of tracing others' paths versus drawing his own, with cost of blurred time legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as chip-ant-cavern-map density tightens to CR closure; cost undeniable in "paths he’d let blur with time" reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent cavern walls and ivy curtain constrain crevice entry and charge map-room image, filtering through Elias's empirical notice of purposeful lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Loneliness stake signaled in "weight of their silence" deepens via agency in following ants and pressing chip; cost felt in foreclosed avoidance at new-line draw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of own-path maps emerges implicitly, answered non-literally by pen pickup reweighting prior tracing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature in selective noticing of chip warmth and ant purpose modulates rhythm through discovery pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel cavern sequence cleanly; no loops, purposeful figures like "creek’s roar softened" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Matrix chip + ants + choice-maps synthesis transforms map-trope into fresh doorway premise, risks surreal payoff heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
