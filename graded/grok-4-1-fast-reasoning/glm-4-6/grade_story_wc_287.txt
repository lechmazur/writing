<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in wistful pragmatism drives precise actions like using the bitting gauge for adjustments, with protected vulnerability shown through solitary persistence. Interiority concrete in embodied observation of harbor and petals, but occasional label-speak like "deeply sensitive nature" slightly abstracts emotional contradiction. Final communal adoption earns a credible endurance with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tool collection to installation at 2:17 AM, culminating in CR closure where neighbors' mirrors reconfigure solitary effort into communal light with conceptual cost of shared vulnerability. Orientation anchored early in fire escape and harbor; one tightening via dawn results visible in alley glow. No causality breaks; pattern of persistence pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous harbor by moonlight supplies essential light source constraining mirror angles, charging final spring image of seedlings amid continued reflections. Sensory details like "rusty metal staircase" and "oars in water" integrate tactilely into actions; POV bias favors pragmatic notice of waves and petals. Minor generic phrasing in alleys, but spatial choreography clear across night-to-spring evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reflect light into dark corners signaled early, escalates accumulatively via precise alignments and winter maintenance to communal adoption, narrowing solitary options with endurance cost. Agency in weekly adjustments forces trade-off of vulnerability; one deepening at dawn alley glow charges image. Stakes viscerally felt in spiritual darkness threat, but external pressure mild without antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of small lights transforming winter darkness emerges organically from mirror network and petal-drop motif shifting to neighbor mirrors, offering non-literal resonance in final image without moralizing. Subtext in protected vulnerability layers complexity, inviting reflection on communal change from persistence. Earned insight avoids platitudes via concrete alley glow and superintendent's addition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in wistful, rhythmic observations like "fishing boats bobbed like corks." Lyrical diction modulates with intensity, compressing elegantly during 2:17 AM alignment; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture particular through harbor-biased syntax, consistent without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like bitting gauge enabling "microscopic adjustments"; rhythm varies for propulsion, ear-test clean. Minor paraphrase loops in "final petal drops" and "rhythm of oars" repetitions (−0.3), but no closure muddle; strong verbs dominate without nominalizations. Slight overwriting in "quivering hush" metaphor, but purposeful for hush atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lockmaster's bitting gauge as precision tool transforms mundane gardener trope into fresh light-engineering premise. Risky lyric accumulation from night work to seasonal arc heightens communal stakes organically. Final neighbor mirrors feel inevitable hindsight reconfiguration, avoiding template plots through specific harbor/mirror logic.</comment>
