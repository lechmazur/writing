<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation rooted in consistent traits (monochrome painter seeking imperfection's beauty) intensifies compellingly to barter and awakening; interiority concrete via gray perceptions and plant micro-choices. Minor shortfall in simultaneous contradictory impulses—defiance and regret via plants implied but not acted concurrently—though final gasp embodies earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant arrangement accumulates to barter (lily seals), ellipsis to awakening (reed vibrates unlocking chamber). On-page RR closure in color fracture with prior gray cost legible ("field of nothing"); orientation anchored by ~50 words in courtyard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard glass and plants constrain barter (workbench proximity, reed on velvet); POV-filtered gray shimmers evolve to post-awakening ruby/emerald charge in final image. Sensory hierarchy (light values pre-, spectrum post-) mirrors stakes; no white-room, spatial choreography clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color awakening) signaled early, tightens via Lyra's gestures narrowing to lily trade-off, foreclosing gray world. Agency in cunning arrangements and reed use drives escalation under accumulative lens; cost felt in stumble and magnified flaws.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's beauty emerges organically via gray plants to vibrant flaws; final image ("glorious, messy, vibrant flaws") reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in symbolic lily/barter avoids moralizing; resonance from particulars like reed hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (monochrome to "amber and sienna"); rhythmic prose modulates from measured arrangements to gasped revelation. Gestural dialogue (Lyra's points) subtextual; no head-hopping, distance tightens at awakening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax in awakening beat ("gray world fractured... bloomed into a spectrum"); minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("kaleidoscope... tapestry") slightly dulls early momentum but purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind painter barters reed tongue via plants post-phoenix transforms tropes organically; risk in symbolic communication heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in vibrant flaws image.</comment>
