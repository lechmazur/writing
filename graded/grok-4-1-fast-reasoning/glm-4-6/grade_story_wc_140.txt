<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim erased self via fragments drives all micro-choices, culminating in earned pocket of label as identity key; interiority concrete in perceiving "clang... tremor of a story," though occasional abstract labels like "narrative transmutation" mildly dilute embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments density-build to label discovery/layering; CR closure in reflection collage reconfigures nameless void with legible conceptual cost ("armor against the nameless void"); orientation anchored early in port labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain discovery/movement and charge final image ("walked deeper into the labyrinth"); tides selectively heighten sensory hierarchy (low tide for listening), mirroring internal mosaic without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture memories) signaled early, deepens decisively at label layering narrowing options to forged identity; agency in collecting/endurance shows coherent pressure under Accumulative lens, cost felt in persistent void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from fragments-into-label transmutation; final reflection ("collage of all the faces") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clang... not noise, but tremor") biases noticing toward mosaic fragments; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, POV stable/single without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose propulsion ("sun slanting... like a searchlight"); figurative layering purposeful under textural lens, minor elevated diction ("epicenter") in peak doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghost + fragment cartographer transforms identity trope; layering action risks poetic density but heightens stakes in closure reconfiguration.</comment>
