<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The caster's guilt-rooted drive and embodied tremble in "technically gentle fingers trembled as he lifted it" propel micro-choices to the unflinching climax, earning the final self-forgiveness with clear internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density buildup to on-page RR closure in "the last remnants of his guilt dissolve like frost in spring," with legible emotional cost in the thawing pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound cold brittles the rope, constraining reconfiguration, while aurora walls receive the projecting pattern, charging the voices' emergence and final glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve names deepens accumulatively as light blooms into voices "spill[ing] from the aurora itself," forcing stance crystallization with agency in the final tug and guilt's felt thaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's auditory preservation over bronze statues emerges organically, answered resonantly in the sanctum whispering "his own" name without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with artisan perceptual bias in fiber "humming" and perforation alignments; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence and density, but templated repetition of "technically gentle hands/fingers" three times and contrived "snowmelt ardor" twice create artifact drag without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of wax-casting, punched card, and ancestral rope transforms memory trope into fresh light/sound conduit, risking lyric magic that heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
