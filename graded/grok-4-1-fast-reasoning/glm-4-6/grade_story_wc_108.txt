<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation from betrayal and phobia drives micro-choices like tracing notes despite terror, with embodied tremors showing contradiction; final rebuild earned by adaptive persistence. Minor weakness in stock epiphanies like "vulnerability is power" feeling diagnostic without full embodied cost in climax confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of whispers/notes building to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early (library, phobia, seashell). Confrontation summary softens causality slightly but cost legible in final wholeness image; one tightening via decryption suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (decay/ozone, groaning shelves) filter through phobia bias, constraining choices in enclosed space; stars as recurring witness charge final image. Lab shift coherent; micro-objects (seashell, cast) evolve tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity vs phobia/betrayal) signaled early, tightens via decryption to confrontation under Accumulative lens; agency in outwitting forecloses fear path with felt cost. Climax confession lacks full reversal depth, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges organically from notes/scoff to wielded weapon, resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in seashell taunts/whispers; minor directness in notes declaration dilutes ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (stars as salt/witness); rhythm modulates tension poetically. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re too late"); no head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High density but figurative overload (skeletons/stars salt) in pressure beats risks muddle; minor paraphrase loops (trembling/resolve repeats). Propulsion strong overall, rhythm varies; no major artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of stunt double/phobia/seashell betrayal transforms identity tropes via adaptive decryption; final reweighting inevitable. Bold poetic risks heighten without gimmick.</comment>
