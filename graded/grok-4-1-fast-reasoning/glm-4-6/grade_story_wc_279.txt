<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in artistic traits drives choices, with socially perceptive nature enabling flake discovery; embodied emotions via trembling fingers and lilac-tinged breath add texture, but epiphany at "she understood" feels slightly unearned without deeper contradictory impulses acting in the mandala scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building from chalk to sand mandala tightening density; on-page CR closure via mandala glow and realization reconfigures unlearning's meaning with conceptual cost of merged consciousness; orientation anchored early in grotto during unlearning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Misty grotto and tile flake constrain choices by supplying tools and energy for mandala; sensory hush absorbs whispers, mirroring internal unease and charging final glow; selective details like breathing walls and damp stone integrate via goal-directed action without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding hush escalates texturally via flake's vibration rearranging sand patterns, narrowing to interjection with agency in palm press; cost felt in hush's living shift and consciousness merge, cohering pressure to Charged Poise CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as space-making emerges organically from particulars like sand spirals and returning whispers; final mandala image offers resonant CR without overt moral, but closing sentence borders thematic echo by articulating thesis too directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature of color-shifting whimsy fitting artist; rhythmic modulation builds from misty tracing to humming muting; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure glow without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure mandala beat with lilac/violet churn and mixed textures ("blanket with the texture of lilac and anxiety"); minor paraphrase loops on unease and patterns dull propulsion, but rhythm varies and anchors voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unlearning hush, chalk/sand art, and tile flake interjection transforms abstract forgetting into tactile discovery; risk in textural CR closure via mandala feels inevitable from early patterns, heightening conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
