<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like tracing tooth ridges and weaving melodies, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal healing beats; "luminous ache" embodies bittersweet joy effectively yet borders on diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from woman to child spirit to final pause; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page when tooth is pressed into earth, reconfiguring purpose with legible weight/cost in "heart carried the laughter"; orientation anchored early in gorge and sunrise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gorge's acoustics and sunrise constrain method and charge closure, mirroring distortion to harmony; crocodile tooth as micro-setting tethers choices and pulses as primal reminder in final kneel, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul-healing via laughter signaled early, escalates accumulatively through two spirits' deepening pattern with agency in tune adjustments; cost felt in "chest tightened" and "weight settling," charging final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from laughter-threads in gray tapestry; final symphony of release offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting sorrow/joy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature in sound/filtered light; rhythmic modulation under pressure purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops like repeated "distorted notes"/"misaligned harp" and "pursued"/"next" in final third dull propulsion; figurative density overwrites peak beats without full pattern payoff, but rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting via tooth-tuned echoes for laughter-healing transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
