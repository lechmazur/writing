<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's shift from debunker to truth excavator earned via on-page reassembly under observation pressure; contradictory impulses in disbelief of curses vs. pattern-seeking shown in pavilion entry and letter piecing. Final report choice forecloses debunking path with conceptual cost. Blind spot in rationalism yields to imperfection embrace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build to CR closure where "diamond's flaw was what made it perfect" reweights premise with cost of worldview reconfiguration. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; "shredded letters hidden beneath floorboards" tightens via causal reconstruction. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final orchard walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/wasteland constrains via mask and clean-air surprise in pavilion, charging final image of "standing amid trees that shouldn't live." Recurrent diamond facets mirror internal patterns; sensory hierarchy (dust winds to neutral air) reflects POV urgency. Spatial choreography coherent from gates to cabin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debunk anomaly) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via letters revealing "quantum resonance," forcing report renunciation with conceptual cost. One tightening in overnight reassembly narrows debunk/excavate options; agency in manual piecing drives escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-balance emerges via orchard thriving and diamond crack, resonant CR in "flaw... allowing a flow of transformation" reweighting destruction/perfection binary without moralizing. Particulars (isotope transformation, executive lies) yield earned insight; final image non-literal answer to anomaly question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with observant perceptual signature biasing toward ink patterns and facets; diction/rhythm modulate from descriptive entry to compressed night work. No head-hopping; inference calibrated to discoveries. Prose texture distinct in selective sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in reconstruction ("patterns of ink, water marks, grain"); varied rhythm propels to morning light without loops or scaffolds. Minor repetition of "sharply observant" purposeful; no figurative muddle, strong verbs anchor propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Radioactive orchard with isotope-transforming diamond fresh synthesis of conspiracy/sci-fi; transforms curse trope via quantum properties grounded in letters. CR risk on imperfection theme heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates.</comment>
