<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaelen's mild obsession, tempered by respect versus predecessor's madness, drives consistent micro-choices like whispering and accelerating work, earning the final welcoming shift with embodied tension in fingers on embrasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as star deaths build density to CR closure—"endless night was not empty at all, but full"—with conceptual cost in reconfiguring loss as gateway, legible in glowing booklet's final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed fort and chamber's hush constrain focus amid wind; booklet as recurring micro-setting charges closure glow without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping endless night tightens accumulatively as stars dwindle to one, forcing accelerated work and reweighting via pattern discovery; cost felt in urgency at final flicker.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of absence's architecture emerges organically from silence-summarizing and pebble secrets; final image offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration of darkness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature biased toward hush and gaps; poetic diction and rhythm modulate intensity consistently, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive exact phrases ("flaking gold leaf booklet" x4, "endless night" loops) and paraphrase churn on obsession create patterned artifacts dulling propulsion; dense metaphors verge on muddle in peak beats without crisp payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms cosmic diminishment into silence-cartography revealing darkness's interior; risk in lyrical hush-pattern heightens stakes organically.</comment>
