<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent spiritual curiosity drives her isolation and rituals, earning the final realization through accumulative practice, but interiority leans abstract ("flourishing stillness") without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from discovery through deepening rituals to Charged Poise closure in the dome's clarity moment ("she was both the observer and the observed"), with felt conceptual cost in transformed perception; orientation anchors early; one tightening via ritual intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station, dome, and lantern glass constrain rituals and charge the final image (glass "now contained...yet somehow remained empty"); selective cosmic sensory details (chimes, hum, warmth) filter through her curiosity without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding connection in isolation tightens accumulatively through ritual deepening to clarity under Textural lens, with agency in empathic practice foreclosing resistance; cost legible in acceptance of "transient pain"; one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically from rituals to resonant final image (Elara's essence flowing, glass ready for next), reweighting isolation without moralizing; earned through particulars, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical single POV stable with cosmic perceptual signature (stars as conscious, glass resonating); rhythmic modulation fits meditative pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs (short clarity beat vs. flowing summaries); high density integrates setting/action; minor reflective paraphrase ("profound strength in vulnerability") nudges down but no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise synthesizes spiritual quest with stellar empathy via glass in fresh, inevitable arc; risk-taking in textural time-compression heightens meditative stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
