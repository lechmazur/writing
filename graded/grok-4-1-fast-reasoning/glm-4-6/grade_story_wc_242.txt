<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied disc-tracing and dawning realization of self-in-loop during calls; motivation to guide callers earned through prior operator echo. Minor lack of on-page micro-choices under live pressure slightly limits contradictory impulses to scene actions, but endurance at closure feels scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of loop layers to CR closure in final lines ("for himself, whenever he chose to make his final call"), reweighting estrangement with conceptual cost of perpetual distance. Orientation anchored early in tunnel/booth; single reflective scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel acoustics preserve conversations, constraining Archie's work and charging final image of layered sounds; selective sensory details (rust/ozone, drips, streetlamp hum) mirror internal loop via disc vibrations. Micro-setting of booth/disc guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding endings accumulates via disc revelations, tightening in self-loop realization that forecloses escape with endurance cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise; one deepening suffices but lacks visceral live-option trade-off in pivotal call moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wrong connections birthing beginnings emerges organically from disc/calls, resonant CR in final image reweighting estrangement as "connection at the right distance" without moralizing. Particulars like 3:47 call length avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in tunnel sounds/disc tones modulates rhythmically; stable third-limited POV biases toward harmonic gaps. Compression of loop taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (loop/disc) advancing texture; rhythm varies with sentence length for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops on "wrong number" (e.g., repeated phrasing mid-story) dull one beat but spare closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms Cold War booth into melodically haunted loop architecture organically; fresh synthesis of wrong-number therapy via disc feels inevitable in hindsight, risking quiet CR payoff without gimmick.</comment>
