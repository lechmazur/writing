<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of repeated runs building to Charged Poise closure in bell's resonant silence and forged bonds; one tightening via youths volunteering narrows generational divide with felt scarcity cost; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
