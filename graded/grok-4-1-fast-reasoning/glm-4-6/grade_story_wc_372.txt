<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve vows clear and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; success via endurance feels competent yet unpressured by internal flaws or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with fading vows building density to Charged Poise closure in slide's preservation; cost legible in "vows themselves would eventually disappear" yet meanings endure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen library's cold and crystalline hush constrain precise hands/movements and mirror impermanence, charging final chamber image; sensory hierarchy sharpens under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing vows escalates accumulatively via dimming luminosities and final two vows forcing sensitivity increase; exhaustion cost felt, agency in persistent measurement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of promise-to-memory cycle emerges via measuring acts and pulsing responses, with final image non-literally reweighting "fleeting and eternal" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with meticulous perceptual signature; rhythmic texture modulates hush to pulsing urgency, sustaining voice coherence to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion, but minor loops in "quartz hush"/"frozen library" phrasing slightly drag without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh frequency-sampling of transcendent vows transforms preservation trope organically, with conceptual integrity risking lyric poise for inevitable CR closure.</comment>
