<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inspector's hesitation and pocketing of the pearl reveal contradictory impulses between professional caution and buried longing for connection, earning the final shift to carrying seashells with visible vulnerability cost. Interiority particular through seashell patterns and dreams; embodied emotion in pulsing radiance syncing with cave's breath. Minor epiphany summary in coda slightly abstracts peak change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pearl discovery to dreams/method reveal to communal glow, landing Charged Poise closure in pearl's display reconfiguring isolation with emotional exposure cost. Orientation anchored early in caves; one tightening via dreams' ellipsis motivated by latent work. Three-week jump legible under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain inciting choice (pearl nested in quartz) and charge final image (caves pulsing with hearts); sensory hierarchy (rainbows, breath-pulse) reflects inspector's shift from cataloging to wonder. Seashells as micro-setting enable climax. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) signaled in buried dreams, tightens accumulatively via pearl's hope-acquisition forcing communal risk; agency in pressing shells forecloses emotional fortresses with tears/hands-reaching cost legible in glow-ceiling formation. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of emotional bunkers emerges organically from pearl/shell confessions and light-ceiling, offering non-literal resonant answer in final pearl-as-mirror image reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in vulnerability whispers; complexity in sustained ambiguity of ongoing whispers avoids tidy morals. Coda edges toward explicitness, softening peak resonance.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with crystalline perceptual signature (swirling opalescence, spirals); rhythm modulates from cautious catalog to resonant hush, heightening pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; diction controlled, eliding via dreams taught early and paid in gathering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pearl's pulse embodies emotion/foreshadows); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion fits accumulative builds. Minor overwriting in radiance/heart repetitions and figurative density in gathering beat dulls one peak slightly; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl/seashell confessions transform bunker isolation trope into fresh emotional circuitry synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via cave discoveries. Bold lyric risk in accumulative glow-choreography heightens stakes; conceptual integrity commits to radiance rules without retreat.</comment>
