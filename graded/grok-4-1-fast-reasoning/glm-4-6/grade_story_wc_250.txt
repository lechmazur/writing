<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation clear and consistent in actions like mirror use and shutter adjustments, embodying silent empathy; Anna's grief credible via unsent letters. Interiority poetic but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning archetypal. Final realization earned through patterns without deep internal conflict shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from preparations to Anna's viewing; closure as Charged Poise in her tears and perception of father's messages, cost felt in grief reconfiguration. Single scene anchored early at dock. One tightening via her approach and viewing spot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain vividly constrains angles and reflections, charging final star-water image; puddles and shutters integrate via goal-directed action. Sensory hierarchy favors light/shadow per guardian's bias. Micro-setting of viewing point guides choice and mirrors internal states subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Anna's grief tightens accumulatively via pattern density to realization; guardian's agency in weaving forecloses her isolation with emotional cost in tears. One deepening at viewing spot narrows to personal insight. Pressure coherent without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wordless healing emerges via light patterns resolving grief; final shutter shift offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence as luminous truth. Subtext in implications avoids moralizing. Particulars like unsent letters ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in light/reflections; lyrical voice modulates calmly, distinct texture in syntax/rhythm. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-heavy ("They say you can help people see"). No head-hopping, consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with poetic propulsion, high density in integrated images; minor overwriting in metaphors ("time itself bent") purposeful but borders density issue in setup. No loops or scaffolds dulling closure; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shutters/mirror for grief patterns transforms mystic trope via specific optics; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration of ongoing vigil inevitable from premise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
