<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like hand patterns coaxing order, reveal contradictory furious tranquility driving the sync with great-grandmother. Final mastery of inheritance feels earned via prior frantic lineage struggle. Minor label-speak in "furiously tranquil" slightly abstracts peak embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from ice lattices to geometric patterns and inward seam, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (inheritance from curse to command) with conceptual cost in rewritten duty felt in final bone-hum. Orientation anchored early in atrium post-egg. Closure image of fused cap recharges prior stake indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and oak cap constrain choices (precise depression fit, pliant floor) and charge closure (seamless fusion), with sensory shifts from cracking cold to soil warmth mirroring entropy decrease. Starlight filters evolve from distant to affirming. Body/setting integration tactile and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to master vortex via reopening escalates accumulatively through alignment pulse narrowing frantic options, with agency in whispering equilibrium forcing sync trade-off. Cost legible in "frantic energy gone, replaced by deep serenity." Protagonist endurance forecloses curse path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entropy decrease vs chaos emerges organically from ice rearrangement and inheritance recalibration, reweighting frantic archive to balanced keepership. Final starlit peace offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, complicating curse with serene command.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature biased to time's "grain and weave," modulating rhythm from furious to wild serenity. Elevated diction fits heirloom saver's lost-language voice, propelling via syntactic density. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (ice as "tiny verse in the poem of reduction") propels without loops, though minor recurrence of "serenity" variants borders template cadence pre-closure. Rhythm varies for ear, varying sentence lengths breathe with stasis hum. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving trope with temporal entropy mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming inheritance curse via non-obvious decrease method. Bold sci-fantasy commitment heightens stakes without gimmick, risking abstract physics paid off in tactile resonance.</comment>
