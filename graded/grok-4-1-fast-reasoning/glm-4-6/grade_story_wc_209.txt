<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation rooted in obsession with night blooms compels seasonal progression of micro-choices like postcard arrangement and pavilion visit; contradictory drive softens into earned stasis with felt contentment cost at "quiet drive... had softened into contentment."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via seasonal density build to CR closure; pattern taught early in studio-to-pavilion shards with legible transitions; cost legible in final image of wrapped mural reweighting her premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's etched glass constrains revelation choice and charges final mural image; sensory details like "snow trickled down the windowpane" selectively mirror nocturnal focus without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode night blooms tightens accumulatively through pavilion deepening, narrowing options from fixation to reconfiguration; agency in patient observation forecloses obsessive path with contentment cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of darkness revelations emerges organically from postcards-to-etchings progression; final image of breathing painted flowers offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting blooms as "heart of the garden."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in floral imagery; rhythmic prose modulates from driven to tender, as in "petals catching the moon's glow"; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm integrates metaphors like "umbral tenderness" purposefully in lyric mode; no loops or scaffolds, though minor figurative density in revelation beat nudges below 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist's quest via postcards and etchings transforms nocturnal bloom trope; risk-taking seasonal mosaic heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
