<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, intensifying via arrow tip jolt to core tree discovery; interior suspicion of echoes feels particular. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—Kael remains unflappably competent without embodied stress degrading thought. Final lesson earned but lacks visible cost foreclosing a path on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/conceptual density of echoes and inverted world builds to CR closure ("orchard’s resilience wasn’t innate—it was learned") with vulnerability cost legible in final glowing arrow and lingering silence. Orientation anchored early (Kael, Xylos inversion). Single scene coherent; no shard/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration—sweet decay air, pulsing roots—mirrors internal states and constrains choices (slow anchoring to preserve equilibrium, water flow navigation). Floating arches/recurring boulder charge final ascent image. POV bias shapes professional noticing (sensors, currents); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early, tightens via arrow extraction surge/echoes deafening toward core tree deepening under accumulative lens. Agency in descent/extraction; cost felt in jolt and exposed vulnerability charging poise. One meaningful cadence shift suffices; no reversals required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of learned resilience emerges organically from arrow wound/tree scars, reweighted in CR ending without statement ("wound and turned it into strength"). Returning echoes/whirling silence motif charges closure image non-literally. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity in wielding wisdom lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: pilot's textured noticing (hull vibrations, water spines). Voice modulates rhythmically—short sensor beeps amid lyric inversions—consistent diction suits sci-fi idiom. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm supports propulsion; motifs like "whirling silence" purposeful without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors ("quiet chaos, faint vibrations") dulls one high-pressure beat (echoes deafening), but no scaffold/touch closure. Clean syntax, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-inverted orchard with living echoes transforms tropes via arrow catalyst/resilience pact. Risky lyric sci-fi frame feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative templates. Bold inversion physics heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
