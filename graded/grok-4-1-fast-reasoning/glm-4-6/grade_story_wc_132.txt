<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the pity vs. clinical detachment during the first storm ("felt a pang of something like pity, a frustrating, illogical emotion"), compelling the climactic surrender with embodied cost. Final choice to participate earns change through prior failed analysis. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the desperate second-storm beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation patterns build to pattern break in dropping the tablet and stepping into rain, yielding CR closure where Elias reconfigures as participant, cost legible in "root him in the saturated soil of the moment." Orientation anchors by para 2 (nursery, leaf on trellis). One tightening suffices via failed shield chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf as micro-setting constrain focus and charge final image ("still there, glistening with a new light"). Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet earth, rain piercing skin) reflects Elias's shift, embodied in climax ("felt the individual drops pierce his skin"). Weather drives choices without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify leaf's resilience) signaled early tightens accumulatively via chaotic thrashing defying model, failed shield, to participatory release with cost in abandoning control ("his own rigid framework begin to splinter"). Agency crystallizes stance; price felt in physical/emotional surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from leaf's endurance and Elias's arc, answered non-literally in post-storm image ("He was the man and the leaf... swaying together") reweighting observation-to-participation without moralizing. Complexity lingers in "resisted yet required to survive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("decode the silent eloquence of their growth"; plant-as-language bias). Rhythmic control modulates from precise ("neat rows of numbers") to lyric under stress ("spread down the imaginary stem"), no leakage. Voice texture distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels: vivid rhythm varies (short storm sentences accelerate), no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("sky bruised purple") doesn't touch closure; figurative coherence holds in leaf semaphore to sustaining transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms epiphany trope via quantifiable plant study to embodied metamorphosis, inevitable in hindsight from "Reluctant Metamorphosis" setup. Fresh synthesis of science-poetry tension risks bold lyric closure without gimmick.</comment>
