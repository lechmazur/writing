<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied age and aloofness in micro-choices like painting the shell alone, but interior epiphanies border on diagnostic labels ("intimately aloof") without fully contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final release feels earned yet lacks raw irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure in shell's bleeding colors ("the colors bleeding into the pool like ink"); cost legible in release moment, one tightening via cave discovery; orientation anchored early on quay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss and tide pools vividly constrain release choice and charge final mirror image; sensory hierarchy painter-specific (light, colors); cave evolves causally from damp earth to glowing jewel pools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbreakable promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to shell drop narrowing preserve/let-go options; agency in deliberate lowering carries felt emotional cost; no major slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" emerges organically via shell-to-pool image reweighting preservation premise without moralizing; resonant final quay/mirror callback offers non-literal answer; minor directness in "promises aren’t about keeping" tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (sunset spirals, fractured light) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged brevity at drop; purposeful compression taught early, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("smiled" reprise, "painted seashell" churn) and lyric overwriting slightly dull mid-reflection beats; closure image clean, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painterly gaze on letting-go trope via cave-oasis pivot and bleeding shell; risks quiet lyric closure effectively; familiar epiphany arc limits to strong, not exceptional ingenuity.</comment>
