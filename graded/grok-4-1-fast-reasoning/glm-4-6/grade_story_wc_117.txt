<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's characterization shines through embodied actions like touching the locket and adaptive playing, with cautious exuberance as a consistent trait driving micro-choices; Leo's breakthrough feels earned via subtle responses culminating in his whisper. Minor therapy-speak ("music joined with nature to create spaces for emotional reconnection") abstracts emotion slightly, but doesn't undermine pivotal connection moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as eclipse density builds to Charged Poise closure in shared curls under the diamond ring, with felt vulnerability cost legible ("placing it beside Maya's curl"); single scene oriented early (Maya at Sage Ridge with Leo). One micro-turn at totality suffices; weeks-later reflection anchors cleanly without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge's oak roots and changing eclipse light constrain choices (harnessing totality) and charge final image; sensory details (harp tones matching light, twilight hush) filtered through Maya's priorities integrate purposefully. Roots motif mirrors internal states evolutionarily without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching withdrawn Leo via music/nature) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through eclipse phases to deepening at hand-link and curl-share, narrowing isolation with relational cost. Leo's agency in approaching and whispering forces reconfiguration; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically from particulars like curls and eclipse bridge, resonating in final image without direct statement until late; subtext in tentative gestures invites ambiguity on healing. Closing reflection ("not to fix what was broken, but to help others recognize the magic") borders thematic echo, slightly tidying complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (music/nature bias) modulates rhythmically; Leo's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Can you link the music to the stars?") advances plot. Lyrical diction purposeful for tone, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory density, but overwriting in metaphors ("dreaming roots spread like unseen rivers," repeated "cautious exuberance") creates minor coherence drag in opening; no loops touch closure. High-pressure totality beat clear and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy, eclipse spectacle, and dual baby curls transforms healing trope into vulnerable connection; curls' irreplaceable reprise at peak feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
