<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's diligence roots his obsession and compels the pivotal choice to sing to the dust, earning change with embodied tension ("heart pounded"). Interiority concrete via tracing notes amid shifting lyrics. Minor abstraction in poetic impulses slightly dilutes contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from radio lyrics to crystal discovery to dust awakening as Resonant Reconfiguration; closure cost legible in "crystal dimmed... dial glow faded," reweighting stakes. Orientation anchored early in hall and famine. One tightening via coalesced instruction suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust as recurring micro-setting constrains climax choice (needs song) and charges final image of whispering chorus. Sensory hierarchy (hum, glow, mist curl) selective via Elias's preservation bias. Atmosphere tensions mist/thin with renewal, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end famine via dust stories) signaled early, texturally deepens through lyric instruction to crystal activation; agency in singing narrows options with visible cost (crystal dims). Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gentle renewal emerges from dust-to-chorus arc, final image ("dust now a chorus") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting preservation without moralizing. Subtext in shifting lyrics invites ambiguity on memory's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature (tales in dust, mist as cloak) biased and rhythmic. Compression taught early via fragments, paid in humming crescendo; diction modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with motifs (glow, dust) propelling accumulatively; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in climax metaphors ("velvet" dust, "dancing shadows") densifies without muddle, but slight repetition of "glow" borders template.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesizes famine, pirate lyrics, dust animation into inevitable lyric payoff; risk in thistled calm tone heightens quiet stakes. Transformation of preservation trope via crystal hum feels organic and hindsight-earned.</comment>
