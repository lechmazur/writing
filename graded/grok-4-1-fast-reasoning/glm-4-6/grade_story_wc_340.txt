<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-driven (warmly inquisitive leads to goggles pickup), with earned change to legacy acceptance; interiority concrete in embodied reactions like fluttering heart and caught breath. Minor slip in tidy epiphany summary ("ready to unfold the new pages") lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: progressive discoveries via floors tighten knowledge to CR closure (final diary entry reconfigures ascent as legacy with felt cost of continued constraints). Orientation anchored early; single scene causality intact, no slips touching pivotal reveals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline walls/ceiling scatter light to constrain discoveries and charge final image (scattered light from ceiling reveals personal note). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (inquisitive notice of glinting goggles); cold spire fogged breath evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ascent/decovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via floor-marked deepenings narrowing to personal stakes; cost legible in final reconfiguration (freedom within hierarchy). Agency in micro-choices like angling goggles drives turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (joy beneath anguish) emerges organically from diary revelations shifting to personal legacy; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (stepping out with goggles/diary). No moralizing; ambiguity in constraints lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (inquisitive filtering of symbols/light); rhythmic prose modulates with rising density, diction fits inquisitive servant. No dialogue; purposeful compression in floor progressions legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; "unfolded" motif purposeful without loop excess. Minor artifact in repetitive "unfolded the edges/secrets/pages" paraphrase slightly dulls mid-beat propulsion, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Goggles-as-light-key decryption transforms trope discovery into fresh mechanic tied to spire physics; legacy twist for servant feels inevitable from accumulative reveals. Bold risk in floor-structured ascent heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
