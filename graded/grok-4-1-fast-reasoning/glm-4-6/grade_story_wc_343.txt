<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in apprenticeship frustration, intensifying to breakthrough; embodied emotions like trembling hands reveal under pressure. Interiority particular to mapmaker's eye for patterns, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—discovery unfolds smoothly without micro-struggle. Final change from apprentice to keeper earned via noting, with felt cost of guarding secret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via pattern observations building density to CR closure: hopscotch as nav system reweights maps, cost legible in folding/protecting notes as "guardian." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph (airship deck, Elias, twilight). No causality breaks; starling mimicry tightens knowledge payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains discovery and charges final covering image; airship's rocking integrates tactilely into thoughts. Sensory hierarchy (visual patterns, fading light) reflects cartographer's bias; starlings evolve causally with twilight, mirroring internal realization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery for respect) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening (decipher coordinates → starling match → luminance concept), narrowing from curiosity to world-redrawing maps. Agency in noting/kneeling; one tightening forecloses ordinary apprenticeship with conceptual cost felt in transformation, though external opposition absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patterns connecting isolation to cosmic/humanity emerges organically via starlings/hopscotch/light; final image reconfigures "sociable isolation" into profound link without stating moral. Subtext in phrasebook words ("light, guidance, pathway") shifts meaning; ambiguity lingers in secret's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (geometric precision, star charts); rhythmic prose modulates from contemplative to charged realization. No head-hopping; diction controlled, syntax varies purposefully for accumulative build—no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., starlings mimicking board advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, read-aloud flows. Minor paraphrase loops in "patterns" motif early, but pattern-taught and purposeful; no heavy artifacts dulling closure image of folding notes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hopscotch/starlings/"stranded luminance" as nav transforms tropes into inevitable cosmic cartography; risk in blending ancient math/birds/light heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Premise feels organic, non-obvious angle on discovery.</comment>
