<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in personal proof of sideways time, driving lever pulls; Elias's micro-choices reveal quiet competence without deep contradiction. Dr. Chen applies light pressure via dialogue, but interiority remains surface-level, lacking embodied conflict in the "subdued awakening."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lever pulls build holographic density to CR closure in nexus revelation and transmission, with conceptual cost of rewritten history legible in final "icy warmth" image. Orientation anchored early at station; one tightening via branching realities suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: nexus's warmth and holographic auroras constrain lever actions and charge final image; xenobiology habitat's "hush of beating wings" mirrors temporal stillness. POV-filtered details (mechanic's hands on gauges) evolve purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lever-deepening holograms narrowing to branching proof; agency in pulls forecloses doubt with subtle personal cost. Pressure coheres but stays intellectual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges organically from projections and nexus warmth, reweighting discovery in resonant CR ending without moralizing. Final "icy warmth" image answers premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of infinite realities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias toward mechanical warmth; rhythmic prose modulates from precise calibration to revelatory pulse. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You were right about sideways"), advancing stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but "mechanically warm" and "icy warmth" loops create minor paraphrase churn across beats; rhythm varies well overall. No filter stacks or heavy artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology station and sideways time via branching nexus transforms sci-fi trope; risk in quiet intellectual climax heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
