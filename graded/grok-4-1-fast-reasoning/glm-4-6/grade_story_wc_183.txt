<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find the garden intensifies consistently through chimeric split, earning merger at closure; interiority embodied in "heart aching with unkindled solace" and chimera stirring, but contradictions summarized poetically rather than dramatized simultaneously during fog resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via unfolding visions and deepening fog to engine room climax, delivering RR closure in ship dissolution and name-plucking with identity cost legible; persistent card/threat constraint shapes path without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rippling ticket booth and fog tendrils constrain choices like path revelation and final tear-free, charging garden's "names hung like fruit" image; sensory details (skeletal grimaces, dying-star lights) filter through chimeric POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wholeness tightens accumulatively through fog pullback at engine room, forcing endurance agency with limb-tear cost; convergence forecloses fractured path unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Trapped freedom theme emerges organically from ship loops to garden embrace, reweighted non-literally by "broken and beautiful" realization tying aberrant halves; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with chimeric signature (shifting horse grimaces) modulates rhythm under fog-thick pressure; stable single-POV distance heightens surreal perceptual immersion cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like pulsing card rippling wood; purposeful "narrative threads" repetition taught early without muddle, though minor end paraphrase nudges below peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chimera navigating narrative threads on carnival ship to name-garden synthesizes surreal identity fresh and inevitably; bold meta-risk (threads recapture) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
