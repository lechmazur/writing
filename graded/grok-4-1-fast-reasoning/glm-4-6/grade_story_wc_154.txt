<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—escape solitude yet engage girl's code—act in scene, earning final self-reframing with embodied coral pulse as cost; coral graft particularizes translator's anxiety without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to decryption beat and CR closure in final coral acknowledgment, cost legible as "pain...returning with sharp...edges" yet mapped to peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and coral constrain perception/choice (thins to reveal fountain, hums in echo), charging final image where mist clings like "second skin" as body/setting evolves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of solace deepens accumulatively via girl's pressure, agency in decrypting forecloses isolation with felt cost in "old wounds...ache anew" but grafted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of coral "grafted onto his soul" non-literally answers suffering-to-meaning question, reweighting anxiety motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in oceanic, lyrical bias (e.g., "underwater echo") modulates rhythm under pressure; girl's dialogue subtextual and voice-distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pervasive figurative density (e.g., opening "funeral shrouds...twilight’s tears") borders overwriting in reflective beats, muddling propulsion without closure harm; minor paraphrase loops in ache motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coral-as-graft in translator's hand synthesizes fresh angle on redemption, risky lyricism heightens stakes via cast decryption turn grown from particulars.</comment>
