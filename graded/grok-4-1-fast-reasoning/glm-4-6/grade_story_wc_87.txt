<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (celestial distrust vs. terrestrial markers) drive micro-choices like avoiding then wielding the compass, earning the genuine laugh and course shift with embodied cost of trembling/exhaustion; no closure slips, though minor label-speak ("align heart and action") edges from peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through regret layers and marker failures to compass revelation (needle to self), delivering CR/RR closure with legible emotional cost in lighthouse arrival; orientation anchored early, single-scene coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Utility poles and kayak constrain drift/choices, charging final eastward follow; sensory hierarchy (rust, brine, waves) filters via navigator bias, mirroring turmoil without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift revelation tightens stake (self vs. external navigation), forcing agency in compass use with exhaustion/elation cost; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Compass-to-self reconfigures heart/action premise non-literally, resonating via particulars without moralizing; ambiguity of flickering faith lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with navigator's perceptual signature (pole-tracking, compass warmth); rhythmic modulation heightens anxiety to elation without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; minor paraphrase loops ("backlash of regret") deduct slightly, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Compass-self twist transforms navigation trope into inward journey, fresh synthesis via poles/compass tension; risk in textural build heightens stakes organically.</comment>
