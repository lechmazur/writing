<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lineage compels patient tactics and final rune utterance, earning the confrontation endurance; diminutive titan trait reveals through unhurried palm-dissolved ink vs. pretender's fury. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on summary for internal consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as doubt density builds via message shards to DC closure (droplet shatters illusion with "fine silk tearing" cost); pattern taught early ("rune of drift") across legible time-pauses. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; minor summary of external effects slightly flattens mid-causality before tightening to pretender's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tilting shelves and shifting constellations constrain Kael's prison-weapon tactics and mirror instability, charging final stabilization image; sensory hierarchy (dust/starlight) reflects regal patience. Environment guides ink-dissolve choice in ceramic dish amid decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via doubt ripples to agency-driven flick narrowing pretender's facade; cost legible in "hollow, terrified man" collapse. One tightening (paranoia to breach) suffices, but external whispers summarized off-page slightly mutes on-beat pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of erosion ("water wears away stone") emerges via drift particulars, reweighting lie's fragility in final "crown of glass" image without moralizing. Resonance from Kael's patience vs. pretender's coarseness avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature (millennia-weight eyes, dust-quiet voice) modulates rhythmically; pretender's "loud and coarse" sneer contrasts idiomatically. Minor elision of Kael's interior peaks taught by unpretentious bearing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "graceful collapse"/"drifting" rhythm echoing theme; varied syntax propels to "silk tearing" image. Minor overwrite in "inky blooming like a miniature nebula" and repeated "regally unpretentious" phrasing nudges from peak, but no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh diminutive titan as ink-wielding librarian transforms usurpation trope via drift erosion, inevitable in hindsight; ink pellet's nebula-to-droplet arc risks bold alchemy payoff heightening stakes cleanly.</comment>
