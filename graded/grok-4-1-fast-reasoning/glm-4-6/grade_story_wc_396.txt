<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shael's traits—calm intuition, shadow-laced empathy—drive consistent micro-choices like selecting visions, earning the final reconstitution; embodied acceptance of personal cost in "responsibility they accepted despite the personal cost" reveals depth without epiphanies. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mirror visions build density toward reconstitution; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with crystal reforming and "Equality" whisper, cost legible in orchard shuddering and Shael's grateful caress of restored burden. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse orchard; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via shifting ice floes threatening balance and orchard's humming trees/mirrors enabling visions; final image of calmed floes charges closure. Sensory details like "crystalline snow" and "frost-kissed branches" filter through Shael's intuitive perception without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore crystal before breath ends signaled early via Council; escalation via accumulating visions culminates in third mirror's child decision tightening to pulse of recognition, forcing agency in final press with felt personal cost. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy mapped to action emerges organically from visions yielding "Equality" in intertwined futures; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via shared path despite "different natures." Complexity in burden's acceptance avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadow-laced sensing; rhythmic prose modulates from steady breathing to pulsing crystal, fitting intuitive mind. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "fourteen hundred facets" advancing world/pressure; rhythm varies for propulsion, varying sentence lengths building to climax. Minor overwrite in stacked descriptors (e.g., "shadow-stitched silk") risks density dip but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy-vessel crystal, mirror visions, and anomaly peacekeeper transforms dimensional equilibrium trope; risk in unconventional reconstitution method heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via intuitive build.</comment>
