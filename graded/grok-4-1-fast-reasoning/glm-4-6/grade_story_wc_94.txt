<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "furiously tranquil" state drives micro-choices like tracing the timer and opening the envelope; final shift to cartographer earned by embodied rage/awe. Traits shown through poetic lens on scars/maps without labels dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure when timer clicks off and clouds part, reweighting witness to cartographer with legible cost in enduring scars ("scars would remain"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via envelope opening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit dome and churning clouds constrain isolation and charge final image of parting clouds/moonlight; sensory hierarchy (visual fractures, cold glass/palms) mirrors internal cartography. POV bias filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy censorship via scars-map) tightens accumulatively through timer vigil and envelope opening, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in trembling hands and persistent scars foreclosing passive silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars as resilient maps emerges organically from poem/clouds/observatory; final moonlight sliver offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, reweighting censorship's wounds via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cartographic metaphors and rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity; stable close-3rd POV with no slippage, prose as character in poet's biased noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful scar/map recurrence; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, though minor overwriting in metaphors ("clouds churned like ink") slightly blurs peak but fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet charting scars via storm observatory transforms vigil trope; bus timetable envelope adds idiosyncratic ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
