<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and intensifies through bolder promises, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; label-only traits like "carefully reckless" recur without deep tradeoffs. Final endurance (staying via promises) earns mild cost via ink depletion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: promises build density to Charged Poise closure as symphonies swell and he arrives, with legible cost in shattered ink well; single scene anchors who/where/when early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archive's dust/silence and ink well constrain choices (writing under urgency) and charge final shards as constellation of hope; sensory details (cool glass, humming shelves) integrate purposefully via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust before divergence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via promise crescendo narrowing options (ink depletes); agency in writing forces trade-off with visible cost in well's shatter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges organically from promises unsnarling silence, resonating in final hand-reach without moralizing; shards reweight prior magic with conceptual cost of renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (symphonies as palpable notes); voice modulates rhythmically but minor repetition dulls peaks; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in ending (repeated "promises," "paths diverge," "symphonies" across 10+ lines) dull closure image; template cadence in promise beats and redundant motifs create scaffold drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh magical synthesis of linguistics/promises as symphonies transforms reconciliation trope; ink well's shatter feels inevitable, risking overt symbolism but heightening stakes organically.</comment>
