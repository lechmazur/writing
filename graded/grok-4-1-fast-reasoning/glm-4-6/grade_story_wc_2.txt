<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between fixing impulse and embracing unknown shown in hesitation over unfinished clock and decision to let parts float away; embodied via grinding mind gears and trembling hands. Minor diagnostic label-speak in "uncertainly certain" repetition slightly abstracts peak realization without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to CR closure where clock stops and compass locks, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of abandoned parts legible in pool current scene. Orientation anchored early in workshop; continuous shard progression with one tightening at pedestal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment constrains via water wading, compass tug, and mist guiding; recurring compass and glowing moss charge final steady-needle image. Sensory hierarchy (drip rhythm, earth/decay scent, roar swallowing laugh) reflects tinker's priorities without catalog; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cavern to chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of order vs. chaos signaled early in stuck gears; accumulative deepening at pedestal clock forces renunciation with visible cost of released parts. Agency in improvised descent and laughter amid roar crystallizes stance; no reversals needed, pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically via shifting images (erratic compass to steady, backward clock stopping); final exhale chime reconfigures prior brokenness motifs without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; counter-reading of curse as honesty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in time/clock bias (gears as skeletons, compass as honest); rhythmic modulation heightens descent tension to chamber exhale. No dialogue; purposeful elision of light source builds to payoff without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, atmosphere; varied rhythm propels from drip echoes to roar-swallowed laugh without monotony. Minor paraphrase loop in uncertainty phrasing ("befriend uncertainty," "embracing the unknown") and repeated "uncertainly certain" dulls one beat but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-tinkerer surrealism with chaos embrace transforms trope of cursed artifact via compass's honest refusal; risk in backward-spinning revelation inevitable from established pattern. No derivative templates; bold CR ending heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
