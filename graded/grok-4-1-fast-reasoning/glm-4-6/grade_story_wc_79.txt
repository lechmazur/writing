<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her cartographer skills and father's legacy, driving micro-choices like decoding patterns and pressing the crack; quietly driven trait shows through obsessive isolation with social cost. Final endurance as connection-keeper feels earned by causal buildup. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observations to crack/discovery to whistle-contact, with closure as Charged Poise/CR in the salute and fragile link, cost legible in "fragile connection between worlds." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. One tightening at crack reconfigures knowledge/options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shell-city setting constrains via patterns/cracks guiding choices and charging final dome/whistle image; sensory details (sun-bleached, sweltering, hues) filter through Elara's perceptual bias. Tactile shell-tracing integrates into action. Micro-setting of workshop/dome supplies tools/resources pivotal to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/contact watchers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern-matching to crack to tonal sequence, narrowing to fragile ongoing role with conceptual cost of denial vs. truth. Agency in feverish cross-referencing and playing whistle forecloses isolation. Minor summary of weeks softens on-page pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns binding fates emerges organically from shell-maps to watchers' sequences to closure communication; final image of nightly whistle-play reweights denial/premise with resonant ambiguity of horrors beyond. No moralizing, subtext in "drowning in denial."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's pattern-obsessed perceptual signature; prose texture varies rhythm for intensity (feverish work vs. sunset poise). No head-hopping or withholding. Voice modulates subtly with emotional build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels accumulatively; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene (whispered realizations to hanging notes). Minor paraphrase near "pattern languages" intro and occasional elevated diction in peak decode beat dull slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city and pattern-language decoding synthesize fresh premise organically; watchers-as-guardians twist grows from shell-maps without late rules. Risky accumulative quiet ending heightens conceptual stakes coherently.</comment>
