<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scholar's reticence yields to urgency in whispering words, revealing contradictory impulses of academic drive and aching loss; final grasp of crystal earns realization as witness with embodied cost. Interiority concrete via fingertips on crystal and heart's drum. Minor abstraction in "weathered innocence" but traits shown through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound memories build density to CR closure in "he finally understood" and crystal grasp, reweighting growth as decay with conceptual cost legible in final luminescence. Anchors clear at opening window press. Single scene causality tight via word experiments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library's hush and dawn chill constrain experiment, crystal as micro-setting charges final image; sensory hierarchy (fogged breath, rustle) reflects scholar's priorities. Details tactile/lived, evolve with sounds. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth) signaled early, tightens via "silence" cascade forcing realization; under accumulative lens, density reweights to decay's geometry with felt cost in role as witness. Agency in word choices narrows options. One deepening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of language's decay emerges via crystal sounds, not statement; final image reprices growth as "graceful falling away" with resonant ambiguity of beauty/terror. Particulars (chime, exhalation) build irony. No moralizing; invites reflection on endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in sonic bias ("shimmer of sound bloomed"); rhythmic modulation peaks in cascade, diction scholar-specific (slurred utterance). Minimal dialogue natural. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges hush. Minor overwriting in "symphony of an ending" but purposeful for tone, no loops or muddle at closure. Sensory specificity propels without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic crystal premise fresh, transforms silence trope via memory physics; risk in lyric accumulative pays off in CR, inevitable hindsight via early chime discovery. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
