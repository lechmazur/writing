<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation rooted in loss is consistent and intensifies through daily ritual, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance feels earned yet static without micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict summarized rather than embodied in pivotal ritual moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dawn charting to evening completion, closure as Charged Poise in final image of shining histories reconfiguring isolation with felt cost of town's silence. Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and workshop glass constrain isolation and charge final image; sensory details (dew, hum, gold leaf settling) selective via studious POV, mirroring internal preservation. Micro-setting of lamp/workbench evolves causally with ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving textures escalates accumulatively via ritual success and 12 completed cards, narrowing to endurance against erasure; cost legible in town's silence pressing but not claiming everything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid silence emerges organically from ritual/actions to resonant final image reweighting invented histories as antidote; ambiguity in "invented" vs real lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with studious perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm modulates from precise charting to incandescent satisfaction, diction controlled and biased toward textures/light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("equations that only he could decipher") slightly blurs peak embedding moment; no loops, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lamp-hum refraction into textured stationery transforms preservation trope; risk in mystical-yet-mathematical premise feels inevitable, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
