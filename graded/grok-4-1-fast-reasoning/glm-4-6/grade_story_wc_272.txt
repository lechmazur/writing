<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Concrete micro-choices like aligning splinters and tracing card edges reveal character under pressure, earning the shift to creator; however, italicized rhetorical questions like "*What if the fractures are where the light gets in?*" deliver diagnostic epiphanies without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbolic density builds from shattered box to mended vessel, delivering Charged Poise closure in brush pickup with legible cost of "descended into necessary darkness"; orientation anchors immediately, one tightening via hardening resolve suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse library's shrinking walls and swaying tide constrain resolve and mirror internal fragments, charging final image of receding walls into opened world; sensory selection (sticky salt, waterlogged shelves) filters through artist's ache without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-rebuild escalates accumulatively through wall-closing pressure to thread-untangling agency, narrowing options with embrace of darkness; cost felt in deliberate mending process foreclosing prior crestfallen stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fractured beauty emerges organically from box-mirroring-life images shifting to luminous portraits; final brush stroke reweights premise non-literally without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in ache's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward luminous metaphors and fragmented motifs, with rhythmic modulation under resolve; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors like "splintered wood scattered across the floor like fractured memories" pervade beats, creating mixed-vehicle muddle and paraphrase loops on "fragments/threads" that dull propulsion; rhythm varies but density sacrifices clarity in peak rebuilding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot fragments in lighthouse library transforms rebirth trope through artist's painterly lens; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
