<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from foraging solitude to stranger encounter and eye activation; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "profound silence" and shared relief with felt imperfect cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hanging orchard and ravine constrain timing via storm pressure and swaying containers, charging final tree-braced activation; sensory details like damp earth and lightning mirror exposure vulnerability without overt symbolism.</comment>
