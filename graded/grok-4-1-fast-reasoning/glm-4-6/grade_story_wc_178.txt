<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in ritual economy, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final alignment feels earned yet internal conflict remains surface-level without embodied stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to celestial alignment; CR closure lands cleanly in "world seemed to tilt... veil drawn aside," with legible conceptual cost of ephemerality ("next alignment—perhaps in another lifetime").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via time pressure ("Dawn would bring... inspectors") and palace axis aligning with Cygnus; dusky sensory details (cool tile, humming bricks) charge final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal before regime) signaled early with situational pressure tightening via alignment cadence shift; palm press agency forecloses path with felt cost of abandonment, though opposition low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of empirical-ethereal bridge emerges organically from ritual to "harmony beneath the discord"; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, though some pseudo-profundity in "covenant with the unknown."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in numeric-celestial fusion ("numbers glowed... celestial doorway"); rhythmic diction modulates purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("palace reimagined" x2, "empirically ironic" x2) and dense figuratives slightly blur peak ("humming with a dusky harmony that was part decay, part waiting"); closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as star-map covenant transforms tropes; risk in quiet CR closure heightens cosmic stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
