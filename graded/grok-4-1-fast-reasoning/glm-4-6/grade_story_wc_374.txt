<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's synesthetic tastes (copper to cinnamon) embody skeptical hunt turning to acceptance; contradiction acts in sour laugh at forest irony amid pursuit, earning final shift without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying tastes/glows to CR closure ("remained luminous but no longer skeptical"); cost legible in ring's stillness foreclosing doubt, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bluff edge constrains careful movement to convergence; aurora/ring reprise charges final merged lights image, sensory hierarchy (taste-dominant) mirrors emotional meteorology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find weather-carriers) deepens via ozone intensification narrowing to him; agency in following forecloses isolation with felt acceptance cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>His line ("We all carry weather because Earth never stopped loving us") borders thematic echo, undercutting subtext despite resonant final embrace image reweighting separation premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature via taste/light diction; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, dialogue thunder-voice fits without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines (e.g., ring warms/tastes ozone advances plot/sense); purposeful taste repetition pattern-taught avoids loops, minor overwriting in "terrestrially cosmic display" doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of weather-emotions, forest elections, taste-compass transforms tropes; risk in lyric CR (cinnamon nostalgia for future) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
