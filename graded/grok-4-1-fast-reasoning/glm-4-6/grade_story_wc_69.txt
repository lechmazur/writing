<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motivation to unite voices through music is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies via the rehearsal payoff; interiority concrete in her fingers tracing the rosette and softening resignation to wonder. Contradictory impulses (resignation vs. hope) act in the student pairing moment. Students as group apply collective pressure without individualized depth, a minor scope slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitary reflection to choral harmony, tightening at students' perfect fifths with cadence shift to CR closure. Orientation anchored early (Eleanor in library with rosette). Cost legible in final image: her enduring mission against "slipping away" arts, felt in lamp-lit resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's velvet hush, autumn leaves, and dust motes selectively mirror internal harmony quest; rosette as micro-setting constrains explanation and charges final desk placement. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward musical resonance. No slips; object recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving arts to unite divides) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "subtracting noise" in rehearsal, forcing stance crystallization in student unity. Agency in coaxing voices; cost felt in administrative dismissal echoed against success. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of diversity's harmony emerges organically from rehearsal events and rosette's encoded scales, culminating in non-literal final chord/image reweighting divisions without moralizing. Subtext in feuding descendants' shoulders touching. Resonant aftereffect via "music hidden in differences."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (musical metaphors, stillness-noted); voice modulates rhythmically from resignation to wonder. Dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual ("Music doesn't vanish accidentally"). No head-hopping; diction fits educator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; sentences vary openings, propel via image-action weave. Minor overwrite in repeated "subtracting noise" (purposeful pattern) and metaphor density, but no loops obscuring closure; ear-test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rosette's encoded notations uniting feuding choir via vanishing zither arts; transforms teacher trope through specific immigrant history and "denote" mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
