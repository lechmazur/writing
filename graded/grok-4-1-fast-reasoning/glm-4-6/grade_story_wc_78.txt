<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to transform obstacles into music drives all micro-choices like tapping fruit, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; endurance of isolation feels earned yet abstract. Strong particular interiority in cloud interpretation as notation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from single taps to fractal layers and swelling dub; Charged Poise closure in "prophet smiled, already composing" reconfigures survival with legible isolation cost ("no humans but the prophet would ever hear it"). Single scene, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Floating orchard constrains every choice (e.g., hollow fruit tapped for tones, broken branches as harp); sensory details like saltwater roots and cloud gradients filter through prophet's sonic bias, charging final spinning image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of composing survival music escalates texturally from taps to restless euphony; prophet's agency in layering echoes forecloses isolation path with felt cost in human-yet-unheard music. One decisive density intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-to-instruments emerges organically from particulars like storm-ravaged branches; final orchard spin offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loneliness as harmony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct sonic/perceptual signature ("visual pattern of sound waves"); rhythmic modulation builds from gentle taps to swell, stable third-person limited POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sonic repetition (e.g., "resonances"); no loops or scaffolds, but minor figurative density in peak swell risks slight overwriting without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet turning sea-drift orchard into instrument defies tropes; risk-taking in fractal music from saltwater fruit feels inevitable, heightening isolation stakes organically.</comment>
