<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in patience with bonsai versus courage deficit with Aiko, embodied in hesitant "I regret" to sea breeze; micro-choices like tracing lace reveal values under remembrance pressure. Final endurance of regret with new possibility feels earned via prior causality. Minor abstraction in recited emotion instructions edges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from erratic compass to steady on 23-year pine, culminating in horizon point as Charged Poise RR with cerulean cost legible in final cuts. Orientation anchored early in islet/bonsai setup. Single tightening via lace-tracing suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai pines and antique lace as micro-settings constrain choices, charging final shears on pine that mirrors 23-year marriage. Sensory selectivity (salt air, wet earth, waves) reflects POV urgency, evolving with tide to mirror internal tides. Ancient pine recharges closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to navigate unspoken apologies via tools—tightens texturally as needle steadies on pine, narrowing to horizon possibility; agency in lace-tracing and pruning forecloses drowning path with felt cerulean cost. Escalation coheres accumulatively without reversal overload. Declaration tests concretely in voiced regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of navigable emotions emerges organically from bonsai/memory parallels, answered non-literally in horizon shift reweighting regret without moral. Recurring lace/compass motifs accumulate resonance, avoiding platitudes. Final image offers complex ambiguity on apologies' color.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (trees as worlds, stitches southward), modulating rhythmically with slow-spoken grace under remembrance stress. Stable close third-person POV filters all via Kenji's bonsai bias. Compression of memory tides taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rhythmically placid grace" advances voice/setting/action); varied rhythm breathes with scene. Minor density slip in clustered water metaphors risks coherence in mid-beat, but pattern-taught and purposeful. No loops; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai emotional pruning, lace-encoded diffusion, cerulean regret transforms regret trope via ghost compass logic. Risky solo lyric scene heightens internal stakes organically. Horizon close inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
