<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies convincingly from ache to authoritative speech, with micro-choices like packing essentials revealing resourcefulness under pressure. Interiority concrete and linguist-specific, as in tracing spidery script. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+; endurance of Kael's transfixion feels earned but abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of gap-research builds to cadence shift in rotunda speech, yielding RR closure ("The path that formed led...inward"). Orientation anchored early (Elara, diary, Stack). Cost legible in "sorrowful, terrible understanding" and imprinted hearts; constraint of diary syntax shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore as language constrains choices ("grammatical loophole," aisles dead-ending), charging final image of river of light. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (scent as "unheard symphony," light flat/gray). Environment guides via "pressure points in...unwritten lexicon"; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue via deciphering) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from routine study to speech narrowing options. Agency in "recited...catalogued the missing ones," with cost in mountain's groan and Kael's broken transfixion. One tightening sufficient; price alters outcome visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge in gaps emerges organically from diary lacunae to library of unlearned lessons, resonating in final image of "every mistake humanity had never made." Non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity in Kael's sorrow lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (linguist notices syntax, gaps). Voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating to chisel-like syllables in speech. No head-hopping; diction fits (e.g., "spidery script," "lacunae"); purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in climax: "The bookstore shuddered"). Metaphors coherent and purposeful ("syllable...chisel"); no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "ripple against...deafening volume" borders density issue but supports tone without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bookstore consciousness as grammar, rescue via "renegotiate its very nature" from gaps. Risky linguistic mountain premise transformed organically; no tropes unearned. Final reconfiguration ("quiet hum...imprinted on their Hearts") inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
