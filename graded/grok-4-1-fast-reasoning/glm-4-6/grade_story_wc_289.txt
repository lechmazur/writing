<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority tied to ghostwriter profession reveals motivation through embodied obsession with frayed thread; realization integrates secrets as tesserae with conceptual cost. Minor unearned leap in flood of secrets borders diagnostic, but prior whimsy earns shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: twig-to-sculpture density builds to on-page CR where secrets prism into mosaic, reweighting separation with irrevocable weaving cost in emerging image. Orientation anchored early at temple; one tightening via echo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory post-storm details (ozone, dripping jewels, glassy pond) filter through Elias's sigil-seeing bias; twig spiral and sculpture corridors constrain path and charge final temple reprise. No white-room; choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoin thread) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via twig pull and sculpture echo narrowing to flood realization; agency in tracing spiral forecloses separation with felt integration cost. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected secrets emerges organically from spiral/prism images culminating in non-literal CR: Elias woven into tapestry, reweighting prior letters without moralizing. Resonant final temple image answers question of separation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (nests as galaxies, ribbons as God's-wort) modulates rhythmically; stable single POV biases noticing toward sigils. Compression taught early via patterns, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and high density propel via purposeful metaphors (prismatic drops, living kaleidoscope) without muddle; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect. Minor figurative density in climax slightly risks overwrite but patterns cohere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter seeking literal thread via nature/art spirals post-storm transforms epiphany trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight from twig-to-mosaic payoff.</comment>
