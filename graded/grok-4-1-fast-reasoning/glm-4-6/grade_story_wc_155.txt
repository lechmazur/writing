<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in ritual (tracing smile, heart swelling), with motivation rooted in grandmother's stories compelling the key choice; minor slip in visible internal contradiction or struggle, as process feels smoothly competent without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment cue to intensifying light/vision, tightening to fade with energy cost; on-page Charged Poise closure ("quiet satisfaction settled... light it cast... would linger") reconfigures lost joy premise with felt pang and discovery thrill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp fog humming, mossy wall, apple scent in vision) selectively mirror Elara's priorities and evolve causally with light ritual; fragment/stone wall as micro-setting constrain ritual and charge final tuck-away image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light gamble intensifying then waning with energy cost; one meaningful deepening forecloses permanence, forcing acceptance of temporary thrill/pang.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of art resurrecting lost joy emerges organically from ritual events and fading vision, with final image ("even things lost... can be brought back into the light") offering resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (light as conduits for feeling, painting memories); rhythmic prose modulates from pensive setup to swelling intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("breath hanging like tiny ghosts", "splinter") slightly muddles peak vision build; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muralist "painting with light" to resurrect memories transforms familiar lost-time trope via film analogy and ritual gamble; risk-taking in Accumulative vision-fade pays off in inevitable, charged closure.</comment>
