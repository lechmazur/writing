<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in glazier's craft shines in ripple readings, earning purpose reaffirmation with felt cost of transience; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as insights unfold declaratively without internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through seven rings to CR closure in "mist began to dissolve," reweighting premise with legible cost of fleeting insights; single scene anchors who/where/when by paragraph 1, holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist and dawn light constrain timing of readings and charge final image as "greedy light devouring the subtleties"; sensory details (wet sand, plink) filtered through glazier's prismatic bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to illuminate mundane tightens accumulatively via ring revelations narrowing to self-reflection; agency in deeper communion forecloses mist's magic with on-page cost in sun's rise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in simple emerges organically from ripple particulars, resonant CR in "next panewould be his clearest yet" reweights without moralizing; lingering ambiguity of storm/future enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of prismatic noticing; voice modulates poetically but repetitions strain rhythmic control under sustained observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("before everything shifts" x4, "prism atrium in mist" x3) and template cadence in ring descriptions ("first ring spoke...second whispered") create paraphrase churn, dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft and ripple-oracle transforms stone-skipping into noctilucent communion, risking lyric overkill but heightening stakes through irreplaceable perceptual frame.</comment>
