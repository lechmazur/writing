<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in brother's death drives ritual choices with embodied cost; micro-choices like hiding key and reciting words reveal contradiction between casual exterior and obsessive quest. Interiority particular via sensory quest, no stock epiphanies. Minor backstory summary in dive slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via ritual progression to CR closure in "soft violet blue... exact color of waves hitting beach glass at dawn," reweighting sensory premise with conceptual cost of fulfilled vow; orientation anchored by ~50 words. One tightening at shimmer deepens stake. Lens holds cleanly to seagull image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains climax via glass cases and key; lanterns recur to charge final perceptual shift. Sensory hierarchy (visual glow, hummed frequencies) filters through lamplighter bias. Spatial choreography tracks pier-to-depths seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled early tightens accumulatively via festival alignment and recitation, forcing perceptual trade-off; agency in humming triggers vision with cost of narrowed life "consumed... since his brother's death." Escalation coheres under lens, cost legible in dawn return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden sensory truths emerges via lantern vows and synesthesia ritual, resonating in final seagull streaks without moralizing; CR reweights loss/redemption obliquely. Subtext in "hides behind truth" layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in luminous/color diction; voice modulates rhythmically to peak hum ("water begin to shimmer"). Brief Marina dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping, diction fits questing lamplighter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "soundless symphony" propel without muddle. Minor overwriting in "luminous vow... promises made and kept" risks paraphrase near opener, but no closure touch or loops. Propulsion clear in ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia ritual in sunken library transforms loss trope via festival alignment; fresh perceptual CR ("colors sounded like loss... redemption") risks poetic tone successfully, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
