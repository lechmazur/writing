<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elea's motivation to intuit thresholds roots consistently in her father's legacy and her gift, compelling the realization choice; interiority shows via tracing patterns and palm-pressing, embodied yet not deeply contradictory. Mild flaw: "featherly determined" labels trait without visible tradeoff in pivotal wood analysis, reducing tension in peak insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wood grain, logbook codes, and light fractures builds to CR closure in final image of smile and pattern-tracing, reweighting loss as navigation with conceptual cost of honored separations. Single scene anchored early (Elea kneeling on terrace); no orientation debt. One tightening via "sudden clarity" moment narrows to guardian stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and warped wood constrain choices, charging final image where light fractures silhouette her; sensory details (fractured light, grain flow, marshy infinity) selective via POV bias toward patterns. Wood from old threshold mirrors internal divergence insight, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why thresholds sacred) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via logbook/wood alignment to stance crystallization as guardian; cost felt in "necessary distances unbridged." No agency-driven reversal needed under lens, but lacks visible tradeoff in peak "sudden clarity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds as necessary distances emerges organically from wood analysis and logbook, resonant in final "invisible threads" whisper reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like grain anomalies shift meaning; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing); voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating to hushed intensity. No dialogue. Minor register elevation in "featherly determined" jars slightly with embodied moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops (repeating "thresholds," "distances," "necessary separations" across paragraphs) and synonym churn (patterns/geometries/fractures) dull density in reflective beats; "featherly determined" repeated without variation creates template cadence. Rhythm varies but overwrites peak insight with stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly effect literalized into maze-world fractures, transformed via wood-grain navigation; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via father's logbook payoff.</comment>
