<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied in haggard perceptions sharpened by insomnia; motivation to thresh meaning drives micro-choices like tracing rain trails and the exchange. Contradictory impulses emerge in art demanding wakefulness at personal cost. Minor label-speak ("wryly earnest") slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of rain trails, amber, and memories tighten to CR closure where insomnia reconfigures as invitation with conceptual cost of eternal vigilance legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (Elara on Merrow's Point post-wars). One meaningful deepening at brooch exchange pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal island's brackish edges and convergence constrain path and choices (rain trails guide to stranger); sensory details (canvas-stained fingers, pulsing amber) filter through painter's bias and charge final image. Weather (rains, tides) evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning from convergence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via stranger's arrival and exchange that narrows isolation into shared purpose under Textural lens. Agency in brooch swap forecloses solitary path with felt cost of ongoing insomnia; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared experience across time emerges organically from particulars (rain trails, amber exchanges, vortex memories); final CR reweights premise without moralizing—"insomnia... her invitation" offers resonant answer with lingering ambiguity. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature (haggard awe in noticing rain secrets); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating with intensity. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("You seek to thresh meaning"), advances plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies for awe (lyric trails) to peak swirl. Minor paraphrase loops ("wryly earnest" recurs without fresh pressure) and slight overwriting in reflective blocks deduct, but no closure touch or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal isolation, amber artifacts unlocking temporal convergence transforms tropes (insomnia as gift) via specific logic; risk in CR ending heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
