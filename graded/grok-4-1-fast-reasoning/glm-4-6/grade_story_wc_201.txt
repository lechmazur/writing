<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement embodied concretely through ground tilt and joint awareness, rooting motivation in trauma; final shift from survivor to pioneer earned via mask phantom pressure. Minor slip in formula's sudden arrival feels diagnostic, but doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: trauma overlays build density to CR closure where equation reweights mercy premise with cost of persistent disorientation; "forest...first variable" image makes before/after legible. Orientation anchored early in waking fog; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Violet glow pulsing and softening charges final path image, constraining proprioceptive disorientation; bark/earth tactile integration mirrors internal states purposefully. Recurrent light evolution guides choice without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tremor/trauma deepening to stance crystallization; agency in bracing against memory forecloses victimhood with felt outsider cost. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in receding pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as "∫(k/R)" emerges organically from trauma calculus, resonant CR reweights pain-to-growth without moralizing; final step integrates protagonist arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in heightened spatial awareness; diction/rhythm modulate from disoriented fog to clarified poise, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, minor "phantom pressure" reprise purposeful without loop. "Квартет" anomaly jars slightly but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Proprioceptive math of mercy in UV forest synthesizes trauma into fresh premise; risk in conceptual CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from mask trigger.</comment>
