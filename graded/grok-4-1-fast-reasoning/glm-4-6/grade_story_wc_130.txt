<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in tracing patterns and sizzling tears; contradictory optimism vs. grief drives micro-choices like nightly returns. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("mathematics of emotion") slightly abstracts peak realization without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: ritual builds density to pattern shift and vision's CR closure with emotional cost legible in tears on stone. Orientation anchored early in cavern orchard pilgrimage; no slips touch ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (drip-drip-drip, glowing fruit) constrain ritual and mirror emotional transformation; mosaic stone and stalactites charge final image of steam wisps rising.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map grief mathematically) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to vision's deepening that forecloses "solving" path; cost felt in tears and lighter eyes, but internalization dominates over sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-transformation emerges organically from particulars like pulsing eyes and shifting mosaic; resonant CR ending reweights ambiguity without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "space to inhabit."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of inventive mapping (equations of emotion); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise in final image, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful repetition (drip-drip) builds texture, but minor paraphrase loops in "gently inventive" phrasing slightly dulls mid-buildup without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional mathematics in bioluminescent orchard transforms grief tropes; risk of lyric accumulative ritual pays off in inevitable-feeling CR, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
