<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in preservation duty, shown through repeated consecrations that intensify with deeper whispers. Interiority concrete via peripheral awareness and embodied gestures like fogging breath. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; honest nature feels labeled rather than complicating a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whisper density builds to pattern break in deeper layer access, culminating in CR closure via expanded clearing and mask image with parapet's exhaustion as felt cost. Single continuous scene with orientation anchored early ("half-masked line walker moved through the murmuring pavilion"). No causality breaks; echo voice motivates second consecration seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: pavilion walls hum, parapet grinds, crystalline ground cools knees, constraining consecration acts. Murmuring pavilion and parapet evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; mask as recurring micro-object charges final image. Environment shapes tactics, like parapet reinforcing foundation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom's echo) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deeper whispers forcing second consecration under lens. Agency in kneeling and palm placement forecloses forgetting with parapet's last energy as visible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving truth in silences emerges organically from consecrations and echo voice ("Preserve not just the words, but the truth within them"). Final mask image offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting words vs. pauses. Avoids platitudes through particulars like crystalline expansion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: peripheral awareness filters sensory hierarchy (vibrations, rustle over direct ears). Prose texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm with pressure (short sentences in consecration). No dialogue or head-hopping; diction fits honed line walker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (tempest whispers to stillness), high density in integrated details. Minor paraphrase loops ("he knelt" twice, whispers swirl/grow) and repetitive stems slightly drag momentum, but no closure touch. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to mask finale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements: line walker's peripheral awareness transforms preservation trope via pavilion/parapet mechanics. Mask's cracked half and whisperfield calm offer non-obvious angle on memory/endurance. Organic integration without hedging; final image risks quiet boldness.</comment>
