<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Langdon's ethically playful nature shines in laughter at the pedestals' dilemma, earning the rope-bridging choice through prior micro-choices like pocketing it instinctively; contradictory impulses toward knowledge and nuance act in scene without tidy rationalization. Interiority particular via poetic perceptions of time's texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers densify to final chamber's CR closure, where rope fusion reconfigures choices with conceptual cost of accepted contradictions; orientation anchored early in grotto, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto patterns and starlight constrain discovery, charging final rope bridge; tactile rope fibers and shifting whorls integrate via goal-directed tracing, mirroring internal paradox without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to grasp time's texture escalates texturally through deepening layers to pedestals' trade-off, resolved by agency in tying rope that forecloses binary with fusion cost; pressure coheres to undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of woven contradictions emerges organically from rope/pattern actions, final tapestry image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in nuance over resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "time like a single inch of frayed rope") biases noticing toward geometry/texture, rhythmic control heightens under pressure; stable close third-person, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors taught early (weaving/texture) propels accumulatively, varied rhythm in peak chamber; minor deduction for occasional dense figuration bordering muddle in opening but not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of poet/rope/energy beings yields inevitable bridge resolution, transforming impossible-choice trope via textural discovery; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
