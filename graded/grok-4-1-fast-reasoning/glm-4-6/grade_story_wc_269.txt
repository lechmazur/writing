<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through pattern-building to compel revelation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the pivotal tapping/console beat, leaning reflective over dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("The revelation unfolded slowly... paths disappeared because they were never meant to last"); cost legible in "weight of understanding settling into him like the tide into sand," with rhythm constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station and atlas page as micro-settings constrain isolation and charge final pocket fold; sensory selection (creaking "like a dying whale," salt "and possibility") mirrors flux without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover why paths disappear) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern alignment to foreclose permanence illusion; cost felt in reconfiguration at "coral... transformed," but agency subtle in endurance over decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of flux/transformation emerges organically from coral bleach to path meander, resonant non-literal answer in final "paths hadn’t disappeared; they had only changed"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in hope amid loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with rhythmic perceptual signature ("tapped a rhythmic pattern... vibrations humming"); diction modulates intensity purposefully, eliding backstory via anchors without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied syntax, high density in revelation beat; minor figurative density ("edges curled like salt-fried parchment," "dawn on a fogged horizon") borders overload but pattern-taught, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief via tappable rhythms decoding data/map; risk in lyric accumulative drive transforms tropes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight at console stutter.</comment>
