<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to teach silence comfort is clear and drives micro-choices like placing the vial, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; smooth progression without embodied internal conflict weakens depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from train echo to vial clearing as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise in silence's soothing shift), legible cost in terrace's tension release; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace vividly integrated, constraining via cloudier vial nearing center and charging final resting image; sensory fractals and hums filtered through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance tightens once via vial's cloud-to-clear under Accumulative lens, with agency in catalyzing placement; cost felt in deepening hum and terrace exhale, but no live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence evolving from void to comfort emerges organically via vial/prism shifts, resonant non-literal close in "prisms hummed softly, a final note"; avoids moralizing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with lyrical perceptual signature in "fluidly logical" notices; rhythmic modulation suits hush tone, but minor overwriting drifts from peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in final third ("vial still/clear" x4, "silence comfort/lullaby/friend," "drifted on") dull closure image with synonym churn and template cadence; artifacts obscure propulsion despite early vividness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm glass monitoring noise in drifting prisms transforms silence trope; conceptual integrity in teaching quiet feels inevitable from vial's reprise without hedging.</comment>
