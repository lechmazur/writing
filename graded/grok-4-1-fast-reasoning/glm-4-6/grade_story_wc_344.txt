<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion peaks in "Tears froze on her lashes" during gear assembly, anchoring internal conflict to past memory; motivation intensifies via prophecy symbols matching gears. Minor abstract telling in "rhythm of repair wasn’t about mechanics" dilutes some micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from cautious entry to mirror eruption and gear fusion; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly in "the mirrors reformed... reflecting... her future" with emotional cost legible. Orientation anchored immediately in opening line; one tightening via pulsing mirrors suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirrors and gears as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image, distorting gear reflections to guide assembly; sensory selectivity (crunching boots, humming edges) reflects POV urgency. Frost evolution (groans, melting) mirrors internal repair without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-repair) signaled early tightens texturally in kaleidoscope visions forcing precise assembly; agency in "last gear clicked" forecloses past fractures with felt tears. Cost unmistakable in endured visions of unrecognizable self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mending time fractures emerges organically from gear work paralleling eclipse study; final warm mirrors reweight past/present without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature (eclipse/locksmith lens on distortions); rhythmic modulation heightens in climax pulses. Compression purposeful and legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery without loops; rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in "hall... erupted." Minor repetition of "rhythm of repair" (3x) is motif-taught but borders paraphrase in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith prophecy in frozen surrealism transforms repair trope; mirrors shattering to snowflakes risks bold reconfiguration paying off at closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
