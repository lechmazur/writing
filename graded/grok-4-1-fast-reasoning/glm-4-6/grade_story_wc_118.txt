<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aria's sensitively perceptive trait drives concrete micro-choices like activating the spectral device despite risks, earning her final realization; interiority feels particular without stock phrasing. Minor deduction for brief reflective summaries of backstory that slightly dilute peak embodiment, but motivation compels higher-stakes probe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tapestry examination to diary revelations and axis redefinition; CR closure lands in final wall-stirring image with conceptual cost of preserved knowledge amid loss. Orientation anchored early in silo; one tightening via final ritual entry suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo's "bronze quiet" and "perfect temperature" constrain preservation choices and charge final stirring hint; sensory details like "heavy...stillness" filter through Aria's perceptual bias. Recurring walls mirror internal quest, evolving to faint dragon return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to probe diaries tightens via discoveries narrowing to metaphysical axis realization, forcing preservation decision with felt risks; agency in device activation drives under Accumulative lens. Entry into 8+ via option foreclosure in sealing chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imagination/reality reconnection emerges organically from dragon guardians and axis shift, answered non-literally in wall-stirring image reweighting human loss. No moralizing; ambiguity in faint hope lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "whispers in plaster"; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet description to charged finale. Perceptual bias selective to emotional resonances enhances intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful poetic phrasing like "dragons...pulse with residual energy" propels without overwriting. Propulsion peaks cleanly in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical post-apocalypse synthesizes wall-hearing archivist, dragon guardians, and axis displacement into inevitable CR; risk in perceptual reality feels bold and integrated, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
