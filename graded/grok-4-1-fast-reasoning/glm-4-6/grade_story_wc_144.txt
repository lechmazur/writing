<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Specific blindness embodied in touch/refraction reveals character under pressure; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in repair beats, muting internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure in drone's clear path and harmonic image reconfigures stakes under accumulative/textural lens; blindness/deadline cost felt in final exhale and weight lifted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fountain's refraction patterns constrain blind diagnostics twice, charging final settled water image that mirrors inner clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ship horn cadence deepens drone restoration stake, narrowing navigation options via flaw fix; minimal visceral cost limits tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Final "symphony of repaired things" and drone's "song of direction" resonantly answers blind restoration theme without literal moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blind-specific perceptual signature in touch/sound/refraction sustains distinct voice; minor repetition slippage from prose artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pervasive loops in "mist outside but inside clarity" contrasts (5+ times) and redundant "artificial hummingbird" full-naming dull propulsion; dense figuration overwrites closure beat without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blind artisan's refraction method ingeniously parallels ship voyage, freshly synthesizing disability and repair in textured harmony.</comment>
