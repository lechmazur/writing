<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sebastian's motivation to preserve truth is consistent and drives micro-choices like documenting in code, but interiority leans on diagnostic philosophizing ("rationally rebellious") over embodied contradiction, diluting peak stress in the flood emergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sedimentary discoveries build density to Conceptual Repricing closure ("truth survives in fragments"), with tightening via charts and tremors; orientation anchors early in labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "acrid air" and "condensation trace paths through rust" integrate with action; sedimentary layers and cog constrain excavation choices and charge final emergence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-preservation escalates accumulatively through cog-to-charts deepening, forcing endurance amid tremors; cost legible in rising water threatening artifacts during emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives theme emerges from particulars like cog contradicting myths, resonating in final whisper, but direct philosophizing ("epistemological diversity") borders on stating over subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward artifacts; rhythmic prose modulates in dreams and flood, though stray Chinese phrase disrupts briefly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "competing narratives" and repetitive philosopher mutterings dull mid-section propulsion; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague sewer philosopher challenging myths via cog transforms tropes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from sedimentary particulars.</comment>
