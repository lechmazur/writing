<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in loss intensifies through embodied actions like pressing hand to saucer; internal conflict in "willingly perplexed" vs. grief yields earned endurance. Minor label-speak abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: "lost time doesn't accumulate, it transforms into the beauty that chokes" reconfigures premise with cost of "carry the weight without being crushed." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via portal vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Midnight glade's "choking beauty" and "air itself carried the sweetness... throat tighten" constrain perception/breath and mirror internal state, charging final image. Selective sensory integration via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost time) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via unfastening to vision/repricing; agency in tracing geometry forecloses retrieval with felt cost in "learn to breathe again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically via saucer crack and glade images, culminating in non-literal CR without moralizing; resonance in final "wound that kept her connected."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (ink pulses, temporal eddies) consistent in third-limited POV; rhythm modulates but elevated diction occasionally mismatches grief's rawness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High figurative density ("time pooled like liquid mercury... dewdrops on spider silk") in portal climax overwrites, dulling propulsion; minor "beauty"/"impossible" loops and paraphrase on handprints.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, temporal eddies, and onyx ink transforms grief fantasy; portal vision's "moments preserved in amber" feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
