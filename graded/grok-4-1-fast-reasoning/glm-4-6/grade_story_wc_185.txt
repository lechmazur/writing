<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mapping silence is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the stone to cracks; embodied emotion peaks in "muscles untensing" after bloom. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the conjuring climax, leaning competent without on-page struggle. Final resolve renewal feels earned by prior endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tracing cracks to stone synchronization and flare, delivering RR closure in "sphere of absolute stillness expanded... held the silence in place." Orientation anchored early in caves/ice. Cost legible in "would not last forever" and endless duty, shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "cracks... like rivers on a frozen moon" and "resonant thrum" filter through Lorne's priorities, constraining choices via fracture blueprints. Ice/cracks charge climax handling and final nod to next node. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure hush) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hum synchronization narrowing to flare. Agency in deliberate touch forces trade-off of temporary peace. Cost felt in reprieve's brevity charging "returned to his work... purpose renewed."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance (noise/silence) emerges organically from particulars like disrupted caves to intertwined song. Final image of "hammered repose" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Complexity in endless duty avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: notices cracks/stone vibrations bias. Rhythmic modulation builds to quiet intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated prose, but paraphrase loops on "bloom of hush"/silence/stone glow (e.g., repeated dimming/luminous in final third) dull closure image; synonym churn on quiet variants triggers -0.8. Rhythms vary, no template cadence runs. Minor scaffold in redundant cave/storm motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice-map silence vs. energy chaos transforms tropes; mapkeeper's crack-reading ingenuity feels inevitable. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious premise commits fully.</comment>
