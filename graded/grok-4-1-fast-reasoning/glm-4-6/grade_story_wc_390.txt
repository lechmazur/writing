<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to protect artifact is rooted in traits and intensifies through ritual; embodied emotion in trembling and resolve. Minor slip in label-speak "logically emotional state" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices under pressure align well. Earned endurance in "vigilance renewed" with felt cost of ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from key insertion to vibrations spreading, pattern break in ice releasing sorrows, RR closure as marina transforms with cost in engineer's trembling and lifelong prep. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices. Cost legible in final afterglow and renewed vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice marina constrains ritual via fissure and evolves causally (cracks to light pathways), charging final cathedral image. Sensory vivid and selective (crunching boots, low hum, thick air); POV bias toward vibrations. No slips; environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early; textural escalation in vibrations disarming "hostile intent," narrowing to artifact's clear song. Agency in attuning/ritual; cost felt in bodily tremble. Pressure coherent but low external opposition limits to strong band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of alignment over force emerges organically via vibrations unravelling regret; final image reconfigures marina as cathedral, answering protection query non-literally. Resonance from particulars like ice sigh; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (frequencies, resonances); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, prose texture purposeful. No dialogue; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches scene; rhythm varies, no major loops. Figurative language coherent via vibration motif without muddle in peak (key hum to ice glow). Minor redundancy in "sigh" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh sonic ritual transforms guardian trope; vibrational premise synthesized organically, risk in lyrical style heightens ethereal stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
