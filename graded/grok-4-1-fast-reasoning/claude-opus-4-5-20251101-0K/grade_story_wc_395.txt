<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Helena's obsession mirrors Marcus's, shown through concrete interiority like trembling hands at the message; final pursuit earned by pattern of discoveries foreclosing passive cataloging. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("brightly attentive") slightly abstracts traits without full embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as number patterns densify to shadow profiles and message, yielding CR closure in "She would find Marcus Chen... began to run" with cost of abandoning silo safety. Orientation anchored early in silo/corridors; shards taught via archive walks without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo servers "humming like mechanical ghosts" and "fragments of audio... unbidden" constrain hunts and charge ending stars "burning like distant servers." Sensory hierarchy (echoes amid silence) reflects attentional bias; Nevada night evolution mirrors resolve without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deleted files' persistence) signaled early, tightens via lie-accessed vault revealing consolidated missing data, forcing copy/run agency; cost legible in pounding heart and pocketed drive narrowing to pursuit. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of indelible digital ghosts emerges organically from numbers/patch persisting to testify; final "deleted files never really went anywhere" reconfigures premise non-literally via run under stars. Counter-reading (blessing/warning) adds ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("brightly attentive to patterns that shouldn't exist"); rhythmic syntax modulates from cataloging calm to 3AM urgency. No dialogue; compression of discoveries feels voice-motivated without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ghosts refusing erasure" advancing image/atmosphere; varied rhythm in audio fragments avoids monotony. Minor metaphor density ("mechanical ghosts," "digital fossil") in opener risks slight overwrite but integrates without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social archive as missing-persons vault tied to space crash cover-up transforms surveillance trope via persistent numbers/patch. Risky CR ending ("cold case... very warm") inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
