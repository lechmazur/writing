<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses emerge in the shift from legacy's "burden" settling on shoulders to gift, earned by diary discoveries; final micro-choice to continue mapping forecloses doubt with felt weight, embodied in palm press.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered discoveries (diaries to playback), culminating in CR closure where walls' "dreams of purpose" reconfigure Mira's stance; cost legible in "legacy's burden settled... like accumulated stone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and ash-buried fireplace constrain choices (pushing through green, extracting from roots), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations under fingertips) reflects cartographer's bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover walls' dreams) tightens accumulatively via diaries mirroring Mira's quest, forcing realization trade-off; cost visible in shoulders bearing legacy before reconfiguration to gift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of walls dreaming identity emerges organically from echoes/playback to CR: "consciousness persists... waiting for those perceptive enough to hear it," reweighting burden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (walls "hum," "vibrations that others dismissed") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from exploratory to resonant in final playback beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in "layers of sound compressed... Footsteps... Arguments... Weeping," varying rhythm without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate megastructures, acoustic fossils, dreaming architecture feels inevitable; risk in animistic walls heightens stakes via Helena's filaments charging Mira's closure.</comment>
