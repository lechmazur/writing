<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory skepticism drives micro-choices like approaching the amber despite resistance, earning luminous shift with worldview cost; interiority particular via chemistry lens on memory. No unearned epiphanies; "she was still a skeptic. But she was luminous now" seals earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pilgrims, amber, rain builds to CR closure in "Mira understood suddenly" realization, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of skepticism's foreclosure. Orientation anchored early in ascent; single-shard coherence perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-streaked windows and amber constrain reflection/choice, mirroring internal shift as rain stops for sunlit descent; selective sensory hierarchy (bronze quiet, cool surface) via Mira's priorities charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding aliens' intent amid personal pull) deepens via amber approach into realization, narrowing skeptical options under Accumulative lens; agency in touch forecloses doubt with felt certainty cost, though external pressure mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as molecular continuity emerges organically from fly's preservation and coordinates, resonant CR in descent affirming "recognizing yourself in the amber of time" without statement; ambiguity lingers in ongoing skepticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature academic/scientific (molecular bonds, patterns); rhythm modulates from ascent tension to quiet epiphany, diction biased toward preservation motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "touched the amber's cool surface"); minor metaphor density ("seeds thrown by a careless gardener") purposeful for textural build, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact via preserved artifacts reweights homecoming conceptually; risk in quiet epiphany over action transforms trope, inevitable via fly's irreplaceable reprise.</comment>
