<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via Mira's embodied vibrations and contradictory invisibility (joy/sorrow); Elena's urgent signs force Mira's micro-choice to teach, earning mutual witnessing. Final change—ghosts becoming real—forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. Minor: Elena's sign fluency convenient but anchored in practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Elena's emergence to dawn teaching, culminating in Charged Poise CR—"two ghosts remembered each other...became real"—reconfiguring invisibility with undeniable past-cost weight. Single scene seamless; orientation anchored in first paragraph. No slips touch closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor vividly selective (liquid silver, vibrations through planks), mirroring Mira's silence-mapping; dock constrains intimate teaching, charges final framing. Sensory bias deaf-POV (visual rhythms, felt music). Environment evolves dawn-pink, recharging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve harbor via silence translation—tightens accumulatively as Elena learns rhythms, narrowing to empowered departure; agency in Mira's guiding yields conceptual cost (past grief traded for hope). Pressure coherent, one deepening sufficient; subtle live option (visibility risk) charges end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges organically from Mira's camera-framing and hands-on teaching, resonant non-literal close: harbor "hummed...finding an audience" reweights invisibility without moral. Joyful sorrow ambiguity lingers in "hope tangled with grief."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited Mira-POV stable, perceptual signature (silence compositions) biases details; rhythmic syntax modulates from quiet observation to urgent signing. Signs carry subtext/goals naturally, distinct voices via fluid vs. practiced motions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short signing beats amid lyrical swells); purposeful metaphors (silence torch) propel without muddle. No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs crisply. Minor density in opening metaphors fits accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf silence-conductor + advisor remapping power via signing transforms ghost/invisibility tropes; risk in filmless camera as memory-frame heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from harbor vibrations to humming closure.</comment>
