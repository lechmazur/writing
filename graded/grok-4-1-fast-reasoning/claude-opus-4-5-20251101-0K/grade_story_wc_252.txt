<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's grace shown via dock work fluidity tying to aquatic transformation; contradictory impulses in hiding vs. embracing act in scrimshaw-sharing micro-choice with Jonas. Final dive renunciation earned by prior vulnerability unlock, foreclosing surface ties with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as backstory density primes whale-song tightening to dive; CR closure in "island shimmered, already beginning its slow fade—but not before Mira crossed its threshold" with conceptual cost of vanishing sanctuary reweighting hidden nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe anchors spatially, constraining rest-to-dive via tidal drop; transformed body as micro-setting propels tail-first descent, charging final deep image without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Embracing-nature stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scrimshaw/map to whale call narrowing options; agency in dive forecloses surface path, cost legible in Jonas goodbye and shed scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embracing true self emerges via Treaty-enabled reveal and dive; final "shed scales" image offers non-literal resonant answer to hiding premise, reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with fluid, resonant syntax mirroring Mira's nature; Jonas dialogue subtext of tenderness advances goodbye stakes, distinct from her gill-resonance voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels from pool-edge talk to dive acceleration; high density in whale-song beat avoids loops, with concrete images like "scrimshaw blazed" over generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Treaty detaching violence enables hidden natures' reveal as fresh post-human premise; whale-guided disappearing island inevitability transforms mermaid trope via heart-unlock and fade-cost.</comment>
