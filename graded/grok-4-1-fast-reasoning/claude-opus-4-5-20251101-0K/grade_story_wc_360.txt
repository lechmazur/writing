<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions, like gasping at "loss multiplied by memory," earning the closure realization; minor diagnostic label-speak ("transposed empathy") from lecture slightly abstracts peak without cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building to CR closure in "grief and hope continued their infinite dance" with conceptual cost of endless process; fragment's weaving tightens density once, orienting vividly early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Topaz floor and vanishing stars constrain time/illumination choices and charge final blaze/flicker image; selective sensory filter (crystalline geometries mirroring uncertainty) through Mira's priorities elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (own emotion via math) tightens texturally via fragment's pulse weaving hope into grief, forcing acceptance with legible cost in surrendered resolution; agency in pressing type drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-as-harmony emerges organically from transposition, answered non-literally in equations of "forgiveness, regret"; reweights borrowing without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "approaching but never reaching."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (emotions as equations/sheet music); rhythmic modulation peaks in "She smiled with the drowned poet's mouth and her own heart," controlling pressure flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful figuratives ("wet ink on cheap paper") cohere in pattern, no artifacts dulling "ink-stained and certain" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress, stellar dissolution, emotional algebra transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at "lucid turbulence," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
