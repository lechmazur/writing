<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's fluctuating strength and archival philosophy drive concrete micro-choices like delicate handling despite titan-gear, revealing contradictory impulses toward power/vulnerability; earned endurance in accepting self-contradictions lands with cost in final reflection. Fisherman applies targeted pressure via "no tomorrow" question. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract embodiment pre-peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors Mira/atrium/post-Forgetting by para 2; density builds via documents/dialogue to CR closure—"migrating nature of selfhood... flexibility to be embraced"—with conceptual cost of eternal present legible in final garden image. One tightening via fisherman's probe reweights preservation stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains via rising waters touching gear feet, forcing stance adjustment in closing lines; wintersun light, saltwater rhythm, moon-calibrated gear filter through Mira's priorities, evolving with tides to charge final peace image. Sensory balance (visual/tactile hum) purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder amid no-tomorrow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fisherman's question forcing stance crystallization; endurance agency forecloses singular-truth path with felt cost of contradictory coexistence in documents/self. Pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Migrating identities theme emerges organically from jumbled photo handling and Mira's smelting philosophy, resonant CR in "tending contradictions like a garden" reweights routine vs. wonder without moralizing. Subtext in fisherman dialogue implies shared loss; complexity embraces identity flux.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with Mira's perceptual signature (tidal/archival metaphors) biases details; rhythmic prose modulates serenely, dialogue natural/subtextual ("migrating identities") advances stakes. No head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative peaks like "Always"), purposeful repetition (tides/moon) taught early without loops; no artifacts, concrete propulsion integrates setting/action seamlessly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-temporal library, moon-tide exoskeleton, sea-migrating identities transforms preservation trope; bold conceptual risk in tomorrow-less stasis heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via atrium logic.</comment>
