<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior conflict peaks in hesitation before unfastening—"To take it meant to continue... letting those histories sink"—earning the commitment with embodied cost of foreclosed normalcy; contradictory impulses act in scene via grandmother's guiding hands felt against choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of revelations (pull to stall, hidden shard, light vision), culminating in CR closure when fragment frees and reconfigures city perception with conceptual cost of eternal between-role; orientation anchored in first paragraph climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Swaying cables and platforms constrain ascent/movement, phosphorescent lanterns filter amber shadows through Mira's intuition; final vision of "ghost-markets and shadow-streets... every swaying cable" charges closure image as recurring setting reweights worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim inheritance via fragment) tightens through recognition ("There... behind it") narrowing to hesitation trade-off; agency in unfastening forces stance crystallization under lens, cost legible in "weight and weightlessness of choosing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of revealing erasures emerges via particulars (carved names as cracks, lens light on overlooked layers); final image of illuminated city offers non-literal answer reweighting "overlooked histories" without moral, resonant via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("neither touch nor sight but something between") modulates rhythm to peak compression in "eternal instant"; brief dialogue distinct ("I translate them") carries subtext of inheritance recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from market sway to climax stretch; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (worlds "overlapped like translucent pages"), rhythm breathes in "moment stretched, becoming an eternal instant."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden-shard paintings as history keys transforms artifact-quest trope; risk in lyric CR ending heightens stakes via "light that remembered how to illuminate," inevitable from intuition anchors.</comment>
