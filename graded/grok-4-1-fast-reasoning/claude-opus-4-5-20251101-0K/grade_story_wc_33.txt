<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation, rooted in father's unkept promise, compels micro-choices like mapping gaps; endurance in final smile earns closure. Internal conflict subtle in desperate cosmic hope versus rule-bending competence. Minor sentimentality in "cosmic ledger" slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from method explanation to exchange, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("Marcus smiled and walked into the gap") with felt risk cost as drone scans nothing. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's perpetual twilight and machine hush constrain choices via mapped gaps, charging final drone pass; sensory hush mirrors melancholy. Micro-setting (neon, cabinets) guides spatial choreography without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver grief, balance personal loss) signaled early via watch; exchange deepens pressure under accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance with ongoing ghost-risk cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stitching wounds via absences emerges organically from bottled storm and letters; final ghost image offers resonant reconfiguration of promises without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical perceptual bias ("cathedral of forgotten games," "brittle hush"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in exchange, distinguishing voices cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel from hush to sob-crack; no loops or scaffolds, vivid propulsion in "lightning flickering like dying fireflies."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone evasion via absences transforms smuggling trope; bottled grief and ghost method feel inevitable, risking lyric poise for stakes heightening.</comment>
