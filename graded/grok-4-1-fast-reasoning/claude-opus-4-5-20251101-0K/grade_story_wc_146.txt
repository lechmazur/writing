<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bell tuner's motivation rooted in patience and balance compels silent, calibrated actions across days; interiority sparse but traits consistent via centuries of waiting. Contradictory impulses minimal, yet final words and fork handover earn closure renunciation with cost to silence. No deep embodiment or flaws complicating mid-beats, but fits single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footsteps and strikes build density to bells' harmony as CR, reframing collapse as seed-fall with legible cost in "buildings folded gracefully... tears tasted like relief." Orientation anchored early (archway, Veradhen); time shards legible via days and 90-year ellipse. One tightening via third-day strike suffices; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobblestones and tower constrain choices (footstep mapping, bell access); archway recurs to frame entry/exit and charge final image with granddaughter's step. Sensory hierarchy via low frequencies/tremors reflects tuner's priorities; wild hush atmosphere tensions hush-to-song cadence. Details evolve causally (cracks appear post-strike).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early, tightens via daily walks to fork-strike reversal narrowing to correct collapse; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights with town's surrender cost. Agency in tuner's calibrated steps; moral calculus (fall for renewal) sharpens peak. One deepening sufficient, cost felt in souls' gathering/weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of destructive renewal emerges from particulars (rhythms wake mountain, collapse as "seed falls"); final image reprices ghost revival without moralizing, reweighting hush with mountain's song. Subtext in silences and vibrations invites ambiguity (relief in tears); no tidy binaries, complexity in inevitability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on tuner, perceptual signature in frequency/resonance bias; voice modulates hush-to-song rhythm purposefully. Single spoken line natural/subtextual, pursuing handover goal; no head-hopping, diction controlled and mystic without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "note... was not sound but memory" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (frozen midnight tines); propulsion builds to collapse without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bell tuner engineers collapse-revival via frequencies transforms ghost town trope organically. Risk in inevitability-as-balance heightens stakes; final reprise (granddaughter's step on "fresh cobblestones") inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
