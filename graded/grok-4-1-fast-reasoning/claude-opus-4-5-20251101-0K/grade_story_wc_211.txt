<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in prophecy speech where grief/wonder frequencies stir leaves; minor diagnostic slip in "junction point" realization but earned via prior causality and micro-choice to continue writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure in final writing image, reweighting life work with conceptual cost; falling apples (12-3-1) as cadence shift tightens perfectly without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard atop tower constrains via reactive trees/apples forming coordinates; sensory filter (bruised plums sky, windless leaves) charges prophecy beat and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to immerse/archive deepens via unbidden prophecy utterance, agency foreclosing backward preservation with orchard's felt response; cost legible in "preparation" reconfiguration under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of oaths spanning time emerges via wax-to-prophecy arc; final cuneiform image non-literally reweights "map to this moment" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in language/emotion noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in "voice wove through the orchard" without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in prophecy lines ("towers that would rise from drowned cities"); varied rhythm propels immersion to charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skyscraper orchard + wax temporal fold synthesizes fresh prophecy frame; risk of ancient math in apples heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
