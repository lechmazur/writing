<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore via song despite non-musical nature shows embodied conflict in cracking voice and blood memory; micro-choices like singing and touching tendril reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete via trembling exhaustion and tears. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting limits peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single continuous scene; orientation anchored immediately in arbor at dawn. Closure as Charged Poise in vine's rejuvenation and Mira's exhausted realization of a "beginning" with felt cost (trembling, incomplete fix) reconfigures forgetting into renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant arbor, moss altar, and dawn alignment constrain the ritual choice and charge final glowing image; sensory details (rustling leaves, pulsing green) selective via Mira's tinkerer bias. Vine tendril as micro-setting mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal vines via sacred song) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through voice-device synergy and alignment climax narrowing to infinite gold-silver moment. Agency in imperfect singing forecloses neglect path with visible costs (cracked voice, tears, exhaustion).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal remembering vs. forgetting emerges organically from vine's tendril grasp, song revival, and final touch; resonant non-literal answer in arbor's glow reweights personal invention with cultural renewal. Avoids moralizing, lingers in "they would not have to wait much longer."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with whimsical perceptual signature (mechanisms catching pink light, blood memory); rhythmic prose modulates from restless tinkering to hushed wonder. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short dawn hush sentences build to sustained notes); purposeful figurative layering (golden stories, blood returning) without muddle. Minor repetition of "forgotten songs" borders paraphrase but anchors motif without obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer ritualizing ancestral songs into machine-amplified magic during celestial alignment transforms eco-fantasy tropes via specific lunar tracking and vine embodiment. Risky quiet Charged Poise ending heightens renewal stakes organically.</comment>
