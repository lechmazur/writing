<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong, particular interiority via "empirically intuitive sense" drives micro-choices like following ants and using the chip; motivation rooted in father's promise compels solitude-enduring journey with earned understanding at threshold. Minor diagnostic label-speak in epiphany ("why she had needed solitude") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: map chip → ants → cavern → archway opening → revelation → decision; on-page CR closure via annotated map and embedded chip reconfigures promise as "beginning," with legible cost in abandoned shop implying path foreclosed. Orientation anchored early in shop; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blooming cavern with rising creek constrains choices (hour window) and charges final image of submerging flowers; sensory details (bioluminescence, perfume) selective via POV urgency. Micro-setting (chip depression) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doorway via promise) tightens causally via rising creek narrowing options; agency in pressing chip forces trade-off at threshold. Escalation driven by timed water, but minor abstractness in infinite paths prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of solitary search emerges organically from map pursuit and revelation ("promise was never about the destination"); final map reprise reweights without moralizing. Lingering ambiguity in decision invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual bias (map expert notices watermark, ants); rhythmic prose modulates tension (dripping counterpoint to heartbeat). Father's dialogue natural, subtext-rich.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from shop to climax without loops; metaphors coherent (cracks "like frost across glass"). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antique maps, type chip key, ants guide to multiverse doorway transforms tropes; risk in ambiguous decision heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
