<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between rational engagement and quiet preservation shows contradictory impulses acting in the scene, earning the final conviction; embodied via calloused fingers on cog. Minor slip in diagnostic labels like "rationally rebellious" slightly abstracts peak reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from cog examination to archive sealing; Charged Poise closure in smile reconfigures rebellion with futility cost legible in "stubborn witnesses" carve and empty satchel ascent. Orientation anchored early; one tightening in descent decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers and artifacts constrain movement and supply stakes, charging final cache seal; sensory hierarchy via philosopher's artifact focus (verdigris brass) mirrors priorities. Vivid, selective integration into action avoids white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs zealot erasure) signaled early, tightens texturally via artifact accumulation forcing renunciation of direct engagement; cost felt in isolation and futility during cog whisper agony. Agency in micro-choices like carving forbidden date forecloses confrontation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from layered artifacts vs chants, resonant CR in smile reweighting certainty without moral; ambiguity lingers in preservation's futility. Minor direct statement in "full conversation" tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward artifact narratives; rhythmic control modulates reflective calm to charged ending smile. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., cog turning embodies doubt); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor repetition of "agonized/agonizing" in reflective beats unifies voice without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken sewers as archive transforms post-plague trope via sedimentary narrative layers; fresh synthesis in philosopher's futile rebellion feels inevitable in hindsight smile.</comment>
