<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—routine paintings vs. venturing to ghost-ridden shore—act in scene, earning shift to purposeful wakefulness via embodied exhaustion; final exchange crystallizes without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: convergence pattern tightens from tides/rain to brooch/Theo, landing CR in new painting where "wakefulness felt like witness rather than punishment" shows cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal causeway and rain trails constrain choices (timing, eastern shore avoidance), charging final image of joined hands on horizon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of threshing meaning deepens accumulatively via rain-led discoveries to exchange, narrowing options with tiredness cost legible in "haggard awe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final painting offers resonant answer—convergence as enduring witness—reweighting tides/brooch without moral, emerging from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of paint-stained, sleepless seeker; dialogue subtextual, advancing exchange goals cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; "rain trails reveal where the earth wants us to go" rhythms propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-wars convergence via rain/brooch exchange transforms ruins into mythic seeker draw, riskily quiet CR inevitable.</comment>
