<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's drone mapping and lever pull reveal character through micro-choices under revelation pressure, earning shift from personal closure to network continuation; pilgrim applies targeted pressure via matching chip. Minor weakness: "perpetually surprised" labels interiority without full embodiment in climax realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via chip alignment, lever pull ("gears... began to turn"), and dome projection as tightening, landing Charged Poise closure in Mira's course-plotting with legible cost of endless journey over resolution; single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome cracks forming lens and drone spotlight constrain climax mechanism activation and charge final stellar navigation image; "brilliant dimness" selectively mirrors threshold stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding signal tightens accumulatively via matching chips and hidden lever, narrowing to map revelation that forces continuation choice; cost felt in foreclosed closure during father's trail illumination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Belonging as harmonic network emerges organically from chip/map particulars, reweighting premise in final image of star-trail walking without moralizing; resonant counter-reading of isolation lingers via scattered points of light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via thermal drone gaze and star-filtered details holds single POV steadily; sparse dialogue carries subtext ("Missing pieces") and advances via pilgrim's chip reveal, with natural rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chips clicked into grooves" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak dome-rotation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech decoding ancient human-connection map transforms tropes into inevitable network premise; risk of poetic compression heightens stellar stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
