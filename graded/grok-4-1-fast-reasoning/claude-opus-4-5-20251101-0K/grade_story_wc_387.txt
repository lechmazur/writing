<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and embodied motivation rooted in hidden patterns, with micro-choices like whistling revealing values; endurance of secrecy earns closure without tidy epiphany. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of patterns building to Charged Poise closure; firefly response to whistle confirms 17-year stake with felt cost of unwitnessed grace in "chose to let the mystery remain mysterious." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (dripping gargoyles, firefly lights, wind whispers) filters through POV bias, with parapet and whisk constraining observation and charging final descent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing patterns tightens texturally via firefly-whistle sync, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in ongoing secrecy but lacks deeper trade-off narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from particulars (grandmother's whisk, woven nets, firefly rhythms), resonating in rain's "softly now, as if it too understood" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (mathematical knots, pulsing sequences); rhythmic prose modulates serene intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm (e.g., short final sentences accelerate cadence); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures, fully legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mender philosopher observing firefly-moon patterns transforms quiet lyric trope; risk in accumulative poise heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
