<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in glazier-specific perceptions like "crack in glass told stories of temperature and stress," with motivation to illuminate the mundane driving the final sketching decision; embodied emotions via hands and stone feel authentic. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat, leaning contemplative over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered observations building to Conceptual Repricing closure in "endings were simply patterns transforming into new patterns," with legible cost in atrium's loss reconfigured by decision to rebuild scattered. Orientation anchored early ("edge of Pearl Bay"); single scene coherent, ripples as pivotal tightening pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium and mist-shrouded bay constrain perception and charge final light beams gilding the boat, mirroring internal shift; sensory hierarchy (visual prisms dominant) reflects glazier POV perfectly. Recurring water/glass evolves causally with stone throw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atrium vs. demolition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ripples revealing "atrium could not be saved," forcing renunciation with felt cost in acceptance, crystallized in sketching new plans. Agency via observation/decision forecloses preservation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformative patterns emerges organically from ripples, light, and glass without statement; final image of walking to workshop reweights mundane value non-literally, embracing complexity via irrevocable shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with glazier perceptual signature ("language of physics made visible"); rhythmic prose modulates from stillness to dawn clarity. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid, purposeful images like "beams of separated light... fingers of some vast and careful hand"; varied rhythm propels without loops or overwriting in peak ripple beat. Minor register elevation in abstracts like "noctilucent reckonings" fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft, ripple prophecy, and demolition into pattern-transformation premise; risk in lyric communion via stone throw heightens philosophical stakes organically.</comment>
