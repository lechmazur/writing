<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied patch against thigh and self-blame tied to Vasquez; contradictory impulses (eccentric method vs. dismissal) act in persistence at death spot. Final endurance earned by prior causality (readings confirm pattern) with isolation cost. 9+ test met: impulses in scene, choice to continue forecloses dismissal path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry readings to confirmation at Vasquez intersection, deeper maze. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final image ("prepared to speak second—before the next silence became permanent"), reconfiguring foresight premise with isolation cost legible in "walked...alone". Orientation anchored by para 1; no gate fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Containers as canyons constrain choices (funneling wind to 32 mph) and charge closure (groaning metal, wind breathing). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (anemometer priority over visuals); micro-setting (patch, notebook) evolves with action. 9+ test: recurring containers shape survey tactics and final echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (predict accidents via wind) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively at Vasquez spot ("readings confirmed") narrowing options to persistence. Agency in survey forecloses inaction; cost felt in "someone would listen...until then, alone". High-band entry: live trade-off charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (warnings in wind vs. official denial) emerges from particulars (anemometer spikes, father's patch); final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise ("wind speaks first...Mira listened"). No moralizing; ambiguity in "eventually" lingers. 9+ test: reweights material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (wind as "breathing," "language of almost"); rhythmic control modulates (short survey sentences build density). No head-hopping; diction biased to investigator (hazy sketches). 9+ test: signature holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (wind data integrates action); rhythm varies (long atmospheric openers to punchy readings); metaphors coherent (respiratory labyrinth). No loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks at "concentrated, and released in bursts". 9+ test: zero issues, clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wind as prophetic force in adaptive container maze transforms accident trope via lived detail (nightly shifts). Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in closure echo. 9+ test: non-obvious angle risks clarity payoff.</comment>
