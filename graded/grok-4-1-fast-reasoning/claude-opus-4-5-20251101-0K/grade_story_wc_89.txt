<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict peaks in the metamorphosis—"Terror and peace existed simultaneously"—with contradictory impulses yielding an earned choice to transform, paying the visible cost of humanity lost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent density builds to Kael's appearance and CR closure; cost legible in "She was no longer fully Mira," reconfiguring options without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's silver soil and luminescent fruit constrain ritual placement and charge final image of eternal blooming; sensory details (spices, humming bark) filter through Mira's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie prophecy in phoenix orchard transforms grief tropes; risk of lyric fantasy heightens cosmic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via scent bridge.</comment>
