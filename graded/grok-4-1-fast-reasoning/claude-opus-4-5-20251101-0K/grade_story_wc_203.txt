<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied "pull in her chest" and ghost-seeing history; micro-choice to engage ghost earned by prior dust/ceiling cues, with endurance cost in carrying burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from dust patterns to ghost reveal and mainspring discovery; CR closure in delivery decision with legible cost of altered report and "weightless burden" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust accumulation and water-stained ceiling constrain discoveries (thinner dust signals movement, ceiling hides histories), charging final upward look; selective sensory integration via technician POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of professional assessment deepens to salvaging hidden history via ghost pressure; agency in lifting/committing forecloses neutral report with felt burden cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked cracks/facades emerges organically via dust, mainspring, Eleanor; final ceiling image offers resonant CR repricing memory's thin boundary without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern analysis; ghost dialogue natural/subtextual, advances stakes cleanly without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel observations to closure; purposeful "cracks" motif without loops or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and circus horologist injustice transforms supernatural trope via specific craft/memory stakes.</comment>
