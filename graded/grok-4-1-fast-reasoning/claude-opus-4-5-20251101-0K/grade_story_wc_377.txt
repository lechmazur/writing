<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's mute trait concretely sharpens senses and constrains communication, compelling micro-choices like gaze-intensity to urge ringing; internal endurance of seasonal silence earns final renunciation of voice need. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers perfection, but competence balanced by altitude struggle and sacred weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent/setup to sculpture-building/deepening to ringing/closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with melting ice cost legible in "weeping slow tears" and "remember how to sing truthfully." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity; persistent ice constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment and kinetic sculpture as micro-settings constrain choices (melting urgency, vibration redirection) and charge closure; sensory hierarchy via mute POV (taste bronze, feel dissonance) vivid/selective. "Cloud sea" and parted horizon evolve causally, mirroring internal states through action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bell's truthful harmony) signaled early, tightens via Alcuin's hesitation narrowing options to her gaze-pressured ring; agency in sculpture-building forecloses discord path with ice-melt cost. Accumulative escalation via vibration purification reweights to Charged Poise; minor abstractness in stakes slightly limits visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sound-truth over words emerges via particulars (ice frequencies, sculpture filter), culminating in non-literal answer: parted clouds reveal peaks as wonder preserved. Monk faces transforming echoes core question without moralizing; final palm-to-stone vibration recharges mute inheritance organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (vibration in bones, resonance taste); diction/rhythm modulate from ascent vigor to ringing poise, lyrical yet precise. No head-hopping or withholding; elision of speech heightens gesture subtext, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "sculpture took shape like a three-dimensional musical score" advances action/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (ice "borrowed from another world"). Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mute inheritance, prehistoric ice, truth-symphony into inevitable arc; risk-taking in lyric sound-world transforms tropes (broken bell, monastery) via specific physics (molecular discord). Bold final CR (truth clears fog) heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
