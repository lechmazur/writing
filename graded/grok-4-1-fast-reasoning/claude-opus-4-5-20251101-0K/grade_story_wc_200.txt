<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied fear as "old companion" propel micro-choices like touching the harp; final realization earned by accumulating confessions without unearned epiphany. Minor slip in diagnostic self-naming ("She was a healer") slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density from harp touch (inciting) to spirit confessions (climax); CR closure lands cleanly in laughter/tears with emotional cost ("ache...began to shift"). Orientation anchored early in gorge descent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorge's "throat of striated stone" and echoing footsteps constrain descent and charge spectral voices; recurring light evolution mirrors internal shift to final "glowing" ache. Sensory hierarchy (visual fog/echoes) biases to Maren's uncertainty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self amid lost purpose) signaled early, tightens via harp's "wrong" note summoning grateful spirits, forcing realization with embodied cost (tears). Escalation accumulative under lens, but single deepening lacks micro-reversal for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of joy-as-companion emerges organically from child/soldier confessions reweighting Maren's "instinctive" laughter; final image of glowing ache offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in echoed "ghostly repetitions" and biased noticing (crocodile's tooth warmth); spirit dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via specific memories. Rhythmic control peaks in distorted note description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "notes bent reality" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, even in peak confession cascade. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but serves taught poetic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-guiding with "spectral confessions" via misaligned harp transforms death tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
