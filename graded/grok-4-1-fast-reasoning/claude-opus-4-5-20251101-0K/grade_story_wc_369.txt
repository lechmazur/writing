<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via quantified sorrow units (e.g., "fourteen units" at oak), motivating shift from routine trimming to dream-mapping; final endurance of cypress's forty-one units shows earned renunciation with cost. Minor diagnostic label ("quantified sorrow") borders therapy-speak but embodies quickly in waves felt at trees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density of tree sorrows to cascade vision under CR closure ("numbers cascaded through her vision"); cost legible in "fourteen units of old grief released" reweighting her grief as witnessed/kept. Orientation anchors early (labyrinth, tower, tonight); sextant healing and reassembly tighten purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Specific trees (oak's fourteen, cypress's forty-one) and moonlight constrain sextant action/healing, charging final oak-palm image. Sensory selection urgent (lightning reveals study, moon heals); storm subtly pressures ascent/visibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map tree dreams/sorrows) signaled via Vestris note and measurements; textural deepening in sextant vision forecloses ignorance, agency in de/reconstruction narrows to balance maintenance. Cost felt in partial grief release (fourteen vs. forty-one kept), charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of arboreal witnessing emerges from quantified grief/images (e.g., cypress dreams plague), final image ("trimming hedges, mapping dreams") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting labyrinth as pilgrimage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in precise metrics ("twenty-three when she touched the willow") and mundane phrasing; rhythm modulates with intensity (held breath at healing). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; rhythm propels via varied syntax (e.g., short "The sextant began to heal" launches climax). Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly; zero scaffold in peak vision cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow, dreaming trees, sextant-for-dreams transforms tropes organically; risk in "mundane miracles" premise inevitable via tree metrics to closure balance.</comment>
