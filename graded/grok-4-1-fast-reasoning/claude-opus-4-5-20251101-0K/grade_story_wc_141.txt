<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—skepticism clashes with listening as cello voices compel micro-choice to lift bow again without proof-seeking; final renunciation of certainties earned via prior revelations with embodied grief/laughter cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from cello hums to voices to self-admission, landing CR closure in "pages of her old certainties whispered shut" where cost of foreclosed worldview is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked dome and half-finished cello constrain choices (positioning, playing) and charge final image of stars through wounds, mirroring internal shift; sensory details like rust-echoing boots and November chill selective via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode riddle tightens via cello deepening knowledge of unheard words, forcing agency in repeated listening that forecloses debunking path; cost unmistakable in suspended revelation and wept laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inhabiting riddles emerges organically from cello retellings reweighting "what happens to words after they die"; final image of seashell-to-ear offers non-literal answer without moral, resonating prior skepticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of myth-busting precision softening into lyric wonder; rhythmic control heightens pressure in voice-unfurling lines, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "She positioned herself as one might hold a lover they had wronged"); varied rhythm propels without figurative muddle in peak cello beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via word-retelling cello transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via seashell reprise.</comment>
