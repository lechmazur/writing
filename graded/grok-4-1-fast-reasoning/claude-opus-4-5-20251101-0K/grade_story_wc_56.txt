<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied serene upheaval; final endurance of truth earned by prior chasing causality, foreclosing idealized father myth with emotional cost in letter's collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density to CR closure; radio backstory anchors coordinates to salvage act, with cost legible in "hindsight clarity was a cruel gift" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting handled tactilely, recharging dark at end; twilight canal constrains salvage choice and charges final barge image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (piercing father's legend) tightens accumulatively via salvage/letter, narrowing to carry-or-expose trade-off; cost felt in "collapse of everything she had loved," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lie-architecture emerges organically from sundial inscription, manifests, letter; final image reweights premise with resonant ambiguity on truth's shelter, no moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias toward narrative hollows; rhythmic texture modulates from hunger to serene clarity, diction character-bound without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image/action (e.g., "fingers finding the chain"); varied syntax/rhythm, zero loops, purposeful figurative without muddle in revelation peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of legend-seeker dismantling paternal smuggling myth via radio silence; risk in reflective accumulative payoff heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
