<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's embodied adaptations, like adjusting her smile and locket handoff, reveal contradictory impulses of loss and nurture, earning Maya's closure tears/smile without therapy-speak touching the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via eclipse progression to Charged Poise RR at totality locket exchange; emotional cost of separation legible in "I'm scared" to smiling acceptance, with roots constraint shaping timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dreaming roots recur from imagined networks to final hush, constraining summit choice and charging closure image; sage perfume and eclipse light filter through Elena's ordinary-magic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant separation stake signaled early tightens via Maya's admission under totality pressure, forcing locket agency that forecloses disconnection with relational cost in tears/smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges implicitly from therapist anecdotes, eclipse, roots; locket reprise non-literally answers "becoming" fear, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Elena POV with perceptual signature (harmonies, magic) distinguishes Maya's dialogue idiom; rhythm shortens in totality for pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels eclipse build; no loops or muddled metaphors, roots imagery purposeful without overwriting peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eclipse as ordinary-magic crucible transforms empty-nest trope via roots/locket synthesis; totality timing risks lyric poise, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
