<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meren's motivation rooted in watching "children sob at dead ends"; contradictory impulses peak in "Her grandmother would have called this desecration. Meren called it reverence," earning final sewing choice with tradition-breaking cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from charting paths to "The stitches held," delivering RR/CR closure where merged route reconfigures labyrinth with legible desecration cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red stone grooves and convergence point constrain sleepwalker paths and Meren's sewing; final wall touch charges image, mirroring shift from prison to garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transform cruelty escalates accumulatively via 17-year charting to sewing tightening; agency forecloses punitive path, cost visible as sleepwalkers "moving easily through passages that had trapped their ancestors."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges implicitly from stitching and plate; "orchid solace" final image offers non-literal reconfiguration of tradition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with weaver-biased perceptual signature in "thread could bind more than fabric"; rhythmic control heightens sewing pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to climax; purposeful figuratives like "sew its echo into stone" integrate without muddle or loops in peak stitches-held beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sleepwalker paths into deliberate weave transforms labyrinth trope; risk of breaking tradition heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
