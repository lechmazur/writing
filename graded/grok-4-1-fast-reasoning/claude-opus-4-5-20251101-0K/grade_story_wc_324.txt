<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's persistent curiosity compels her to trace pulses despite loneliness, earning Margaret's peace through micro-choices like translating the hearing aid; internal conflict in effective isolation shown in final atrium solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density in pulse flickers to resolution ("The pulse...smoothed into something like resolution"), delivering Charged Poise closure with emotional cost legible in Margaret's loosened eyes and Vera's ongoing listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium constrains sacred hush, charging final image where "mist had thickened...Vera stood among the ferns and the fog"; sensory details like echoing footsteps filter through Vera's pulse-attuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of enabling forgiveness tightens via pulse strengthening on "jealous" and "afraid"; Vera's assurances force stance crystallization, cost felt in thread completion and her lonely persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voices needing bridges emerges implicitly; final "already listening for the next signal" non-literally answers listening's cost, reweighting curiosity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pulse-static and mist; Margaret's halting dialogue carries subtext of buried jealousy, distinct from Vera's steady voice, advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in "Static. Then, beneath it, a pulse—irregular, hesitant, but present" propels without loops; rhythm varies to hush-deepening cadence, no artifacts dulling peak pulse resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hearing aid pulses transform ghost-contact into electromagnetic echoes, synthesizing fresh incidental heroism; risk in quiet supernatural closure feels inevitable from atrium's thin spaces.</comment>
