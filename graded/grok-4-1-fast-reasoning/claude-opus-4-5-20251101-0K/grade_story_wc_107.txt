<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of community vs exhilaration) act in scene via embodied reactions like hammering heart and final pocketing of bookmark; earned choice forecloses isolation with felt cost of inherited abandonment parallel. Internal voice specific through narration habit, flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lever pull ("red light flickered") to sketching plans, delivering Charged Poise closure where bookmark pocketed reconfigures isolation into outreach with conceptual cost of solitude's end. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-weeping console and dripping water constrain choices (melting signals incoming others, forcing timeline); final sketching on dusty floor charges image, mirroring internal thaw through POV-filtered glassblower priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs communal inquiry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via power flicker and melting ice that narrows options; agency in renunciation of solitude carries visible terror/exhilaration cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of contained curiosity emerges organically from glass vessels, thawing motifs, and bookmark reprise, offering resonant non-literal answer in "sketching layouts for workstations and containment chambers" that reweights father's despair without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theatrical narration creates distinct perceptual signature ("the contemplative glassblower removes her coat"), rhythmic control modulates with intensity; stable single POV, purposeful compression in self-narration enhances pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., varying narration rhythms avoid monotony); thawing metaphors consistent without muddle, minor scaffold in repetitive stems purposeful for voice; no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc solitude via glassblower's theatrical narration transforms tropes; risk-taking in self-narration heightens stakes, bookmark turn inevitable from priors, bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
