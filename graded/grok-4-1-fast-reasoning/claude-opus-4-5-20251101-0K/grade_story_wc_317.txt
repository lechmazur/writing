<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between retirement temptation and innovative persistence act in reflections on the seed and buyout; final planting/sketching renunciation earned by prior business philosophy with cost of long-term patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as seed/brook reflections densify to CR closure in planting and sketching; legible cost of un-rushable commitment crystallized in "seven years of silence within its shell."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook's "eternal flow" and "ancient stones" constrain orthogonal philosophy and charge final moonlit image/planting; sensory hush post-storm mirrors internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seed insight deepens dominant stake of resisting buyout under accumulative lens, narrowing to non-linear room; cost of rejecting wealth for patience felt but remains somewhat abstract until planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final sketching reconfigures innovation as "protecting the darkness" via seed/brook particulars, resonating non-literally without moralizing; corpse flower reprise shifts premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward signs/symbols, with rhythmic modulation from charged opening to poised closure; stable close-third POV enhances symbolic intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates motif recurrence without loops; minor opening metaphor density ("pregnant with possibility") purposeful for textural lens but risks slight overwrites pre-escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orthogonal "Corpse Flower" room transforms escape genre tropes via botany/business synthesis; non-conquest design risks boldly, heightening stakes inevitably from seed premise.</comment>
