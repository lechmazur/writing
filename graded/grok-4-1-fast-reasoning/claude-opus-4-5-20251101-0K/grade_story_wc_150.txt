<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's skepticism clashes with growing pull in discoveries like tokens and sundial, yielding earned shift to restoration via concrete choices like rebuilding gnomon; contradictory impulses act in scene, final carrying seeds forecloses doubt path with personal cost. Internal voice particular, no stock epiphanies. Embodiment shines in "breath caught... warmly curious wonder."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries densify to sundial realization and gnomon rebuild as CR, reweighting faith with cost of completing abandoned path; oriented early via descent/map, one tightening via glow shifts options. No shards/orientation debt. Final image ("growing light from bone") pays off pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Orchard's bone-threaded roots and pale apples constrain wandering/discoveries, charge closure glow; sensory hierarchy (soil/sweetness, glowing shadows) filters via Mira's excavation bias. Recurrent tokens/roots mirror internal shift tactilely. Sundial clearing as micro-setting forces pivotal kneel/understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disprove vs. restore faith) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tokens/sundial to rebuild agency; gnomon placement forecloses skepticism, glow crystallizes cost in deepened devotion. One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of faith generating light in darkness emerges via orchard/sundial particulars, reweighted in glow and seeds-carried exit without moralizing; final image answers interruption via continuation, resonant non-literal CR. Subtext in tokens/family history layers complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third, perceptual signature (skeptic to enchanted noticing) biases details like "roots threading skulls"; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, diction controlled (e.g., "patient fingers"). No head-hopping/elision issues; voice as character in "cautious enchantment."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm (short wonder breaths amid flowing discovery); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (roots as "patient fingers" pay off in glow). Closure image crisp, zero scaffold; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underground bone-orchard transforms descent trope into faith-as-time generator, sundial ingenuity fresh; synthesis of diaspora skepticism and glowing revival inevitable from particulars, bold risk in impossible setting heightens stakes organically.</comment>
