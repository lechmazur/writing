<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fleeing academic isolation vs. embracing shared pilgrimage) act in scene through feather-sharing micro-choice; final softening of self earned by prior causal work with relational cost felt in memorized coordinates. Voice distinct in Marina's astrologer lens vs. Theo's empirical idiom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via shared observation to Charged Poise closure in merged breath fog ("twin clouds that merged and faded"); cost legible in reweighted prior exile, constraint of facility isolation shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent walls and groaning facility constrain intimate sharing, charge final fish ascent; recurring "shadowseam wonder" mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism, sensory hierarchy (light over sound) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging vs. isolation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to shared exhale crystallizing connection; agency in sustained attention forecloses solitude path, cost in "edges of herself softening" unmistakable but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging in luminous pauses emerges organically from fish patterns and exhale image reweighting isolation; resonant non-literal answer in "rhythm... grew in the pause between lights" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Marina POV with perceptual signature (celestial-terrain lens); dialogue subtextual ("refugee from the symposium?") advances stakes, rhythmic control modulates to quiet intensity at fish emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figurative pattern ("shadowseam wonder," "liquid aurora"); minor deduction for dense metaphors in climax beat ("choreography written in living light") bordering overwrite without obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of landscape astrology and bioluminescent fish-stellar mapping transforms isolation trope; risk in poetic underwater lyric heightens stakes, inevitable exhale from established pauses.</comment>
