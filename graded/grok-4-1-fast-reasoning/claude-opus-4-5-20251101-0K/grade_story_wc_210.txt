<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "opening isn't the answer" versus communion attempt, earning the transformative choice; interiority embodied via bottle's warmth and memory flood. Final crafting forecloses destructive paths with solitude's visible cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like exile balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to CR closure in lantern crafting and returns, reweighting dependency with conceptual cost of self-reliance. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; one tightening via wish reinterpretation narrows options. Cost legible in "beneath the convenient crutch."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lanterns as recurrent object constrain choices (new crystallized versions from memories) and charge final image ("lanterns swayed, and this time, they held light"). Sensory selection urgent (warm bottle, flooding light); setting mirrors shift from hollow to blazing. No white-room; lived-in via tea house/shrine passes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive without magic) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via memory flood forcing reconception; agency in non-destructive communion/crafting forecloses restoration. Cost felt in ongoing exile and crutch release. One tightening reweights knowledge without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over preservation emerges organically via sealed bottle shared and ordinary-joy lanterns, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fisherman's true wish; invites ambiguity on resilience's price. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical bias: "distilled memories," "crystallized intention"); rhythm modulates from murmur to blaze. Diction purposeful, no leakage; compression taught early in bottle paradox. Voice distinct without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances insight/action; varied rhythm peaks in "memories flooded like light through paper." No loops/artifacts; opening anchors stakes, ending recharges lanterns. Figuratives coherent, no overwriting in closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: no-opening bottle and intention-lanterns transform ghost-town trope via alchemical memory logic; risk in solo civilization-reimagining pays off in CR. Non-obvious wish reinterpretation inevitable in hindsight; bold conceptual premise commits fully.</comment>
