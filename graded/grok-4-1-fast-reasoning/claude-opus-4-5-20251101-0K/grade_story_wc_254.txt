<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in doubt turning to certainty via quartz interaction; micro-choices like paraphrasing reveal values under aesthetic drive. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal reading beat slightly limits 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to quartz glow and ice crack as Charged Poise RR; closure cost legible in "boundary keepers felt their certainties tremble" final line. Orientation anchored early in atrium entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (quartz hum through body, ice reflection) filter through poetic POV and constrain choices; recurring quartz charges final awakening image perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving word-power signaled early, deepens accumulatively via quartz response and crack; agency in reading forecloses doubt with felt pulse-sync cost, but subtle external price tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-crossing emerges organically from poetry awakening place; final moths/lake image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting sacred as approachable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (shadows drifting, hum as thought); stable close-third POV modulates rhythmically to heighten certainty without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful metaphors (dissolving boundaries) cohere without muddle, minor lyric density in reflection beats doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic awakening in humming crystals and boundary-dissolving fantasy; risk-taking in lyric accumulation feels inevitable, transforming tropes via specific atrium logic.</comment>
