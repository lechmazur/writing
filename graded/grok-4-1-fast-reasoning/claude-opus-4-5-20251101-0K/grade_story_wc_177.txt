<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in phantom lives (Helsinki surgeon vs. Morocco bones) and final renunciation of mastery is earned by scientists' visions with felt cost of carrying their failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with vision density tightening to CR closure ("she would not try to master the paths"); cost legible in "carrying broken proof" and new sky image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungus and vines constrain choices (tighten around bunker) and charge final image (forest changed, storm parts); body/setting mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand paths) deepens via seal-break flood under accumulative lens, narrowing to renunciation; cost felt in foreclosed transcendence, charging poise image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (new sky, "love uncertainty") offers resonant non-literal answer to mastery theme, reweighting scientists' arrogance through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vision filters ("phantom timelines... invitations"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in seal-break flood with stable limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Dreams flooded her waking mind"); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figures like "hungry... for the sea" integrate without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alive paths needing witnesses transforms fate tropes; risk in CR closure ("future... only because she had chosen to let it choose her") heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
