<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied tapping habit from childhood concretely links past silences to present data rhythms, compelling transmission choice with grief cost; interior conflict in rationing journals layers contradictory impulses without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as evidence density builds to CR closure via transmission; grandmother's "They won't tell you what's underneath" note pivots causality, with legible cost in irreplaceable losses; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's pontoons and swaying constrain solitary assembly, mirroring internal drift; "ocean continued its patient breathing" charges final image, with sensory selection (paper texture, vent's breath) reflecting POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of path disappearance tightens via coordinate match, foreclosing climate-only view and forcing transmission agency; cost felt in "knelt on dying reefs... wept into her mask," reweighting under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Human-drawn poison paths emerge implicitly from evidence overlay, answered non-literally by fluttering atlas and grandmother's "truth... surfaces when the tides shift"; complexity in unresolvable guilt avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in data-as-screams and rhythm-biased noticing; diction modulates lyrically under revelation pressure without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in "correlation was devastating and precise" propels without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully, metaphors cohere (sediment into stone), no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poisoned routes reconfiguring climate grief via grandmother's maps transforms eco-trope with specific guilt calculus; quiet CR risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
