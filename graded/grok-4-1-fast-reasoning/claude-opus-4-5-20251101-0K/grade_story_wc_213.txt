<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's humble expertise and motivation to prioritize listening shine through concrete actions like tracing the rope and tracking data; internal shift from siren calibration to bell pull feels earned with embodied patience. Minor telling in backstory summaries slightly flattens contradictory impulses in the climax pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds patiently to Charged Poise closure when Mira pulls the rope amid converging instruments, reconfiguring warnings into acknowledgment with atmospheric equilibrium cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary and microclimate details constrain choices, filtering through Mira's sensory priorities; final data response to bell vibration charges the image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mastering listening tightens via solstice convergence and glue-dried rope, forcing agency in the pull; cost of career inversion felt in imagined valley pause, though escalation leans textural over sharp reversal.</comment>
