<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation from inherited shame drives concrete micro-choices like gripping the lattice and naming the entity, with embodied fear ("breath caught") contradicting resolve. Internal conflict over family legacy acts in scene, earning the belief-act closure. Final trembling shows earned cost without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (scratches, letters) build density to cadence-shifting shatter via lattice belief. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse prison, Milo's arrival). On-page DC (hush-thing shatters) with cost (cracked lattice, trembling) reconfigures disbelief premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens crisis: "absence of sound so profound it pressed against his eardrums," light "honey-slow." Lattice as micro-setting constrains climax choice, charges final cracked image. Atmosphere mirrors internal hush with purposeful selectivity, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gain belief against disbelief-feeder) signaled early, deepens via scratches revelation narrowing to belief-act. Agency in holding lattice/speaking forecloses silence-path with legible cost (shatter's "sound like breaking waves"). Escalation accumulates under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of witness-needed truth emerges via fable inversion and hush-feeder; subtext in "for beings that feed on silence, nothing burns like being heard." Final "copperlight settle around him like absolution" reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing, complexity in inherited doubt lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: notices father's scratches through character bias. Voice texture poetic yet biased ("chasing hush"), modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences at hover). Whisper dialogue natural/subtextual, advances goal without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "copperlight seemed to thicken" advances atmosphere/causality). Varied rhythm propels to shatter; no loops, purposeful "copperlight" recurrence. Zero artifacts in peak: clean propulsion, strong verbs embody stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh hush-entity synthesis transforms "cry wolf" trope via disbelief-feeding logic, lattice as belief-weapon ingenious. Risky supernatural pivot in prison feels inevitable from letters buildup. Bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
