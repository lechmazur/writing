<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied (cold seeping in), with micro-choices under pressure (pushing deeper into dreams) revealing values; final exposure decision earned by psychic residue and patterns. Minor label ("weaves truth carefully") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. absolution) act in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream density builds to harbormaster revelation, tightening knowledge with CR closure ("Elise Varnum, at last, stepped through") and conceptual cost (two-way passage). Orientation anchored early (shrine, globe); one meaningful deepening suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and warped globe constrain choices (ice as veil-thinning window) and charge final image (warm globe in cold, stars filtered through ice). Sensory hierarchy (amber shadows, crystallizing breath) reflects Mira's psychic priorities; evolves causally (candles gutter).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve haunting via truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through dream patterns to sabotage reveal, narrowing options (expose or not) with agency (Mira traces/decides). Felt cost legible in "knife" decision and two-way window risk. One tightening charges closure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection/haunting emerges organically from dream margins and ice-window motif, reweighted non-literally in final image (Elise steps through) without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (snow globe residue); invites ambiguity (absolution vs. theft).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (psychic photographs shuffled); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in revelations). Lyrical diction purposeful and legible; no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, propulsion via varied rhythm (e.g., "The truth was a knife" pivots beat). Figuratives coherent/selective; no scaffold, overwriting, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost whisperer via dream cameos/ice memory transforms tropes; risk-taking in psychic accumulative drive heightens stakes. Non-obvious CR (two-way window) inevitable from particulars.</comment>
