<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find meaning drives concrete micro-choices like placing the tile flake at the mandala's center, earning her shift from unease to tears; old man's fear softens via her perception, revealing relational crucible. Social perceptiveness shown through reading sand patterns and his resistance, not just labeled. Minor flaw: early "socially perceptive" tell slightly unearned before demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers and mandala builds to CR closure where voice reprices hush as invitation, with tears as felt cost in "channels through the dust on her cheeks." Orientation anchored early in grotto/unlearning. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustics constrain whispers toward mandala, charging closure hum; mist and flaking tiles tactilely mirror unlearning, filtering through Mira's priorities. Tile flake as micro-setting evolves from mother's voice to center, indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning vs. becoming hush) signaled early, tightens via mandala concentrating whispers into coherent voice, narrowing to realization with agency in her persistent building. Cost legible in trembling fingers and tears; old man's opposition adds coherent pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hush as space for authentic meaning emerges organically from mandala's logic and voice's color-speech, reweighting noise as clutter without direct statement. Final drawing offers resonant non-literal answer; minor echo in "meaning was the mess itself" but earned through pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in color-stained senses and spiral geometries; voice lilac-poetic modulates to charged closure. Dialogue subtextual—old man's "become" vs. her "listening differently"—distinct from narration, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, e.g., short hum sentence into voice emergence; no loops, though "whispers" purposeful accumulation. Minor overwriting in "geometries that spoke in a language older than words" but voice-motivated, clear at closure mandala breathing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of apocalyptic hush with mandala acoustics transforms silence trope into invitation CR; risk in poetic compression pays off in inevitable tile/voice payoff, no derivative echoes.</comment>
