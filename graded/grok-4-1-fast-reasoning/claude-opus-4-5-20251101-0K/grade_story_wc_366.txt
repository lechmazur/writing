<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's reticence breaks credibly in the spoken promise and letter-writing, earned by embodied reading of letters and cairn study; interior contradiction between silence and yearning feels simultaneous in the lantern room. Minor reflection on chain history anchors to present cues without flattening pressure. Final micro-choice hierarchy (voice over silence) reveals values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from arrival through cairn realization to letter-reading RR/Charged Poise closure; cost legible in her voice-breaking commitment ("I'll protect it") that forecloses silence. One tightening via cairn message narrows options purposefully. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern room's fractured prisms, rust, nest constrain ascent and charge final glow image; sea glass/stones recur tactilely, mirroring internal states via POV-filtered observation. Sensory hierarchy (silence, dust motes) reflects urgency; micro-setting (lamp base cairn) enables choices. Environment shapes closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chain/presence protection) signaled early, Accumulative deepening via letters reweights with yearning pressure; agency in cairn rebuild/letter addition forecloses abandonment. Cost felt in ache and voice-use; one cadence shift suffices. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of passed-on safety emerges organically from letters, stones, glow—final image reconfigures "lights never go out" without moralizing, reweighting silence/cargo. Subtext in yearning presence invites ambiguity; resonance from particulars like widow's letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with observant perceptual signature (cataloging rust/nest); rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise. Single spoken line natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping, elision purposeful (ghost felt via cues).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid lyric swells); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks—peak beats clean. Figuratives purposeful (dust motes like creatures) without muddle; propulsion weaves detail into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost trope via stone-language chain transforms abandonment into luminous legacy; cairn evolution feels inevitable from particulars. Risks quiet closure effectively; no template echoes.</comment>
