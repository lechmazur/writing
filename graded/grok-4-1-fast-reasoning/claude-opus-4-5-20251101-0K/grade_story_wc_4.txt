<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to heal via photographs is consistent and intensifies through examples like Viktor's weeping/laughing; interiority concrete in her belief about arcs. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene reduce from 9+; calm competence dominates without much embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from spring project to autumn gatherings to anniversary mosaic as RR/Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of reshaped grief legible in "people before it, finally reaching." Orientation anchored early; time progression causal under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Factory ruins, lavender field, vines constrain and charge final image (vines "doing their own quiet work," swaying at gathering); sensory selective (purple persistence, corroded skeleton). Mirrors healing without overt symbolism; spatial coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of village healing signaled early, tightens accumulatively via examples (Viktor, Mrs. Castellan) to mosaic; agency in Maren's invitations forecloses isolation path. Cost felt in fractured "silence" reconfiguration; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-cartography emerges via arcs connecting hearts, resonant in mosaic as non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like stolen bread gesture layer complexity; final reserved photo invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (arcs as real story); lyrical rhythm modulates from calm exposition to charged ending. No dialogue; compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short sentences in examples propel); "arcs" recurs patterned without loop. Minor elevated diction in reflective blocks ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") borders overwriting but serves voice; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of photo arcs as healing threads transforms grief trope organically; fresh synthesis in mosaic gesture feels inevitable. Vines/lavender risk bold environmental agency heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
