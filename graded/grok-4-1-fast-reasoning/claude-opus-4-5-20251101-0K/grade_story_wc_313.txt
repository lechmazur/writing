<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (heroic father vs. abandoner) act in scene via photo discoveries, culminating in earned laughter and aloud admission; final renunciation of control carries visible emotional cost in tears and speech. Interiority particular and embodied without diagnostic labels. Reflection anchors tightly to concrete cues like photos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as photo trail densifies revelations to CR closure: final Chicago photo reconfigures narrative with undeniable emotional cost in "the tears she finally allowed." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via station discovery suffices. Pattern taught implicitly from first photo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resurfacing town and dripping ruins constrain trail of discoveries and charge final image of "empty streets... ready to speak"; sensory hierarchy (drips as percussion, violet sky) reflects urgent emergence. Micro-setting (boulder, ridge highest point) guides reflective choices. No white-room; evolved causally with light fading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. constructed narrative) signaled early, tightens via final photo narrowing heroic illusion; agency in gathering photos for sharing forecloses suppression path with legible cost in self-laughter and tears. Pressure coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of illusory control emerges organically from particulars (photos, resurfacing town) to resonant CR: "control was an illusion" reweights premise via shared meaning choice, embracing complication without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer lingering in ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (liminal violet, mirrored silences); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to compressed in peak realization ("He left"). Lyrical diction purposeful and character-biased, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short declarative peaks like "He left"); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (mirrored motifs), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Propulsion clear, overwriting absent in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resurfacing town as memory-revealer transforms abandonment trope via levee warden's narrative guard; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes, feels inevitable from photo trail. Bold voice commits fully without hedging.</comment>
