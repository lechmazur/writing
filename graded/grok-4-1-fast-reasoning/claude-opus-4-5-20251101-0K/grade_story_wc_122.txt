<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deaf teacher's motivation roots in fear of unshared music, embodied in vibrations surfacing contradictory memories of mother/husband/student; final tears and endurance of pain earn thaw without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds vibration density to RR closure where "first crack had formed in its armor" lands with painful/glorious cost; single scene holds lens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drum-lined cavern and oak drum constrain hands-on ritual; needle's "crystalline shard" fractures light, charging pocketed final image with broken beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of numbness tightens via protagonist-clutched needle amplifying drums, forcing memory confrontation; tears mark agency-driven cost, reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Filament hush reconfigures silence from void to "potential, the pause between heartbeats"; leaf rustle answers premise non-literally, emerging organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third deaf POV signatures vibration over sound—"thrumming up through her bones"—with rhythmic modulation; signed dialogue subtextual, voice-distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density prose varies rhythm without loops; purposeful hush/reversal motifs propel, though "light through water" borders overwrought in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backward hush-filament via deaf teacher's needle ritual transforms silence tropes boldly; synthesis feels inevitable in "broken things can still translate beauty."</comment>
