<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in nearly leaving the bag but hauling it up earn the ribbon-passing choice with relational cost; Mira and Petra's distinct voices and embodied grief (ribbon faded to fog) distinguish them without stereotypes. Petra's feistiness forces Mira's laughter, revealing hierarchy of values. Final micro-choice hierarchizes persistence over loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: climbing/discovery density reconfigures loss into renewal, with CR closure in ribbon handoff and orchard rustle making before/after legible via felt legacy cost. Bag opening tightens one beat; no orientation debt, single scene coherent. Cost proof: "Your mother would have wanted you to have this" forecloses Mira's solo grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard roots in dust constrain climbing while glowing apples charge final persistence image, mirroring renewal; sensory hierarchy (amber light on quartz eye) filters via Mira's mender bias. Cathedral-rafter sprawl evolves with action (branches wedged), tactile and purposeful. No white-room; micro-setting (rafters) guides choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge wisdom post-guild fall) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bag reveal narrowing to teaching Petra; fuzzy eye adds personal pressure. Ribbon renunciation forecloses isolation with emotional cost on page. Agency coherent under lens; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Deciduous vows emerge implicitly from bag/ribbon/orchard particulars, reweighting breach into persistence without statement; final image ("spring always returned, and so would they") offers non-literal answer via CR. No moralizing; ambiguity in "vows would fall again" embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (quartz eye whirs, notices ribbon fog); dialogue subtextual ("Respect your elders" evades slowness), distinct rhythms (Petra's sharp retorts). Rhythmic prose modulates with laughs/climbs; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "apple trees rooted in centuries of accumulated dust" advances setting/atmosphere/character); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Vivid propulsion in peak bag-opening; zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz-eye menders in rafter orchard transforms guild-loss trope into fresh synthesis of decay/renewal; risk in impossible setting heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via bag's "accidental wisdom"; no derivatives.</comment>
