<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sensory-specific interiority and micro-choices under time pressure reveal a consistent artisan trait rooted in sharpened perception, earning her endurance at closure. Minimal internal contradiction limits perfection; no raw flaws complicate her calm competence. Merchant's brief pressure tests her method without deep relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repair density builds to Charged Poise closure in final image of mist as "second sight," reweighting her purpose with ongoing damage cost legible in "world... full of damage." Orientation anchors instantly; single scene tightens meaningfully via bells without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and rail depot constrain drone stakes (fog navigation) and charge final image, evolving from threat to affirming "second sight." Tactile workbench details (brass basin, tools by texture) mirror her blind priorities, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone fix before noon) signaled early; time bells deepen pressure accumulatively, forcing deliberate pace trade-off with felt cost in potential voyage delay. Agency in methodical repair forecloses rush path; minor external conflict via merchant coheres without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decoding wholeness from damage emerges via repair particulars, resonating in final CR image without moralizing—"her magnetic calm in a world that moved too fast to notice its own fractures" reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind perceptual signature (heat patterns, vibrations as "kiss") biases diction distinctively; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with pressure, minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; voice texture purposeful in sensory compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via embodied specifics; minor "feeling" stem repetition purposeful in sensory motif, no loops dulling closure. Figurative restraint (mist "like breath... god") coherent, no artifacts in peak repair beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh blind artisan angle transforms repair trope via unique sensory diagnostics; mist-drone synthesis and calm endurance amid fractures feel inevitable, risking quiet closure payoff without gimmick.</comment>
