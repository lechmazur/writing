<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meren's contradictory impulses—evading her curse yet compelled by grandmother's promise—act in scene via rock placement and star dust use, earning her final stance shift with visible cost in repurposed curse. Interiority concrete and embodied in "blur her inner eye" and sure grip on slick ground. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rock spiral triggers vision, star dust deepens uncorrupted insight, eels enable reversal—density tightens to Charged Poise closure where Meren begins harnessing patterns. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph. On-page cost legible in "curse finally serving creation instead of calamity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora, slick tidal bluff, and painted rocks constrain choices (grip ropes implied, sure stance despite slickness) and charge final image ("aurora sang... eels began to dance"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: patterns over generics. Environment evolves causally with auroral shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore friction via understanding) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vision's dark reversal then star dust-enabled solution narrowing to eel pattern. Agency in pouring dust and standing to harness forecloses evasion path. Cost felt in promised burden accepted; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of observation as creation vs undoing emerges organically from visions cementing futures, resolved non-literally in eels dancing patterns. Final image reweights curse/premise without moral. Complexity in promise haunting evasion; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: nautilus math, eel formations as innate patterns. Voice rhythmic and biased ("silk torn from dying stars," "thoughts through a dreaming mind"). Prose modulates intensity purposefully; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "seventeenth stone... vision struck" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language pattern-taught via rocks/pigments, coherent in peak vision beat. Propulsion peaks at "solution emerged like tide revealing stone."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frictionless world + precog curse + geometric eels transforms tropes inevitably; backward patterns as villainy risks bold world logic fully committed to closure. No derivatives; eel dance reconfigures premise uniquely.</comment>
