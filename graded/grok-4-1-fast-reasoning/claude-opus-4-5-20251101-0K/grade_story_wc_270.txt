<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in Mira's preservation drive, shown through embodied actions like descending into the hot water despite arthritis; contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. guardianship) act in her singing choice, earning the closure retrieval with physical cost. Final realization of implanted destiny feels character-particular, not epiphanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from plant whispers to kite decoding to song, culminating in on-page RR (glass shatters, embryo retrieved) with legible cost (her immersion and arthritic embrace of heat). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent, no shards needed. Kite summary integrates without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain choices (steam hides her at dawn, heat tests body) and charge final image (bubbling song as she emerges with amber); sensory hierarchy (sulfur, ferns' memories) filtered through Mira's plant-biased POV. Micro-setting (vine, moss) guides fingers, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve heritage vs. reconstruction) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via plant-guided decoding to song under lens; agency in singing forecloses path with on-page cost (physical plunge into steaming water). One deepening suffices; crews' daily incursions add situational pressure without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unbroken living memory emerges organically from plant guidance and embryo retrieval, resonating in final image ("plants would remember... no regime could destroy") without moralizing; subtext in vine's "approval curl" reweights tradition-evolution tension non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (plant "whispers"); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to charged ("She sang") under stress, no head-hopping. Lyrical diction purposeful and legible, fitting Mira's singer past.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm (short peak sentences like "She sang."); minor plant-repetition purposeful for texture, no loops dulling closure; sensory integration propels without overwriting in climax water descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, kite-script song, and amber embryo transforms tropes (sacred artifact quest) through grounded volcanic logic and Mira's traits; risk in lyric plant-voice heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "implanted destiny" realization.</comment>
