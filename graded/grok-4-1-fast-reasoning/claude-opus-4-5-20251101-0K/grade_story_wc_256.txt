<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's synesthetic perception of harmonics as colors and her micro-choices in listening stations reveal contradictory impulses; final shift to ringing bells without expectation is earned by accumulated realizations with emotional cost in weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pilgrimage stations building to CR in "perfect silence" realization, reweighting connection as attention with cost of uncomfortable transformation; two-shard structure (lab to tower) tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carbide lens as micro-setting constrains hearing choices across stations and charges final image around her neck; lab equipment like phonograph horns integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking connection's texture deepens texturally through stations, with agency in focused listening; cost legible in "rough, uncomfortable, transformative" realization shown via weeping at wind recording.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection as sending signals without response emerges from recording particulars to final bell image, offering non-literal CR that reweights assumptions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("harmonics that painted the air with color") and rhythmic prose modulate with realization intensity; stable close-third POV suits lyric accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels stations; purposeful metaphors like "prismatic harmonics cascading outward" enhance closure image without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringer in "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" offers fresh textural pilgrimage synthesizing sound, light, and connection into inevitable CR; risk in lyric structure heightens resonance.</comment>
