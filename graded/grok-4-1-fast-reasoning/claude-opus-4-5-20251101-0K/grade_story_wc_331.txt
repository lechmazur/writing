<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via scarf's sensory details (oil/lavender, warmth) reveals particular motivation tied to grandmother; earned endurance in ongoing search shows contradictory impulses of belief vs. impossibility acting in the aisle walk; micro-choices like tugging frayed edges under pressure hierarchize values without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from patrons' observations to geometry shift ("parallel lines meeting") and room discovery; on-page CR closure reconfigures search via scarf-map realization with conceptual cost of perpetual cataloging; orientation anchored early in odd hours/schedule; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library's hyperbolic curves constrain aisle path and trigger reawakening, charging final notebook annotation; scarf as micro-setting recurs tactilely (trailing spines, throat warmth), mirroring internal shift; sensory hierarchy (humming in teeth) reflects POV urgency without visual overreliance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stories' place) signaled early via grandmother's notes, tightens accumulatively through instinct-led walk yielding room access; agency in turning nonexistent corner forecloses ordinary space with endurance cost of returning to desk/work; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge's solitary vastness emerges organically from patrons' "private universes" contrasting hyperbolic room; final image of annotating notebook offers non-literal resonance on science-poetry fusion without moralizing; complexity lingers in "wonderfully, understood" solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (geometric "wrongness," voices in teeth) stable in third-person limited POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in shift ("cylinders started spinning"); purposeful compression of awakenings legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., scarf trails spines while noting curves); varied rhythm/read-aloud flow in awakening beat avoids monotony; no loops, artifacts, or overwriting—figuratives like "grooves pressed into wax" integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism via hyperbolic library/architecture for stories-as-geometry; risk of "room that was also a garden/sky" heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight synthesis of science-poetry in dodecahedron voice.</comment>
