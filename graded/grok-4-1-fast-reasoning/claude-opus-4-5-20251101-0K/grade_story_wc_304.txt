<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority rooted in Mira's vocation, with lucid watchfulness embodied in studying static like death photos; micro-choices like lifting the chip reveal values under fading pressure. Contradictory impulses in recognizing the diminishing rhythm compel the infusing with felt cost. Final endurance as bridge-bearer earned by causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns pulse from static to rhythm to infusion, tightening density to Charged Poise closure where emerald blazes and grotto dissolves. On-page cost legible in "minutes before oblivion claimed what remained." Single scene, orientation anchored early, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (aurora veins on ice, crackling static) filters through Mira's priorities, constraining access to liminal threshold. Grotto's dissolution charges final descent image, mirroring internal capture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via emerging rhythm and intensifying blaze that narrows to infusion decision. Agency in pressing chip forecloses dissipation path with on-page time cost; pressure coheres to reweight work's sacredness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty preserving endings emerges organically from emerald infusion and pulsing reprise, offering non-literal answer to threshold-crossing without moralizing. Final image recharges mother's rhythm motif with conceptual cost of fading souls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in rhythm-pattern bias; lyrical syntax modulates from watchful scan to blazing peak. Purposeful compression in static emergence taught early, paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion, varying syntax mirroring intensity (shortened at blaze: "warmed... burned... blazed"); no loops or artifacts dull peak infusion. Figuratives like "gossamer boundary" purposeful, voice-integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician craft with auroral soul-capture transforms liminal tropes via emerald's irreplaceable frequency. Risky skyborne grotto payoff feels inevitable from dream setup, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
