<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in embodied grief (voice cracked, tears) drives micro-choices like presenting the clock and staying; Yua's precision forces relational shift. Internal conflict between clinging and release acts in scene via listening and acceptance. Minor label-speak in "luminous ache" slightly abstracts peak emotion but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from clock presentation to leaf frequency fixing it, culminating in RR (clock stops, pointing to moon) with legible emotional cost in Mira's restructured ache. Orientation anchored early (observatory, sage). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity; closure image reconfigures loss into peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory, tremors, silver tree, and moonlight constrain actions (steady instruments, catch leaf) and charge final image (clock points to moon). Sensory selection (whispered leaf sound) reflects urgency; POV bias filters through Mira's loss. Micro-setting (pale tree) enables pivotal fix.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve endless clock/loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Yua's diagnosis and leaf method, narrowing to release with felt cost (grief shift). Tremors escalate pressure coherently. Protagonist agency in presenting clock and choosing to stay forecloses clinging path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of release over capture emerges organically from clock spin → leaf stop and father's "escape velocity," reweighting ephemeral in final image without statement. Subtext in Yua's metaphors invites ambiguity on loss. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; closure answers via honored release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (starlight, mist through Mira's climb/loss); voice rhythmic and selective. Dialogue subtextual (Yua's "by the sound of a leaf falling" advances goal indirectly). Distinct idioms: Yua sage-like, Mira vulnerable; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short tremor sentences amid poetic flow); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. "Spinning cast fractured shadows" exemplifies purposeful figurative layering without overwriting in peak fix beat. Read-aloud ear strong, clarity intact at leaf fall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics (escape velocity) and metaphysics (leaf frequency) transforms grief trope into ingenious fix; leaf-as-sound irreplaceable for closure. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; particular observatory logic feels inevitable.</comment>
