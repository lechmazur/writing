<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief (calloused fingers on telescope) roots motivation from isolation to teaching; contradictory impulses in craft hollowing vs. reconstructing earn final change. Minor therapy-speak in "curtains of intention" diagnostic feel slightly unearned mid-reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from numbness to community via cranes, closure as Charged Poise in dome realization ("carry it forward into making") with felt cost of enduring grief. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via mourner growth suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Timeless observatory constrains (no clocks suspending time) and charges final image (starlight through dome); selective sensory (twilight dust motes, brass mount) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief curtains vs. intention to live) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crane-folding to teaching; cost legible in "no longer shattered" endurance foreclosing numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured healing ("genuinely artificial") emerges organically from stencil-to-cranes particulars; final image ("curtains parted again") resonates non-literally, reweighting grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with grief-specific perceptual bias (stars irrelevant to loss); rhythmic prose modulates from hollow to illuminating, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid flowing reflections); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("chrysanthemum unfurling"). Minor purple risk in "subdued ardor" but voice-integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning craft, celestial stencil-map, coordinate-cranes transforms grief tropes organically; risk in timeless healing community heightens stakes authentically.</comment>
