<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied fear ("heart stammering") and contradictory liberation in blindness driving micro-choices; final smile renunciation of foresight earned by prior uncertainty, foreclosing prophetic life with felt cost. Blind spots compound authentically before CR closure. Minor reflective summary in backstory but anchored to present descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to pearl grasp where visions deliver CR closure, reweighting premise with cost of missed past miracles legible in "She had spent her life chasing the extraordinary." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (humming frequencies felt over heard) integrates via POV bias, constraining climax as shadows "pool in corners" and "surge." Cave pearl alcove and dawn final image charge closure; micro-setting (pearl) reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore vision via pearl) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through shadow merger and song-language shift narrowing to grasp; agency in reaching despite surge, cost in overwhelming present-visions foreclosing future-focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of everyday magic emerges organically from pearl-visions ("child laughing at a butterfly") reweighting prophetic premise; final dawn image offers non-literal answer without moralizing, resonant with ambiguity of unseen approval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (magic as "wind through wheat"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture apt for accumulative lens, elision of foresight paid in present immersion; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (singing cave taught early, pays off in "sang her home"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; minor density of metaphors in descent but coherent for textural drive, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant quest inverts to present-epiphany via "crystallized moonlight," transforming cave-trope into textural CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, no derivative hedging.</comment>
