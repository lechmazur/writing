<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's hesitation before approaching and lens exchange reveal contradictory solitude-vulnerability impulses acting in scene; final doodle addition earned by prior observation, with cost of forfeited distance legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of observations tightens to resonant object exchange; closure Charged Poise reconfigures isolation with emotional cost in "giving away a piece of her carefully constructed distance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal acoustics constrain Mira's eavesdropping choice and amplify closure exchange in "whispered it back in fractured harmonics," charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of thawing wordless mistrust deepens accumulatively through spotting, eavesdropping, and exchange, narrowing isolation with vulnerability cost in shoulders loosening and added doodle figure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final dual figures stepping through door reweights premise of obsolete language with presence-as-truth, emerging organically from doodles and lens without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature via lens distortion sustains biased, lyrical noticing; rhythmic control modulates from ambiguous observation to crisp closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops or muddled figures; varied rhythm peaks clearly in exchange beat, sustaining momentum to resonant hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-language premise fresh via artifact communication (doodles, lens), transforming silence trope; risk of wordless climax heightens stakes through earned, inevitable exchange.</comment>
