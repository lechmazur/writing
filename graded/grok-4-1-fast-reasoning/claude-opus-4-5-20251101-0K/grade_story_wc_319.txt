<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional feral guardian with embodied contradiction—frozen veins vs. unlocked ache from weeping—earned in micro-choices like picking up pendant; final invitation forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue. Minor reflection block anchors cleanly to present cue without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to charged poise in final sitting image, reconfiguring waiting with legible emotional cost ("I want to remember what it feels like to not wait alone"). Single scene, orientation anchored by para 2; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden/mist constrains Maren's feral stasis and charges final image of mist-breathing as welcoming; sensory hierarchy (no breath fog, glittering roses) mirrors internal thaw. Micro-setting (crystallized fountain, ice-locked books) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) signaled early, tightens via weeping unlocking Maren's stasis; agency in invitation narrows options with relational cost under textural lens. One deepening sufficient; cost felt in surprise at her own words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of home-as-relationship emerges organically from pendant exchange and final image; resonant non-literal answer reweights "boundaries of light" without moralizing. Complexity in "giving up and letting go wear different faces" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (frost-wild hair, whispering books); voice modulates poetically yet lucidly under pressure. Dialogue goal-driven with subtext ("Home is a flexible concept here"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to charged closure; purposeful lyric metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening ("mist like a sleeping beast") risks slight overwrite but serves textural lens without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of limbo-guardian trope via "interiorizing exteriors" into feral adaptation; risk-taking in foggy-lucid tone heightens emotional stakes, transforming isolation into connection inevitability.</comment>
