<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Erasmus's traits shine through concrete actions like Sumerian speech to birds and seed release, rooting motivation in patient observation; endurance of ritual earns closure. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the ritual beat, idealizing competence without peak internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of observations and bird exchanges builds to CR closure in final image of coachman on blooming jetty, reweighting death-to-growth with conceptual cost of time/decay; orientation anchors instantly in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flowers and luminous water constrain ritual timing and charge final image, filtering through Erasmus's biased attention to currents/chemistry; tactile details like wrinkled vetch pods integrate seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of battlefield reclamation escalates accumulatively via bird intel on tides/reef nutrients, culminating in seed release that crystallizes endurance; cost legible in "decades" and personal decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of death-fueled resurrection emerges organically from reef dissolution to headland shoots, resonant in final heron exchange without moralizing; CR reweights war's scars via interspecies concord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (ancient tongues, natural cycles) modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person focalization biased to bird calls and sea chemistry enhances lyric poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory integration; purposeful repetition of birds/seeds accumulates texture without loops, climaxing in clean "narrow vastness" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of post-war desolation, avian linguistics, and oceanic alchemy transforms tropes; bird-mediated ritual feels inevitable, risking bold conceptual concord payoff.</comment>
