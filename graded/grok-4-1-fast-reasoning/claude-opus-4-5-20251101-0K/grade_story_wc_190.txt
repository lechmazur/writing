<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via sound expertise and embodied grief (e.g., vial in weathered hand); motivation intensifies through helix pattern compelling vial's release; final renunciation of crystals earns stasis with emotional cost, balancing competence and loss without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to vial's dissolution (RR/Charged Poise); orientation anchored in first paragraph (Eris, gondola over prism terrace post-whistle); closure reconfiguration legible with conceptual cost in transformed silence, helix cue tightening options precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant via POV bias constrains navigation (cable thrums, echo pockets); drifting terrace guides choices (platform convergence) and charges final image (new quiet drifting below); selective details like auroral glow mirror internal hush without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comforting silence) signaled early, deepens via unprecedented helix forcing catalytic release; agency in opening vial forecloses memory preservation with felt price; accumulative cadence shift reweights terrace under coherent pressure, though external stakes subtly internalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-receiving silence emerges via particulars (vial dissolution, echo pockets); final image ("gift waiting to be opened") non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting absence into method; resonance from embodied struggle avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from thrum tension to hush release; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration (e.g., "dust made of light"); minor figurative density in opening teaches pattern paying off at helix/closure without muddle or loops; propulsion clear, no scaffolds dulling peak vial beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic grief in crystalline world (harmonic storms, sound-monitored terraces) transforms tropes organically; helix vial act inevitable from sound stakes; risk in lyric hush heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
