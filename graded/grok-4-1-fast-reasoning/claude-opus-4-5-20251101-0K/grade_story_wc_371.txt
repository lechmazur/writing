<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment (fingers on cup, breaking stale bread) and contradictory impulses (past rage yielding to learned gentleness), earning the renunciation of fury with visible cost in patient observation; micro-choices like planting reveal values hierarchy. Backstory anchors tilt present stance without flattening. Closure choice feels compelled by consistent traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to charged poise in planting/whispering, reconfiguring remembrance as refusal with conceptual cost (ongoing burden shared tenuously); orientation anchors early (Mei in tea house post-birds). One tightening via bread-to-seeds progression narrows options legibly. Minor reflective expanse doesn't obscure closure causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard/tea house constrains guerrilla acts (secrecy for planting) and charges final image (kneeling in soil, courtyard "holds breath"); sensory hierarchy (frost on roses, spider web geometry) reflects noticer's bias, integrated via tactile action. Micro-setting (vines, wild roses) mirrors internal gentleness without overt symbolism. Environment shapes tactics indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist erasure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to planting as endurance/renunciation foreclosing rage-path with felt cost (patient burden); agency in micro-choices (digging deliberately) under lens coheres pressure. One cadence shift reweights via seeds' uncertainty. No abstraction—visceral in bread's "ghost sweetness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (sacred in ordinary refusals) emerges organically from particulars (stale bread offering, spider's unseen work), resonant CR at end reweights premise (absolution as perpetual asking) without moralizing; subtext in images (vines swallowing tea house) invites ambiguity on memory's weight. Protagonist arc inextricable, counter-readings plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (creeping changes, spider geometry); rhythmic modulation builds tenderness (long patient sentences to deliberate actions). Compression purposeful, taught early via noticing motif; diction controlled, lexicon fits gentle observer. No head-hopping, elision pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (multi-job lines like bread unwrap tying backstory/action); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops beyond taught "noticing" pattern. Minor scaffold in reflective phrasing (e.g., "she noticed" stems) doesn't dull closure image. Clean grammar, specific verbs (unwrapped, knelt, whispered) propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality and guerrilla gardening transforms memory trope into tactile refusal; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via spider/seed parallel, inevitable in hindsight. Particulars (Chen Family wrapper) anchor originality without gimmickry; bold vision commits to quiet ingenuity.</comment>
