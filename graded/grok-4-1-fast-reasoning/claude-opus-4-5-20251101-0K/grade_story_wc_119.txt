<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: contradictory impulses between holding spy secrets and releasing them culminate in the earned choice to box the specs, with embodied cost in "forty years was long enough." Final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy, transposing spy past into prophetic present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fortunes and backstory builds to CR closure when she boxes specs and writes final fortune, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of abandoning spy identity legible in "orchestrate her own revelation." Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam flashing specs and waves striking rocks constrain isolation and charge final image, mirroring internal orchestration; sensory hierarchy (rotating light, fog silence) filters through prophetic POV without tourism. Micro-setting (circular desk, specs) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transpose spy life via fortunes) signaled early tightens via journalist's arrival, forcing agency in releasing specs—foreclosing secrecy path with felt cost of identity shift. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload; cost unmistakable in planned handover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from predictive fortunes and plain-spoken revelation, answered non-literally by final fortune "Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home," reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity in dismissed truths lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature: cryptic, pattern-seeing diction ("orchestrate meaning itself") modulates rhythmically to charged poise. Compression of reflections taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via multi-job lines (e.g., specs flashing evokes past while advancing decision); no loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors in closure beat. Strategic telling anchors reflections efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-spy fortune teller with microdots transforms prophecy/spy tropes through cookie "open secrets," risking reflective mode that pays off in inevitable CR. Bold premise integrity heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
