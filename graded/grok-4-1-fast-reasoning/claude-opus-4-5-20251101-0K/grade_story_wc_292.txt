<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in trembling fingers and warming nail; motivation rooted in ancestor honor drives micro-choices like calling Torres; minor label-speak in "nervously confident" slightly abstracts peak embodiment without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as decoding density builds to data correlation and Torres' shift; Charged Poise closure in phone reach and page organizing reconfigures exile with 14-month cost legible; orientation anchored immediately in station and shifted jet stream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Copper nail as micro-setting recurs to constrain emotion and charge final image; howling winds and reinforced glass integrate tactilely into action; sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode/warn tightens via undeniable data correlation, narrowing to 14-month urgency; agency in intercom call and data presentation forecloses skepticism with dread cost persisting; one decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked warnings honored emerges organically from journals and nail reprise without statement; final image reweights legacy with non-literal resonance as dread shares space with purpose; complexity in ignored history avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward ciphers/maps; dialogue natural with Torres' skepticism carrying subtext; rhythmic prose modulates from dread to poise without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with sentences advancing revelation and image; varied rhythm supports propulsion, no loops or scaffolds; "spongey dread" purposeful without figurative muddle in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ciphered climate poetry predicting cycles transforms trope of ignored warnings; risk in verse decoding pays off at data match; specific nail legacy avoids generic inheritance.</comment>
