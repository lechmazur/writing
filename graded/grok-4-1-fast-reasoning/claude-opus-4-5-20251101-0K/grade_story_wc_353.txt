<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in outward vs. inward sound approaches act in scene, culminating in earned instrument creation; motivation rooted in grandmother's training and aching hands compels high-stakes shift with visible cost in failed prior carvings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed experiments to crack-pattern insight, yielding Charged Poise closure in bone-music bloom; cost legible in "silence remained, intensely quiet" as music forecloses air-travel path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove and sculpture's stress cracks constrain choices, charging final image where roots drink vibrations; tactile details like tracing cracks integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music in silence) signaled early tightens texturally via crack discovery narrowing options to body-conduction; agency in carving/strumming forecloses prior tactics with felt cost of persistent silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-as-channels emerges organically from crack-tracing to "empathy in motion" realization, reweighting silence premise in final hedgehog/trees connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close voice with symphonic perceptual signature ("movements and crescendos") modulates rhythmically; purposeful compression in discoveries maintains stability through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from insulator study to strum; minor figurative density in music metaphors purposeful and pattern-taught, no loops dulling "music bloomed inside her bones."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent world, wood-trauma reading, and bone-conduction transforms tropes; crack-patterns-to-instrument turn feels inevitable, risking bold conceptual physics payoff.</comment>
