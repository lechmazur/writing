<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pivotal pavilion choice shows contradictory impulses—full deposit vs. selective—to earn renunciation with cost of retained wisdom; curse embodiment via tasting anchors motivation without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory/memory density reconfigures stake via on-page RR closure; selective deposit in "She kept the rest" lands cost legibly without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal pools constrain discovery choice and coral ice (emotion as cold) charges pavilion climax; rain-softened dunes evolve causally to mirror internal smoothing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smooth memories) deepens via coral's tasted emptiness forcing surgical agency; Accumulative pressure tightens to foreclose full relief with visible retained-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of purposeful remorse emerges via selective deposit reweighting curse's premise; final cooking/touch image resonates without moral, tying to sandpaper metaphor organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (taste-synesthesia) biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic modulation sustains texture through pressure, dialogue sparse but subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful figures like "sturdy brittle" avoid muddle, no loops obscure pavilion closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh tasting-curse/contagion synthesis transforms remorse storage into selective emotional calculus; pavilion discovery risks bold world-logic payoff without retreat.</comment>
