<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia embodied concretely in "green hummed a deep bass note," driving micro-choices like conducting aurora; final realization ("wonder had never needed certification") earned via prior tension between silence's perfection and need to ring. Contradictory impulses act in scene (hush as "masterpiece" yet "stagnation"). Minor backstory summary on search slightly abstracts motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure: Meren's realization "silence had been an unfinished work" reconfigures premise with cost (sheet crumbles to dust, tears freeze). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene holds without shards. One tightening via "silence could become stagnation" narrows to ringing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices (ceiling opening enables conducting light); recurring crystal bell charges final image as "permanent addition." Sensory hierarchy synesthetic/POV-specific (colors hum frequencies). Details evolve causally (ice trembles, glitters with residual music).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder vs. Council's obsolescence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via silence/sound tension; agency in conducting forecloses inaction with cost (frozen tears, sheet's destruction). Escalation driven by her translation of aurora, reweighting options at "violent creation." No reversals needed; pressure coheres texturally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as necessity via silence/sound partnership) emerges organically from particulars like aurora-weaving and bell's completion; final image ("living silence that contained all possible songs") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in "certify wonder as essential" shifts to irrelevance, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("every sound... bloomed into color"); rhythmic prose modulates to lyric intensity at climax ("cascading harmonics"). No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "raised her hands and began to read the aurora" advances multiple layers); rhythm varies for ear (short punchy sentences at ringing). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("diamonds that scattered," "prismed light") borders coherence slip in opening but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, light-to-sound, and "sculpted hush" transforms quest trope into CR on wonder; risk in solo lyric ascent pays off in inevitable bell-ringing. Non-obvious aurora conduction heightens stakes organically.</comment>
