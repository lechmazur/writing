<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as listener intensifies credibly through embodied patience and micro-choices like offering the locket, earning the final communal decision. Mrs. Okonkwo's grief reveals flaws via trembling hands and hidden catch. Minor slip in overt epiphany ("listening healed not because...") borders therapy-speak but anchors to present action without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density building to Charged Poise closure when locket opens with key, reconfiguring silence into shareable grief. Orientation anchors immediately in courtyard/dawn. On-page cost legible in "seventeen years of silence in her palm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dawn light evolution from gray-to-gold constrains revelations, charging final shadows/exhale image.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Maren with perceptual bias toward objects/stories; voice modulates poetically yet grounded.
