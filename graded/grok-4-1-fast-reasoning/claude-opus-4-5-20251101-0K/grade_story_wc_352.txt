<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism-minded perception consistently drives micro-choices like reading margins and positioning in chamber; guardian realization earned via inversion's embodied spectrum shift, with burden as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist/inversion density deepens knowledge; CR closure in doodle-marking reconfigures her role with future-guardian cost legible in "some doors should remain closed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist constrains revelation and ascent; inversion's dreamlike lift and ceiling carvings charge final hollow-doodle image, with sensory hierarchy via prism bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Countdown tightens stake to access combinations; inversion reversal narrows options via timed reveal, agency in waiting/positioning, burden cost unmistakable in hesitation and discernment duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vigilance-as-seeding emerges organically from doodle chain; final image of her luminous mark offers resonant answer to preservation question, reweighting curiosity as burdened duty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with prismatic perceptual signature in "fractured angles" and spectrum bursts; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to suspended poise under inversion stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with no loops or scaffolds; varied syntax breathes with timed beats, metaphors like "mist pooled like luminescent milk" cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravity-inversion grotto transforms secret-hunt trope via prism physics and doodle-cycle; risk in liminal rules heightens stakes, synthesis feels inevitable in guardian inheritance.</comment>
