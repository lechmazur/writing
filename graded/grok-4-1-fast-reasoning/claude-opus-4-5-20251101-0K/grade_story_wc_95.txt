<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's mechanical arm integrates backstory with micro-choices like practicing parry, compelling higher-stakes confrontation; motivation to "turn questions into destinations" roots actions consistently. Internal conflict emerges in embodied precision vs. lost flesh warmth. Krell applies targeted pressure via concealed blade; voices distinguish via idiom. Minor telling in motivation summary slightly undercuts 9+ contradictory impulses test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: intercepted message → sundial cipher → debate modification → duel DC. Orientation anchors immediately in atrium/brook. Closure DC lands on-page in "Elara stood among shattered teacups... sundial now exposed" with legible cost (shattered pretenses, physical fight). One tightening via confrontation suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains choices (cipher discovery) and charges closure (exposed). Brook witnesses indifferently, mirroring theme in final image; glass enables arena choreography. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's priorities (gears whir, shadows align); evolved with duel damage. 9+ test met by constraint/final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose overture) signaled early, tightens causally to duel narrowing options. Agency in topic shift forces blade draw; cost visible in defensive posture, shattered teacups. Escalation driven by Elara's decisions; moral calculus (peace vs. war) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of revelation vs. concealment emerges via sundial/message, resolves non-literally in exposed cipher/brook stasis. Subtext in dialogue implications ("ethics of concealing peace"); irony in embassy duplicity. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, but overt philosophizing ("philosophy without destination was merely elegant procrastination") borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (philosophical lens on shadows/brook). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("curious that it remains unfinished" provokes); rhythms distinguish (Krell's velvet iron vs. Elara's direct). Prose texture modulates intensity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., arm click "meditative and practical"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in "smile sharp as any blade, words wrapped in velvet courtesy" risks coherence, but no loops/artifacts dull closure. Clean syntax emphasizes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk philosopher-decipherer transforms duel trope via cipher/sundial. Mechanical arm fencing feels inevitable; risk in velvet-steel dialogue heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particular details (danish tin pastoral) anchor vision.</comment>
