<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the final scene—Elias's polished calm armors rejection ("You took enough") yet yields to shared silence and bill-handling, earning relational stasis with the cost of unrealized escapes. Father's weathered uncertainty contrasts Elias's facade, shown through reverent ledger work. Flawless character-bound knowledge and flaws drive inevitable return without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds seamlessly across shards, with pattern taught in opening circus train/stones; closure lands as Charged Poise RR in dusky caboose scene, reconfiguring paths from traps to invitations via "something ease in his chest" and bills freed to travel—legible relational cost felt on-page. Mosaic shards (Track B) cohere with legible transitions and single tightening at startup collapse. Orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Circus train and foreign bills as micro-settings constrain choices (refuge from shame, gallery of escapes) and charge final image—bills handled reverently under "amber and shadow," mirroring internal reconciliation. Sensory details selective via Elias's bias (rusted elephants as witnesses). No white-room; lived-in choreography clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with bloodline via circling paths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through stones' repurposing and collapse-forced return, tightening to stance crystallization in final silence—agency in endurance forecloses escape with emotional cost. One decisive deepening suffices; father's persistence coheres pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of returns as invitations emerges organically from stone shifts (warnings to welcomes) and bills' impossibility, resonating in final image without moralizing—"these should travel, even if we don't" reweights prior dreams non-literally. Subtext in silences and implications avoids platitudes; complexity embraces flawed inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (micro-expressions like father's highway reads); diction/rhythm modulate from polished summaries to charged final compression. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It kept people out"), goal-driven; distinct voices in brief exchange. No head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "paths circle back" motif varies without loops; rhythm breathes via shard lengths, read-aloud natural. Minor register elevation ("strange arithmetic of return") fits voice but borders purple in peak; no scaffolds, clean syntax variety. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Circus train fused with robber legacy and currency dreams offers fresh synthesis—prodigal inversion where stasis invites rest, risk-taking in mosaic shards heightens inevitability of return without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: highway/circus/stones irreplaceable for thematic charge.</comment>
