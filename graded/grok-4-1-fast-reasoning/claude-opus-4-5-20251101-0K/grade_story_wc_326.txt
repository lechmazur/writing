<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via heartbeat counting and porcelain shard as embodied regret anchor Mira's motivation; contradictory fear and reclamation impulses act in the ink-watching scene. Final wholeness earned by causal memory-pulling with felt emotional cost. No diagnostic labels or tidy paths; flaws drive the arc without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink density builds patterns/memories toward CR closure where ghost dissolves and she walks out uncounting heartbeats. Orientation anchored early ("opal observatory... heavy snow"). Cost legible in "heavier and lighter at once," reweighting existence premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shimmering opal walls and trapped light mirror internal wisdom, constraining ritual via glass table for ink. Snow muffles world, charging isolation; sensory hierarchy narrows to ink pools and heartbeats under crisis. Body (palm shard) and tool (ink) charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim ghost via failures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as ink patterns yield mother's face, deepening knowledge/options. Agency in focused defragmenting forecloses fragmented self with emotional cost. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes pre-ink pour withholds full visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom in failures/patterns) emerges organically from ink defragmenting regrets, porcelain reprise, and final shard-to-chest image reweighting success myth. No moralizing; mother's face moment earns insight via particulars. Resonance lingers in "failures like lanterns," non-literal CR answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (ephemeral constellations, heartbeat metronome) modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable close third-person POV. Compression in ink ritual taught early, legible at closure. Prose texture reflects Mira's meditative fragmentation/reassembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels from static clear to ink shift to snow exit. Figuratives (ink "constellations," opal "trapped light") cohere without muddle, peaking in closure image. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost ritual via analog ink in observatory transforms ghost/identity tropes through failure-lanterns premise. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes; porcelain/ink/opal cohere as inevitable organic frame. Non-obvious CR feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
