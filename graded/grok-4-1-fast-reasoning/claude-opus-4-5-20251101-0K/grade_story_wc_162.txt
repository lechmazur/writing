<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through wood-grain intuition and logbook tracing; final choice to step through earned by layered realizations of "featherly determined" resolve vs. endless drifting. Contradictory impulses (patience vs. action) act in scene without summary. Minor reflection anchors tightly to present cues, avoiding unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of threshold images to CR closure ("The threshold opened. She stepped through"), reweighting lost/exile premise with 17-year separation cost legible in architect's renewed search. Orientation anchored early (Wren on prism terrace post-maze). Single scene with purposeful reflective shards holds lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism terrace and bench wood constrain choices (tilting prompts palm press, grain reading yields logbook insight) and charge final violet-edge image. Sensory hierarchy (light lies, fractured hush hums) reflects Wren's intuitive bias. Details evolve causally (drifting halts at closure).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end drifting via sacred thresholds) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through code reinterpretation as prayers, forcing stance crystallization at edge. Agency in retrieval/tracing narrows to step-through trade-off; cost felt in separation's "necessary distances." One tightening sufficient, but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds/seeking-waiting emerges from particulars (maze entrance echo, logbook bird sketch reprise), culminating in non-literal resonant answer: "sacred spaces exist wherever someone waits and someone seeks." No moralizing; complexity lingers in butterfly parallels without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (intuiting truths via grain, hush) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation accelerates in "featherly determined" resolve to closure. Single POV stable, lyric compression taught early via refracting whispers. No dialogue; voice coheres as Wren's fractured lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "CAVOK: Ceiling And Visibility OK. Permission to see clearly"); varied rhythm supports ear test. Minor overwriting in "clouds that tasted of forgotten harvests" strains slightly without muddle; purposeful "necessary distances" motif avoids loops. Closure image clear, no artifacts dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn-maze loss, prism exile, wood intuition transforms lost-child trope via logbook-prayers pivot to homeward CR. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable "featherly determined" inflection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
