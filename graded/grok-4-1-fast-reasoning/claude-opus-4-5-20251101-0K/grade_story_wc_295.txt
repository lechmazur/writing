<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied tears and thumb on daylily reveal contradictory isolation vs. sharing impulse; final publishing choice earned by brother's death as visible cost, with concrete interiority throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as stellar patterns tighten knowledge to CR closure; inscription translation reconfigures premise with brother's suicide as legible emotional cost in "Marcus's mistake."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Telescope tracking and dome groan constrain observation choices; fogged breath and pulsing stars charge final dawn image, mirroring internal dawning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant decoding stake deepens via undeniable pattern correspondence, forcing sharing renunciation of isolation; exhaustion/tears pay visible cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inscription "What breaks one may bend many" offers resonant answer to isolation premise, reweighting telegrams/stars without moralizing; publishing fuses elements organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual bias in "stars pulsed... patient" and "gray fingers of morning" sustains introspective texture; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density weaves action/reflection without loops; minor simile density ("ink drops," "heartbeat") risks slight overwrite in observation beats but props momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Variable stars-to-glyphs encoding transforms ancestry trope into astronomy-specific calculus of suffering; risk in celestial-temple synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
