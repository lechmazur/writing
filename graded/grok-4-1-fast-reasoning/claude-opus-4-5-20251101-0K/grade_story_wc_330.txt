<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation peaks in the singing beat where scarred cords press against silence, earning the voice's return through prior discoveries; minor slip in archetypal carpenter backstory told without mid-crisis contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (halo warmth, bells, recording) tightens to on-page RR closure in the singing harmony with felt cost of broken notes; orientation anchors instantly in desert/train.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like dust incense and wind bells constrain exploration and charge the halo's final pulse against chest; perceptual filter via carpenter eyes (carousel fragments as kin) mirrors internal shift without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) deepens accumulatively via halo/recording discoveries forcing the singing agency with embodied cost (rough notes, push); one tightening suffices, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete wholeness emerges organically from halo fragment and singing reprise, reweighting silence in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via "canvas" transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (silence as "possibility," warmth/light biases) with rhythmic modulation to short, propulsive sentences in singing climax; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "whispering gleam" echoes) slightly muddles peak gleam-to-song transition without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay and carpenter voice-recovery via halo/phonograph transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight sans gimmick.</comment>
