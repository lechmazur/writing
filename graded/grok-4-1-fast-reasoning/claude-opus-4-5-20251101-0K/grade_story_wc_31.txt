<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation intensifies through embodied grief and micro-choices like descending despite the festival, culminating in an earned perceptual change; interiority particular via synesthetic afterglow. Contradictory impulses (family duty vs. obsession) act in scene without summary. Final realization forecloses ordinary perception with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from purposeful wandering to vial uncorking, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where Marcus sees lantern colors, reweighting premise with "beautiful and terrible" cost legible in "afterglow" line. Orientation anchored by ~100 words. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and tilted shelves constrain navigation and charge synesthetic climax; "pale green whisper-light" filters through Marcus's lamplighter bias. Final lanterns as "chromatic signature" recharges prior ship glow. Sensory hierarchy purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover wife's color-of-sound secret) signaled early, tightens via key unlocking vial with agency in uncorking; pressure coheres accumulatively to foreclose unseeing life. Cost unmistakable in "weight that could crush the unprepared."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of luminous truths emerges organically from vial chorus and final lantern sight, reweighting "hides behind truth" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "lantern in his chest" image lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature synesthetic ("sound possessed color"); diction/rhythm modulates from hush to chorus without drift. No elision or head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "colors rose like smoke, but he could hear them too" does triple duty. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; minor elevated diction fits voice, rhythm varies read-aloud. Closure image unblurred.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic vows in dry ship library transforms grief trope via "distilled synesthetic resonance"; risk in CR closure heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious synthesis inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
