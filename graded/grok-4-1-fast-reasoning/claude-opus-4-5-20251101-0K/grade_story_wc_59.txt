<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bedraggled prince's gaunt obsession and contradictory grief/exhilaration ("bitterly sweet") compel assembly and activation, earning knee-sinking tears and laughter as flawed endurance with visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: obsession density builds to egg activation and light pour, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("Genesis was always flawed") that reweights revival premise with hybrid cost, anchors clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stalactite-anchored palace and mechanical birds constrain contrastive isolation, mirroring internal state and charging final swaying "living heart" image that evolves causally with emergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory bursts (copper wings catching glow), no loops/artifacts; climax light "older, wilder" coherent without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid phoenix-machine births unprecedented wonder from extinction-mechanization synthesis, risking flawed revival for magnificent improper future that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
