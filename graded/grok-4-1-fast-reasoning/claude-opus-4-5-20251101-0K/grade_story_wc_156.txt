<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's contradictory impulses—scientific precision yielding to playful questioning—earn her shift to "restorer into restored"; hobo nickel embodies personal mythology, concretely reweighted in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failed sounds build density to question's pattern break, yielding nested doorway CR with curiosity-cost legible in "exchange certainty for curiosity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's parabolic reflectors constrain positioning and sound multiplication, charging nested panel image; sonic-tactile details (thunder in metal skin) filter through restorer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore resistant panel) deepens via laugh-reveal echo to personal question tightening options; cost felt in foreclosed certainty, charging final wondering steps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nested Margots non-literally answer restoration-as-participation, reweighting hobo nickel parallel without moralizing; emergent from sonic failures to wonder's frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sonic-visual perceptual signature ("frequencies rather than petals"); rhythmic modulation heightens realization without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels to "nested awakenings" integration, framing echo in opening/closing lines recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sonic murals/nested curiosity portrait synthesizes fresh from garden logic, transforming epiphany trope; risk of infinite regressions inevitable, heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
