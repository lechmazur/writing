<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in personal losses ("Why her daughter had stopped calling") compels the departure choice with embodied contradiction (competence unloved), earning endurance; Volkov applies relational pressure without stereotyping. Subtly confident trait shown in micro-choices like filing notes regardless of return. Voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: falcon return tightens density toward Charged Poise closure in final image ("Maren kept walking... trusting that finding it would be enough"), reconfiguring personal vs. geographical truth with conceptual cost (unanswerables foreclosed). Orientation anchored para 1; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain timing/choice (ice shifts in days), condensation pattern as recurring micro-setting charges final breath image, mirroring internal scars via POV-filtered perception. Sensory selection urgent and hierarchical (falcon's trajectory over vague north).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map corrections as personal truth) signaled early, falcon deepens via time pressure, forcing endurance agency; Volkov tests commitment. Accumulative escalation coheres to Charged Poise with felt cost (potential non-return, notes filed anyway).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of geographical confession vs. human burdens emerges organically from particulars (phrasebook mistranslation, river origins); final walking image reweights premise non-literally, charging prior reflections with resonant ambiguity (rivers have sources people don't).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cartographic perceptual signature (condensation as "smaller languages"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Volkov's "Herald" vs. Maren's "necessary"). Rhythm modulates from reflective to propulsive, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels accumulatively; water/condensation images purposeful without muddle. Minor repetition in "held" (ice, silence) pattern-taught for closure echo, no loops or scaffolds dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh cartographer-obsessive transforms explorer trope via Evenki phrasebook and condensation reading; final reconfiguration ("geography finally confessed") inevitable from subtle particulars, risking quiet poise over confrontation.</comment>
