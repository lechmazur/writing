<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory duty-love impulses act in echoing then completing phrases; final stasis earned by crystallizing grief without resurrecting Elias, embodied in touching a wave.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of regrets builds to atlas-light crystallization (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in "She could not bring Elias back," reconfiguring burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracked dome's scattered light constrains/enables climax choice and charges final glass menagerie image; sensory details (scraping scythe, prismatic fragments) selectively POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of regret-burden deepens via agency in lifting atlas and completing phrases, tightening under accumulative lens; unmistakable cost in accepting irrecoverable love amid crystals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystallized monsters-to-figures reconfigures "echo of sacrifice" non-literally, answering naming-fears question; resonance from particulars like sea serpents shifting meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (reaper's soul-residue lens) with rhythmic control in peak crystallization; diction modulates intimacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density propels via varied syntax in "ink shimmered, then hardened, then rose...tiny glass serpents"; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ink-to-crystal alchemy via cartographer's margins transforms reaper trope organically; risk of lyric closure heightens grief stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
