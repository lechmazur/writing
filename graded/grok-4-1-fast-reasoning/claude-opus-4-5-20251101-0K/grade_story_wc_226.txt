<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's motivation to preserve complexity is rooted in concrete traits like paint-stained fingers and childhood mischief evolving into defiance; contradictory impulses act in rehearsal ("She stole bread..." variants) and climax choice. Final preservation earned by prior planning with felt risk of Elders' authority. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rehearsal echoes to ritual multiplicity, tightening via mist thinning and light breaking. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in "pale spire now held something unprecedented" with conceptual cost of dissolved Elder authority. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon echoes and bone towers constrain choices (poets positioned for refraction) and charge final image ("warm bone"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (paint on names, mist dulling hearing). Details evolve causally (mist thins, towers hum).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve mother wholly) signaled early, escalates via live clock (light breaks) and agency (speaking seven truths, poets weave). Deepening narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost in Elders' failed shouts and refracted authority. Moral calculus between erasure and complexity viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness without flattening emerges from particulars like mother's hands and bread truths; final image reweights premise non-literally ("complete woman, complicated and unflattened"). Subtext in echoes layering complexity; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in precedent broken.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mist-amplified whispers as childhood play); voice modulates rhythmically from hush to spiraling prayers. Prose texture biased to artist's defiance; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (echo rehearsals layer without redundancy); rhythm varies (short whispers to rising meters). No loops, artifacts, or muddled figures; "refracting through endless echoes" integrates cleanly in climax.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-tower memory and echo-refraction transforms forgiveness trope; risk in poetry subversion heightens stakes organically. Premise follows implications to unprecedented absorption without retreat.</comment>
