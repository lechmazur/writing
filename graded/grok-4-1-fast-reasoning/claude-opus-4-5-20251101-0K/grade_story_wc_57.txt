<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's infinite patience embodied in hours of decoding despite accumulating snow and stiff joints creates authentic endurance with visible physical cost; interiority particular via tactile tracing of knots. Final stance shift to seeking weavers earned by progressive revelation, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: progressive knot decoding builds density to pattern break in final sequence, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing (invitation/test revelation) with felt cost in bodily stiffness and conceptual weight of vanishing knowledge. Orientation anchored instantly in dock/harbor/snow; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow accumulation, fog evolution constrain isolation and patience, charging final image of covered footprints; sensory hush (tactile rope, dissolving flakes) mirrors internal focus. Fulgurite as micro-setting reprises to reweight preservation, satisfying 9+ test without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving encoded knowledge) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening comprehension (fishing techniques to invitation), narrowing to Charged Poise with legible physical cost (stiff joints) and opportunity foreclosure (old ways' risk). Single tightening sufficient; agency in patient decoding drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Preservation-through-transformation theme emerges organically from seeds, knots, fulgurite—final image reconfigures (chaos to permanence) without statement, offering resonant non-literal answer with conceptual cost of extinction risk. Particulars avoid platitudes; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tactile, patient noticing of knots as "tactile grammar"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure without head-hopping or withholding. Lyrical diction character-specific, no register drift; 9+ test passed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/action/insight without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm (short hush beats amid lyric flow) accelerates to closure image unscathed. Zero artifacts, precise verbs (coax, trace); opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Knots-as-encoded-knowledge premise fresh synthesis of folklore/botany, transformed via tactile decoding; risk in lyric patience builds inevitable CR without gimmick. Irreplaceable particularity (river deltas in rope) heightens stakes organically; 9+ test met.</comment>
