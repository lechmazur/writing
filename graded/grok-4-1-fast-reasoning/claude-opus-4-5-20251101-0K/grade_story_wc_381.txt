<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush prophecy roots in decades of craft, intensifying through embodied ritual; interiority concrete in "tranquil blaze within herself." Contradictory impulses (fierce/peaceful) act in the stretching-silences beat, earning endurance at retrieval with trembling fingers as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from placing wing to expanding awareness, cadence shifts at dawn opening-eyes beat into Charged Poise RR. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in prophecy's "gentler shape" and damp wing retrieval; orientation anchored early in brook haven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook and origami wing as micro-setting constrain ritual choice and charge final retrieval image; sensory details (silver-lit branches, earth pulse) selective via POV bias toward silence. "Terrestrially cosmic" sensation grounds cosmic reach, mirroring internal state without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, deepens via silence-stretching under Accumulative lens, narrowing to "smoothed hush" with agency in awareness-flow. Cost legible in physical toll ("trembling fingers," "stiff legs") charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of malleable prophecies emerges organically from hush-ritual particulars; bird's song filling cultivated silence offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting urgency into "uncertainty" without moralizing. Final image callbacks wing and brook for earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature tuned to silences and cosmic rhythms; voice texture in rhythmic prose ("time passed strangely... measured only by the brook's patient flow") modulates intensity purposefully. No head-hopping, diction biased to summoner's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in peak ritual ("stretching them, like pulling taffy"); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (candle flame). Minor figurative density in cosmic reach but pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-summoning transforms prophecy trope via grounded ritual logic; risk in "mapping silence" as negative space pays off inevitably in hush-closure. Origami wing and brook anchor bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
