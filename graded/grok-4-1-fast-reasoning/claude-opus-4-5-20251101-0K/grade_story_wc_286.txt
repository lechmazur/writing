<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zen potter's interiority shines in clay-whispering fractures and hands that "expect nothing and accept everything," earning her final reconfiguration from stillness-seeking to purposeful movement with embodied cost in the closing wheel-spin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via layered discoveries to CR closure: Serin's understanding of the disc reweights stability, with cost legible in her "not made for permanence" endurance and final vessel-making image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Oasis micro-setting (hives, sun-striated dust, thrumming disc) constrains path-tracing choice and charges final image of clay wedged on "warm stone," palms' shadows integrating sensory hierarchy through potter's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend timeline resistance) deepens accumulatively via disc-touch flood to choice-tightening realization; agency in kneeling/lifting glass forecloses old worldview with felt conceptual cost, though external pressure remains oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kindness-directed stability emerges organically from disc's timeline-choosing, answered non-literally in final "reaching, a turning toward" image that reweights potter's craft without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light/clay metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates from wasteland bite to honeyed poise, perceptual bias character-specific without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (light-to-disc as amber/memory), propulsion peaks in "fractured timelines rushed... like water through a broken dam," varying rhythm flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline fractures and phototropic disc transforms post-apoc oasis into kindness-engine; risk in conceptual CR (stability as "movement refined") feels inevitable from bee/light particulars.</comment>
