<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority in reactive visions and methodical handling of fragments; motivation to reconstruct intensifies via family revelations with earned endurance of past's unchangeability. Minor slip in summarized family visits lacking embodied contradiction, but doesn't touch closure stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from valve to reconstructed narratives; clear orientation by para 2; CR closure in "valve... testament" reconfigures debris to meaning with cost of irrevocable loss legible in final quay thoughts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (salt, verdigris, rain luminescence) filtered through archivist bias; harbor/rain constrains patient reconstruction, charging final lamp-lit image where weather evolves to mirror healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fragment-reconstruction signaled early, deepens accumulatively to family closures and harbor recovery; agency in staggered analysis forecloses chaos with felt cost of unchangeable past, but lacks one sharp option-narrowing turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absences-as-paths emerges organically from valve's evolution and Elena's work; final image resonant reconfiguration reweights fragments without moralizing, embracing complexity of enduring loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature in pattern-seeing (e.g., "gaps... told their own stories"); rhythmic modulation builds texture without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm (read-aloud flows); purposeful compression in reflective beats advances insight without loops; concrete images propel to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh archivist premise transforms salvage tropes via reactive visions and navigated absences; valve's reprise feels inevitable, with risk in quiet endurance heightening stakes organically.</comment>
