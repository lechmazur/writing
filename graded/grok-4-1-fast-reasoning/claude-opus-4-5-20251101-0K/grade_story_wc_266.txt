<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in concrete regrets like the unsaid "I love you" to her sister and unheld mother's hand, driving her from lost to reclaiming with embodied warmth of flames; guides apply gentle pressure without overshadowing. Contradictory impulses (cowardice whisper vs. survival correction) act in scene, earning the final gathering. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via glimpses (university, passport) tightening to cresting ridge and punch press as Charged Poise RR with cost in reclaimed flames reweighting her unlived life. Orientation anchors early on ridgeway post-leash break. Single continuous scene, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist parting for personal glimpses and light-shore flames constrain choices by revealing flames "that bore her name," charging final image; sensory hierarchy (rhythm of voices, lantern swing) reflects Mira's threshold state. Veiled ridgeway evolves from reluctant mist to glowing horizon without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim courage) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening twilight glimpses narrowing from lost to claiming, with agency in punch press foreclosing empty-handed traversal; cost felt in gathered flames' warmth vs. prior surrender. Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of courage waiting emerges organically from driftwood flames and guide's "It waits," resonating in final walk with non-literal answer reweighting regrets without moralizing; final image offers charged ambiguity of endless twilight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (shoreline rhythms, mist parting) stable in third-limited POV, modulating intensity; dialogue subtextual ("You were surviving") pursues goals naturally, distinct from narration. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (gentle swells to blazing star), high density integrates sensory/motif without loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in "colors that had no names" but consistent shoreline metaphors propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks cleanly at flame-gathering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry guides reclaiming unlived courage transforms regret trope via star-punch and light-shore; ridgeway vigil risks bold lyric accumulation, heightening stakes inevitably to "never too late" without hedging.</comment>
