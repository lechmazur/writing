<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's olfactorily sensitive trait roots motivation in concrete sensory details, with contradictory impulses (repulsion to attraction via the corpse flower's scent) acting in the vigil scene; final renunciation of staying feels earned by accumulated observations. Thessaly applies targeted pressure via philosophy lessons. Minor slip: epiphany at departure borders on over-articulated without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory journaling and sketches build density to CR closure—Mira's realization reweights serenity as motion, with cost in foreclosing village life legible in "surprising herself" and descent. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (climb, Canopica). One tightening via flower vigil suffices; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Treetop platforms and resin/smoke/decay smells constrain choices (climb, detect flower) and charge final image (mist-shrouded Canopica vs. forest floor). Olfactory hierarchy reflects Mira's bias perfectly. Sensory selection modulates with urgency, from dawn catalog to vigil assault.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed/wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through two-night vigil narrowing to acceptance of contradiction; agency in forcing scent exposure forecloses repulsion path with embodied cost (watering eyes, mouth-breathing). Pressure coheres to stance crystallization at departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in rejection emerges organically from scent progression and doodle transformation, culminating in non-literal CR: serenity "in how I move through the world below" reweights prior stillness-seeking without moralizing. Final image (seed to heart, mist fade) resonates with death-life tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with olfactory perceptual signature; voice texture (lyric rhythm in "wildflower hush") modulates serenity-to-insight. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You smell it"), advances philosophy. No head-hopping; elisions (flower location) pay off via attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "decay wrapped in sweetness" advances plot/character/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in metaphors like "tide's thought" but consistent/voice-motivated; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory quest in treetop geometry transforms corpse flower trope into wisdom-via-repulsion vehicle; risk in abstract philosophy grounded via smells/doodles heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on serenity feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
