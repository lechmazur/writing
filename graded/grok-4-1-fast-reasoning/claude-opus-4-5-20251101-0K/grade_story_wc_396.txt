<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (carries shadows yet chooses mercy) act in mirror glimpses; final self-inclusion earned by accumulated acts with embodied cost in chest warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mirror density reconfigures anomaly stake; closure RR via whole crystal lands on-page with self-empathy cost legible in "shadows didn't feel like chains."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice floes groaning below constrain travel risk early and charge final reconfiguration image where they "rearrange themselves" mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake deepens from message mystery to self-loss via glimpses forcing renunciation of self-denial; cost unmistakable in shadows transforming from ghosts to hounds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Empathy-as-connection theme emerges organically from mirrors; final orchard witness and beam sweep resonate non-literally without moralizing, though whispered line borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (shadows rippling alive, ice groaning) biases toward intuitive mercy; dialogue subtext sharp in keeper's reverent anomaly naming.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; opening simile stack ("prayer refusing," "shadows rippling") risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays in shadow transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mirrors archiving mercy glimpses synthesize anomaly premise into fresh emotional archive; risk of lyrical fantasy heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
