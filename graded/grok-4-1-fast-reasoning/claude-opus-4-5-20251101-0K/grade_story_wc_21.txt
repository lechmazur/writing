<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solemn archivist's motivation intensifies through embodied visions seizing her mid-task ("This morning, while shelving... ankle-deep in black water"), compelling descent; internal conflict in retrocognitive pull vs. present agency earns bridge role at closure without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vision density and journey shards build to Charged Poise closure ("carried the weight of voices... set them free"); orientation anchored in first line (floating library, dunes); cost legible in final "fierce, bittersweet knowledge."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains climax choice (descend into shadow, recognize debris patterns); recurring debris charges final image, mirroring internal states through "parley marks" from visions; sensory hierarchy (heat-ghosts, salt-crusted pillar) reflects archivist urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover manufactured riots truth) signaled early, tightens via recent debris ("Someone had been here recently") forcing parley; agency in cargo hatch climb and descent forecloses isolation path with relational cost at "bridge across which truth could finally walk."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unquiet history emerges organically from diary visions to live parley, reweighting premise in final image ("stories trap you only so you can finally set them free") without moralizing; ambiguity in "comfortable lies" lingers via bittersweet cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (archive bias in "cataloging testimonies... voices history tried to silence"); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Your grandmother's work" echoes visions); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "She was not alone."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("clouds the color of old bruises," "wound in the earth"); no loops or scaffolds; propulsion varies rhythm to acceleration at descent ("cracked concrete gave way to sand"), charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Retrocognitive ink and debris-parley synthesize fresh sci-fi history lens, transforming tropes via specific cipher/visions; risk in nonlinear shard visions pays off at inevitable descendant meeting, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
