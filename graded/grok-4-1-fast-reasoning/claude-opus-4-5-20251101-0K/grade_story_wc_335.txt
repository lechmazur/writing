<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in tea-reading moment where inward triangles signal self-conflict, compelling annotation choice with visible cost in restricted access; Thessaly's pressure forces micro-choice revelation without safety-hedging; Mira's backward walking and past exile flaw drive inevitable struggle organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (shadow, tea, swing) tightening to Charged Poise closure at wax-sealing, where inadequacy of words makes emotional cost legible; orientation anchors instantly in library/Mira; single shard scene with one deepening via tea analysis forecloses parade-reform option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass paperweight shadow pulses judgment and shifts toward evening, constraining Mira's reflective choice and charging final annotation; library's grimy specificity (heels on marble, dust-clogged shelves) mirrors internal anxiety through POV filter without catalog; micro-setting integrates tactilely into decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile reversal) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through tea geometry narrowing to conditional mentorship trade-off; agency in quill-grab/notation forecloses comfort path with on-page cost in "words felt inadequate"; coherent pressure via Thessaly crystallizes stance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of broken reflections reweighting imperfect light emerges implicitly from shard-mirror world and swing reprise, offering non-literal answer to transformation question; combative tenderness subtext layers via dialogue silences; no moralizing, resonance from Mira's arc inextricable from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward anxious patterns (clicking heels, tightening throat); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic (Thessaly's "That sounds like tenderness"), distinguishing voices; rhythmic modulation heightens under decision pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., teacup dregs anchor analysis/action); varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with scene; minor figurative density in opening shadow simile purposeful, not muddling closure; no loops, clean propulsion to sealing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh shard-mirror premise transforms exile trope through reversible logic and quiet resilience angle; combative tenderness synthesis feels inevitable from tea/micro-turns; risk in backward-walking tic personalizes without gimmick, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
