<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's watchful dreamer trait drives concrete micro-choices like sketching the moss pattern, revealing internal conflict between silent endurance and grief's weight. Final pendant proffer earns relational change with embodied vulnerability. Minor therapy-speak in "graft new meaning" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to Charged Poise closure in pendant exchange and hand-holding, reconfiguring rift with emotional cost legible in "I should have been there" / "You're here now." Orientation anchors early in data center and post-confession context. Single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss garden vividly integrates sensory details (emerald velvet, honeyed hush, fern columns) that mirror transformation and constrain choices, culminating in intertwined ferns charging final image. POV-filtered noticing reflects Mira's priorities, evolving with her sketches and walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of familial healing tightens accumulatively through Thea's arrival and pendant proffer, forcing stance crystallization with vulnerability cost. Agency in quiet attention and offering forecloses isolation path, felt in Thea's eyes filling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growth over wholeness emerges organically from moss patterns, pendant reinterpretation, and garden as reclaimed space, resonating in final intertwined ferns without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (e.g., "moss grew in a peculiar pattern") modulates rhythm under emotional pressure. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, distinguishing sisters briefly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images; purposeful figurative layering in descriptions fits accumulative texture without muddle. Minor paraphrase risk in moss pattern repetition, but anchors progression without loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center decay into moss garden transforms grief tropes via watchful observation and preserved moth twist. Quiet closure risks boldness, heightening thematic stakes organically.</comment>
