<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation from forger to vendor seeking story origins shows contradictory impulses in parole constraints vs. personal quest, embodied in bracelet pulses and slate preparations. Final realization earned through child's writing, with visible cost in her shifting belief. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract internal conflict without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to child's arrival and CR closure: realization reconfigures story origins with conceptual cost legible in "a person choosing to make the first mark." Orientation anchored immediately in library and parole; single scene coherent, one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard and swirling mists vividly constrain preparations and mirror fragmentation theme, charging final image of story taking root amid "permanent and about to shatter" trees. Sensory details (clouds like cream in coffee) selective through Vera's priorities; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption tightens accumulatively via child’s arrival, forcing stance crystallization in observation; cost felt in bracelet dimming and personal insight foreclosing past forgery path. Agency in welcoming and watching reweights options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via clean slates emerges organically from Vera's arc and child's writing, with final image offering non-literal answer: story beginnings in choice on forgiving surfaces. No moralizing; ambiguity in her "still learning" belief lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature in poetic biases (droplets finding purpose); rhythm modulates from reflective lull to charged ending. "Welcome" dialogue natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful (moonlight like mercury-pearl) without overwriting in peak child beat. Propulsion aligns with accumulative build to crisp final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parole math, glass world, and story origins transforms redemption trope; risk in fragmented lyric design heightens stakes, inevitable in child's smile amid churning mists.</comment>
