<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (hum "tastes of ash and wedding cake," felt in teeth); motivation rooted in inherited obsession compels studious endurance with felt cost of isolation. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the serene scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of 743 prior dawns accumulates to today's recording and final spine-trace, yielding Charged Poise RR—commitment to endless climbs reconfigures time-as-fabric with endurance cost legible in "every dawn she had ever collected."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and lamp constrain ritual path and timing, refracted light charges hands and future paper image; sensory details (cedar smell, pink snow) selectively bias to textures, mirroring POV without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture unique dawn texture signaled early via silence/hum dependency; accumulative deepening in mournful 58.3 Hz narrows to precise annotation, felt cost in rising sun's shift foreclosing moment. Enters 8+ as trade-off charges paper's weight, but pressure serene without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-textured-fabric emerges implicitly via dawn collections into paper that carries "deeper than words"; final labyrinth image offers non-literal CR repricing histories as enduring beyond human sequence, reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature tuned to textures/hums; rhythmic prose modulates from studious calm to resonant close ("traced her fingers along its worn spine"), diction biased to sensory idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensation, reflection propulsion; varied rhythm with purposeful repetition ("hum") fits textural lens, but figurative density ("gold and violet," "trapped stars") borders overwrite without muddle. Minor synonym churn on "dawn" unpenalized as pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer ritual, dawn hums into textured paper, bonsai histories transforms quiet obsession into resonant ingenuity; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable closure image.</comment>
