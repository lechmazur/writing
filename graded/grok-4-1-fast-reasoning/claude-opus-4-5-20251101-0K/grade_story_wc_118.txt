<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual trait roots motivation in concrete listening to walls/paper, earning purpose shift at "understood her purpose with sudden clarity"; limited contradictory impulses under minimal opposition prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from diary echoes to tapestry via silo's hum, landing CR closure at "axis waiting to be restored" with conceptual cost of ancient causation; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo's concrete curves constrain probing path and charge discoveries; recurring "bronze quiet" motif mirrors perceptual hum, evolving to frame final eastward walk and axis mourning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of story-collection deepens accumulatively to map-reconstruction under Textural lens; tapestry find narrows options with burden of correction, felt in "weight of an axis."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tapestry dragons as ancient guardians reweight tilted world's premise non-literally; emergent theme of hidden warnings arises from perceptual particulars, lingering in "secret... beginning to unfold."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited sustains biased perceptual signature ("walls began to hum with recognition"); lyrical rhythm modulates discovery intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("fingers trailing along spines"); purposeful "bronze quiet" refrain avoids loops, though minor elevated diction edges in realizations slightly dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wall-listening synthesizing post-Silence history with medieval axis-guardians transforms discovery trope organically; purpose-map realization feels inevitable from early perceptual logic.</comment>
