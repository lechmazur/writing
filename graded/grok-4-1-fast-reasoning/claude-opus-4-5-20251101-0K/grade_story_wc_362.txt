<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between despising "mystic" title and embracing intuition via prism; final shift from publication to personal honor earned through layered observations with embodied cost in trembling hands. Contradictory impulses act in scene as scientific methods yield emotional strata.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns builds to CR closure in melting frost carrying "fragment of preserved feeling," with conceptual cost of singular, non-reproducible truth legible on page. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor mist and frost patterns constrain choices (deliberate parking, prism refraction) and charge final spiral image glowing with "accumulated love." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities; micro-setting (car window, prism) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotional absorption) deepens via prism revelation of strata, narrowing from theory-proof to self-proof with felt cost in melting frost; agency in tracing patterns forces trade-off under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotional memory in objects emerges organically via frost strata and prism; final image reweights "truthful lies" with resonant non-literal answer ("Some lies...haven't found their evidence yet") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns as emotional maps); rhythmic control modulates from hush to parting mist, prose texture character-specific without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., "silence relocated"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful in peak (frost "geological strata") without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional archaeology in frost/prism transforms mystic-science trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grounded particulars.</comment>
