<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via fractal perceptions and embodied actions (kneeling, tapping); motivation consistent in transforming obstacles, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from routine to new debris interpretation; Charged Poise closure in final smile/prophecy reconfigures existence with conceptual cost of sea's chaos legible in "take it back, one note at a time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating orchard, driftwood logs, and cloud fractals constrain choices (debris mounting, weather reading) and charge final image; sensory details (sounds, visuals) filtered through prophetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming wreckage signaled early; accumulative escalation via cloud shift and note-finding deepens density, but lacks sharp option foreclosure or trade-off to fully charge closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fractal resonance theme emerges organically from clouds, wreckage, and orchard sounds, culminating in non-literal CR of chaos-as-meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with fractal-obsessed perceptual signature stable in close third; rhythm modulates purposefully with blue hour deepening, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; fractal metaphors consistent and pattern-taught early, enhancing rather than muddling peak interpretive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreckage orchestra and cloud-fractal prophecy transforms sea-survival tropes; bold lyric risk heightens resonance in inevitable final reconfiguration.</comment>
