<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—grief and wonder sharing breath—embody cheerfully in her smile amid sorrow and laughing tears; micro-choices like gathering seeds reveal values under pressure. Final renunciation of "finding" earns peace with felt cost of eternal grief. Interiority particular via transliteration, no stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from glass feelings to seed-layered insight, culminating in CR where paths transform with conceptual cost of reconfiguration. Orientation anchors immediately in descent and role. Closure image of planted seeds reweights premise indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iridescent geode constrains reflection and charges final image—tears scattered into rainbows, seeds tucked in crevices—mirroring internal states tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (humming feet, warm glass) filters through Mira's priorities. No white-room; lived-in choreography from shelf to walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve path disappearance before fade) signaled early tightens via seed conjecture, narrowing to release over defeat; agency in transliteration forecloses old path. Accumulative deepening reweights with legible cost in "grief she would carry forever." One pivotal pressure point suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative paths emerges from particulars (glass emotions, bird seeds, crystal light) without statement; final image non-literally answers via "paths become birds, seeds, light." Resonance recharges seeds/geode, embracing ambiguity of not-knowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature biases toward wonder-grief (prismatic ghosts, cheerful gloom). Rhythm modulates from descent's pulse to emergence's lantern; purposeful compression teaches pattern, pays in closure poise. No leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "grief and wonder could share the same breath" advances character/atmosphere/theme). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in seed transliteration without overwriting. Final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion-transliteration meets path-metaphor in geode-seeds, transforming loss into generative release; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from glass-to-seeds arc; no template echoes.</comment>
