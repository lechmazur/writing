<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied scent memories (lavender weeping, rain locking room); cautious trait yields to earned grief at vial uncorking, revealing values hierarchy with tearful cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density builds to RR closure in vial scent/tears with emotional cost legible in "Tears came, and she did not fight them"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse/micro-setting (UV enclosure, panes) constrains vial/plant interaction and charges final image ("crystal shadows within crystal glass"); sensory hierarchy (amber lantern, purple glow, resinous scent) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand scent-tears) deepens via Dr. revelation and vial choice under accum lens; agency in smelling forecloses fear with embodied tear cost, but external pressure brief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (scent as ghost-memory > words) emerges organically from vial/plant particulars; final image (vial to heart, dawn) reconfigures loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scent-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic control peaks in vial beat ("resinous, slightly sweet"); brief dialogue natural/subtextual (funding reveal).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy tears, flowing shadows); propulsion weaves sensory propulsion without overwriting in climax vial scent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh Silphium/scent-memory synthesis transforms extinction trope; risky poetic tone (crystal shadows motif) heightens stakes organically, inevitable at grief reconfiguration.</comment>
