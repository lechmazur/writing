<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in rope-tracing embodiment; contradictory aliveness in Jerome's desperation compels sharing. Woman's challenge elicits micro-choice smile, earning relational deepening. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("terrible clarity") slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rope to poem to exchange, landing Charged Poise RR in grotto-filling presence. Cost legible in foreclosed isolation via communal layers. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's warm clay and glow constrain writing/sensing, mirroring internal accumulation; starlight frames woman's entry and final image. Rope as micro-setting charges closure with Jerome's echo. Sensory selectivity reflects post-beings sensitivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via woman's sensing deepening pattern recognition. Agency in handing rope narrows to shared presence; cost felt in vulnerability of exchange under beings' gaze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of choice-layers emerges organically from rope/poem/exchange, reweighting time as sediment in final image without statement. Subtext in "play is honest response" invites ambiguity on ethical weight. Resonant non-literal answer via accumulated presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual bias toward object-textures; dialogue subtextual ("ethically playful?") advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation builds lyric density without head-hopping. Distinct voices: Marcus poetic, woman direct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action; rhythm varies with pressure, lyric metaphors purposeful under textural lens. Minor overwrite in "luminous threads" strings avoids muddle but borders density excess in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentle aliens awakening object-empathy transforms escape-rope trope into time-texture premise. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable; no derivative templates, bold in quiet post-apocalypse.</comment>
