<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via cloud namings revealing grief-as-gift contradiction; micro-choices like noting "Nimbostratus furiosus... Like her" compel endurance with isolation cost; final completeness earned without epiphany dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as cloud observations density-build to nacreous CR repricing tether snap as wholeness; orientation anchored by gondola intro; cost legible in "complete within the space you occupied."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Telescope and gondola constrain observations/choices, charging final image; barometer tick and frost sensory-filtered via POV urgency; nacreous shimmer mirrors transcendence without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (engage sky memory) deepens accumulatively through namings narrowing to acceptance; agency in cataloging endurance forecloses old life; isolation cost viscerally felt in drifting sway.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of archival sky emerges via particulars, culminating in non-literal "speak back" answer reweighting disconnection; ambiguity in madness/grief lingers authentically; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cloud-emotion perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation in short catalog beats under reflective pressure; diction controlled, biased to meteorological lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in namings; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (clouds as griefs); read-aloud rhythm breathes with accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cloud-emotion premise fresh synthesis of meteorology/grief, transformed via father's theory; gondola risk heightens isolation stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early catalog seed.</comment>
