<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied psychometry ("pressure building behind her temples"); final loading choice earned by causal buildup of grandmother's visions, revealing hierarchy of values (release over retrieval) with emotional cost in tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase to golden room vision; CR closure in "not storage, but something closer to planting" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost legible in projector's "gratitude" and Vera's departing realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth micro-setting constrains climax (loading Simplex despite no power) and charges final image (dust motes as snow); sensory details (nitrate smell, cork walls) mirror internal states through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via visions to force renunciation (release over retrieval); cost felt in tears and foreclosed retrieval path, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as "planting" emerges organically from filmic visions and projector act; final image ("doors close not as endings but as embraces") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (spatial architectures from objects); rhythmic modulation heightens visionary immersion without leakage, diction biased to filmic psychometry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("hushed thunder" reprises softly); minor metaphor density in visions ("vines in a luminous jungle") fits lyric accumulative mode without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry-on-celluloid premise transforms film-trope archive into love-cistern architecture; risk of visionary spatiality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grandmother's 1959 embedding.</comment>
