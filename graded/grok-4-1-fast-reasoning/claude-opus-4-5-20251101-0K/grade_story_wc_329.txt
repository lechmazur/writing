<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like heart-signaling amid statue's climb, reveal contradictory fear/defiance; final swell earned by prior softness constraint. Contradictory impulses act in scene; change confronts flaw of whisper-dissent with visible cost in statue confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers builds to cadence shift in statue freeze/crack; on-page RR/CR via resonance overload reconfigures control with conceptual cost ("silence had just ended"). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky-bridge and orchard constrain choices (ladder climb, soft volume); recurring dust/stone charges final upward blossoms. Sensory selectivity (rotting fruit, frost) mirrors internal wildness; body/tool (violin, shell) as micro-setting enables tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissent via soft illegal song) tightens via statue ascent and heart signal, forcing swell that forecloses recalibration path; agency in rhythm choice narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in cracking statue and motionless aftermath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unregulated beauty emerges implicitly via cicada shell reprise and resonance overload; final image ("apple blossoms falling upward") non-literally reweights mechanical premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (music frequencies, heartbeat as instrument); rhythmic control modulates from whisper to swell, heightening pressure. No head-hopping; diction biased to Mira's folk-wild lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (cicada husk) integrate without muddle in peak statue-crack beat. Minor paraphrase in reflection ("uproot everything") but no loops touching closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-policing statues, heart-rhythm code, resonance-as-freedom transforms dystopia trope; risk in non-violent climax (song cracks stone) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via shell motif.</comment>
