<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's face-blind geometry mapping and deliberate brick-by-brick empathy are vividly embodied in her methodical process; micro-choices like counting stones and precise sketching reveal values under subtle pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the pivotal sketching realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to CR closure: "not closure, but witness" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of expired statute and late recognition, legible in final ascent image. Orientation anchored immediately in descent; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry's mist and flooded pit constrain spot choice and evolve causally (curls ankles, thickens, lifts), mirroring internal hush; sensory hierarchy (gray sky reflection, gravel steps) biases through Clara's geometric gaze, charging final "granite and water" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reconstruct truth signaled early via notebook; accumulative deepening in unifying opposites realization narrows to human face, foreclosing monster view with cost of no legal justice legible in "statute...expired." Agency in persistent sketching endurance tightens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "truth...architecture" and witness over vengeance emerges organically from bone-mapping particulars and opposites unification; final "Elena...who had walked into mist" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration reweighting cold case premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with distinct perceptual signature in bone angles and measurements; rhythmic syntax modulates from measured descent to fierce sketching propulsion, diction biased to geometry without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms (short mist sentences to long reflective cadences); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors— "pencil lance-sharp" coheres with voice; every line advances image or insight, clean to final hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prosopagnosic portraitist unifying witness descriptions into bone-truth transforms cold case trope organically; fresh synthesis of face-blind limits enabling geometric empathy feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in reflective single-scene poise.</comment>
