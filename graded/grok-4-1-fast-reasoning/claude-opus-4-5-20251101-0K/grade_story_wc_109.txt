<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Steady motivation rooted in persistent traits drives the mapping climax credibly; embodied details like bloodied feet align actions with quiet obsession. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the star's final pulse beat, limiting internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building darkness density to Charged Poise closure; map completion reconfigures void as navigable with conceptual cost in "last star exhaled its final gleam." Orientation anchors early; single scene fits scope seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (gales to hush, flaking gold) filters through oracle's perceptual bias; booklet as micro-setting constrains tracing choice and charges final glowing image. Details evolve causally with star's dimming, mirroring internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to chart darkness tightens accumulatively as stars extinguish, forcing agency in faster tracing; visible cost in "fingers bleeding gold and crimson" alters pace at climax. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence mapped into paths emerges organically from particulars like reforming gold lines; final descent image resonantly reweights endless night without moralizing. Counter-reading of void's curiosity adds lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (light quality, hush textures); rhythmic prose modulates from howling wind to thickened honey-time, heightening pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (hush, silence) taught early as pattern; varied syntax propels from ascent to descent without loops or scaffold. Figuratives like "time... thickening like honey" cohere in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic oracle charting cosmic void via light-on-gold transforms apocalypse trope; descent with "confidence of a mapmaker" feels inevitable from prior particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens conceptual stakes cleanly.</comment>
