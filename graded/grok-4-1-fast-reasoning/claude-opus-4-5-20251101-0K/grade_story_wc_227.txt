<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via persistent key-clutch despite discards and memory-matching under lurch pressure; final soul-kintsugi earned by prior causal remembrances confronting daughter's loss with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from narrated marks to gears spinning and charm shattering; RR closure reconfigures brokenness via gold veins with legible emotional cost in "I couldn't save you" whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Statue pockmarks constrain matching method and grab during lurch, charging final gold restoration; acid sea surges pressure choices, with sensory details (hissing, emerald vapors) mirroring erosion theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to forge meaning from oblivion deepens via accumulating narrations narrowing to daughter's crater; agency in pressing forward drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in pain-flowed pattern and transformation trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of golden scars and journal-writing offers resonant answer to brokenness premise, reweighting uncertainty without moral; emerges organically from memory-quilting particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct alchemical perceptual signature filters pockmarks as memory-stories; rhythmic modulation (short gasps in crisis) controls pressure, with stable single-POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in climax (charm shatters, gold pours) propels without loops; varied syntax and coherent metaphors (hungry fingers, kintsugi) maintain clarity under peak transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pockmark-to-scar matching for soul-kintsugi synthesizes alchemy/memory uniquely; risk in reflective method heightens closure stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
