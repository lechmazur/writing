<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's contradictory impulses shine in "trembling certainty" and lowering defenses to provoke confession, earning the final stance; Sandra's crack from "composure to calculation to something rawer" reveals motive under pressure. Minor diagnostic label-speak in phobia list slightly undercuts embodiment without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly through because/therefore chain (DNA → shell coordinates → library → photo reveal → confession); closure DC lands decisively in "confession spilling like rust... Marla recorded everything" with relational cost legible as Sandra crumbles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "stars pressing down like cold witnesses" and "iron bones groaned in the wind" mirrors internal freedom and charges final "stars bore witness"; subtle constraint via corroded shelves hiding Marla, but no direct tactical shaping of climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity via confession) tightens causally at photo reveal, forcing Sandra's options to narrow; Marla's agency in "outwit me... once" drives peak with visible cost in exposed vulnerability and recorded evidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of betrayal's paradoxical freedom emerges organically from particulars like shell's encoded truth and child's cast; resonant CR in final "breathing freely... transformed by a betrayal that... set her free" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in phobia-filtered trembling details; dialogue carries subtext and goals, e.g., Sandra's "I raised you" evasion meets Marla's pursuit, distinct voices intact under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "stars pressing down like cold witnesses" and "rust from corroded metal" slightly muddles peak density but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double phobias with encoded shell and child's cast decrypt transforms kidnapping trope; outwitting via overlooked vulnerability feels inevitable from adaptive traits, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
