<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's resilient positivity acts in contradictory impulses—cheerfully acknowledging failure risk ("This might not work") while upending the hourglass—earning her endurance and splitting cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: phosphorescent patterns deepen density to pattern break at hourglass inversion, yielding Charged Poise closure with legible splitting pain as cost; orientation anchored immediately in ferry vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's luminescent water and reflections constrain the pivotal pour and charge final harbor transition; sensory hierarchy (salt/static spray narrowing to starlight) mirrors Mara's dawning comprehension without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (passenger arrival via timeline merge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern alignment and radio voices forcing her pour; agency forecloses vanishing path with on-page splitting cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time-as-net theme emerges organically from hourglass/light patterns, reweighted in final starlit sand image offering non-literal answer to trapped souls; purposeful ambiguity in Mara's wholeness lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (impossible treated as "any other" evening) modulates cheerfully under stress; rhythmic diction ("clocks run sideways") sustains lyric texture to charged closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring pattern accumulation, but minor overwrite in "phosphorescence that traced... like a map" slightly blurs peak grotto immersion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry ghost lore via time-net/hourglass mechanic risks bold timeline split payoff, transforming tropes through Mara's endured fracture into inevitable "work to do" poise.</comment>
