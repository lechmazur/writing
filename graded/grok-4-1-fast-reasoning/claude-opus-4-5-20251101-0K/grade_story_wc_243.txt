<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's contradictory tears-laughter embodies haunted realization, earning covenant commitment via life's "gently thorough" work as foreclosed ignorance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of letters, locket, Keeper dialogue reconfigures purpose in Charged Poise closure ("began to write... one small truth"), grandmother's photo as constraint.</comment>
