<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness concretely enables fractal touch-based art and discovery, with actions aligning to her trait-driven motivation to preserve knowledge. Interiority embodied via fingertips on coin and bark shows competence balanced by limits. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting depth, but final endurance of carrying secrets earns change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin indentations cause deepening discoveries to book, culminating in CR closure where Elara walks away reconfiguring limits as doorways amid tree's destruction. Orientation anchored early (Elara in Great Oak night before demolition). Cost legible in final image of condemned oak waiting in stillness as she departs with secrets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree trunk library as micro-setting constrains via carved chambers and panels unlocked by touch, charging final image of groaning structure. Sensory hierarchy touch-dominant reflects Elara's bias, with starlight and bark textures integrated into action. Recurring coin/tree grain evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to retrieve hidden knowledge before demolition signaled early, tightens via coin-guided path narrowing options under time pressure. Accumulative escalation via deepening fractal patterns reweights to conceptual realization. Agency in touch-micro-choices forecloses inaction with cost of tree's erasure felt in final dawn shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of limits-as-doorways emerges organically from touch discoveries and scholars' failed sky-mirroring, with CR final image reweighting blindness/knowledge without moralizing. Coin and manuscript particulars recur to charge resonance, inviting ambiguity on transcendence. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question answered non-literally in carried secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with touch-perceptual signature (e.g., "fingertips across the coin's surface") biases noticing fractally. Lyrical voice modulates rhythm with intensity, compression purposeful in dying light. No head-hopping; diction controlled, reflecting artist's textured worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punches in discovery beats, breathing expanses in reflection); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion peaks in "fingers moved across the ancient copper," weaving action/image seamlessly. Minor repetitive "felt" stems avoided escalation to artifact via spread and purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's touch-decoding of fractal coin/tree transforms trope of hidden knowledge into fresh synthesis of blindness-as-sight. Bold premise follows implications to CR without retreat, with risk-taking in accumulative texture heightening stakes. Inevitable in hindsight: removal breaks logic of tactile portrait and limits discovery.</comment>
