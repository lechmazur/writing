<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in drumming despite tears, earning the release of Elias with felt loneliness cost; interiority particular via spine-altered frequencies and rebellious micro-choices. Final endurance of solitude reconfigures her stakes authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to RR closure ("His dream was alive now"), with conceptual cost legible in "the space in her mind where he had lived growing quiet." Orientation anchors early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Garden sculptures and lagoon constrain drumming choices and charge final image ("she could hear Elias in its shimmer"); sensory hierarchy (frequencies only she feels) filters through Mira's altered POV, evolving causally with rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (animating Elias's dream) tightens accumulatively via responsive lagoon/sculptures, forcing release; agency in drumming forecloses fusion path with on-page cost ("felt him leaving her").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-enduring-resonance emerges via particulars like whalesongs weaving Elias's lullaby; final image ("sound wave garden would keep breathing for him forever") offers non-literal answer reweighting entanglement premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (quantum fibers haunting as "dreaming in voices"); rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise at climax without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Each surface answered in its own voice" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, minor figurative density in climax purposeful and coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum entanglement and sound-encoded matter transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure's inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
