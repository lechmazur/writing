<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like clutching the shell and pressing palm to glass; final realization earned through memory patterns constraining her writing choice with exhaustion cost. Contradictory impulses (homesick ache vs. forward conduction) act simultaneously in the dawn beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to dawn CR closure ("homesickness... longing to carry forward") with legible cost in "exhaustion... settling into her bones like snow." Orientation anchored in opening line; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spire, lake, and shell constrain choices—700-step climb, palm/vibration press—and charge final hum/image; sensory hierarchy (cold glass, honey dawn) mirrors internal spiral without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduit for symphonies) signaled early, tightens at dawn reversal where light forces fortune-writing; agency in descent forecloses return with exhaustion cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forward-carrying emerges via shell/memory spiral reweighting homesickness in CR ending image; resonant without statement, counter-readings in hollow fortunes avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias (cryptic frequencies, mirrored illusions) distinct; rhythm modulates from hush to dawn spill without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "Dawn spilled... two versions of herself"—varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence in shell amplification serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing, nautilus patterns, and spire frequencies transforms homesickness trope; risky lyric ascent/descent risks heighten closure without gimmick.</comment>
