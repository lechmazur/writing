<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied time distortion ("heartbeat slowed") and glacier-like anger rooted in brother's loss; micro-choices like tracing ink reveal obsessive traits under pressure. Backstory reflection anchors present revelation without flattening stakes. Minor flaw: reflective block slightly exceeds 20% ideal, but tilts forward resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink observation builds density to time-slow revelation ("faces within the chaos"), yielding Charged Poise closure as she rejects taming by time with felt cost of endless hunt. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Seren post-eclipse encampment). Single scene coheres without shards or transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wind-flapped shelters, red sand, ink tendrils like "frozen lightning") filter through pattern-obsessed POV, constraining choices (packing amid erasure). Canyon mouth charges final image, mirroring impermanence. Recurring wind subtly evolves, erasing traces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode time distortion) signaled early, tightens via ink's fade and faces revelation, narrowing to hunt nomads with conceptual cost of curse's persistence. Agency in deliberate observation/endurance forecloses regret path. Escalation accumulative, not reversal-heavy; cost legible in "seething rage."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of crisis-preserved fear emerges organically via ink's memory, reweighted in final image where hunter masters time's "cold honey" flow. Subtext in ink faces echoes brother's doom without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns in dust/ink); lyrical diction ("seconds became hours... mote of dust suspended") modulates serenely under stress. No dialogue; voice rhythmic, biased to ephemera. Elisions purposeful, paid in revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy time-slow beats vs. flowing descriptions); metaphors consistent ("spider silk," "honey-thick") without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak ink fade. Propulsion peaks crisply at "time snapped back."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ink-as-crisis-memory with time-hunter albino transforms trope of lost loved one into conceptual chase. Risky lyric accumulation pays in inevitable desert departure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
