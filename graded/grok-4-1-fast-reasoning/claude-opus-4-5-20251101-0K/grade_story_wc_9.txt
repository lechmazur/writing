<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in ritual choices like touching moments flooding "warm water"; final restoration earned by prior desperation and micro-choices under exhaustion, with contradictory hope/madness acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from cards blooming to door opening; on-page RR closure in drawing moments with weeping cost legible in "She understood now that time had not been stolen"; orientation anchored early in glade climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Midnight glade and cloud sea constrain ritual (grass for cards, ladder descent); recurring cracked saucer charges final image in pocket, mirroring internal fault line; sensory hierarchy (jasmine/ozone/grief) reflects Morrigan's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim lost time signaled early, escalates accumulatively via card door formation narrowing to recovery; agency in unfastening cord forces trade-off with cost felt in embodied weeping and transformed self-understanding at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked time in motherhood emerges implicitly from particulars like suspended fireflies and amber hour; final image of tracing hands "never forgetting again" offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "divination was not prophecy but archaeology" and biased noticing (stars "close enough to wound"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure, stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines like "time sliding past her like she was made of glass" advancing emotion and image; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in glade description pattern-taught without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy as time archaeology in cloud glade transforms motherhood trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric design inevitable in hindsight via saucer-card-door progression heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
