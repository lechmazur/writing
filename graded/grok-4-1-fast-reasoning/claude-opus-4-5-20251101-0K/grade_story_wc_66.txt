<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Helena's motivation as copyist roots her compulsion to revive stories through dust, shown in hands-on dial work and micro-choice to continue amid noise; interiority embodied in breath catching at fox. Minor slip: reflective backstory slightly abstracts initial drive without full present tilt. Endurance of isolation costs visibly in alcove life, earning closure stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to broadcast interruption to sign-off, with CR closure in "dust was stirring" reweighting famine premise via felt patrol risk. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Helena's alcove post-famine). Noise beat tightens via micro-turn, one sufficient escalation; mist constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and ember alcove constrain broadcasts (thick mist cloaks signal), charging final image as it dissolves into dawn patrols. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: radio glow, fox noise over visuals. Micro-setting (dial, mist) guides choices without tourism; thistled calm tone tensions hidden resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast stories undetected) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via patrol proximity and noise reversal narrowing options. Agency in frequency adjustments and continuation forecloses easy silence with isolation cost. One tightening (fox interruption) reweights knowledge of immediate threat, legible in "hands steady on the dial."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unextinguishable memory emerges from dust motif shifting via broadcasts to "dust was learning to remember," offering non-literal CR answer to famine without moralizing. Resonance in final image recharges shepherd tale breadcrumbs. Subtext in song-code elision invites reflection on dissent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (music architecture in hands, dust particles); rhythmic control modulates from calm weave to tense pause. Whispered "Dust remembers" anchors voice texture. No head-hopping; diction biased to symphonic memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "dial was secretly luminous" advances setting/plot/character). Varied rhythm propels via short interruption sentences; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs. Final "memory... banked, waiting" images closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pirate broadcasts coding classics into dust-stories transforms dystopia trope via non-obvious synthesis (famine breeds hidden symphonies). Risk in mist-patrols heightens ingenuity; fresh CR ("dust had learned to speak") inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
