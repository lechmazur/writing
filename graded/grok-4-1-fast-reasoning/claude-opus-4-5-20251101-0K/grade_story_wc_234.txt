<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—calibrating science amid emotional dread—act in scene, embodied in trembling hands and pocket-sun flare; final choice to go transformed is earned by Theo's pressure and her prior work devotion. Voice distinct in scientific-romantic idiom vs. Theo's intimate directness. No unearned epiphanies; realization builds from micro-choices like handing the shell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via dialogue beats to CR closure in "Something recalibrated inside her," reweighting presence as attention with emotional cost legible in her cracked voice and resolve shift. Single scene, orientation anchored by nexus and pocket-sun in first paragraph. No causality breaks; whisper incites pivotal deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via heat shimmer and pulsing glow that halo actions and mirror emotional intensity; nautilus columella charges final image as handed-off symbol of central column endurance. Sensory hierarchy (crackle, sulfur, twilight purple) reflects Mira's priorities, integrated into work beats without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (leaving to capture presence vs. relational loss) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through Theo's whisper narrowing options to revaluation; agency in her endurance to go but redefined closes with felt cost in recalibrated resolve. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of presence as devoted attention emerges organically from columella spiral and pocket-sun synthesis; final image of shell handover offers resonant CR without moralizing. Theo's articulation ("density isn't in the capture") borders echo but dramatized via prior conflict, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Mira POV with perceptual signature in logarithmic fractals and emotional chemistry; dialogue subtextual (Theo's "I know why" pursues goal, evokes silence). Rhythm modulates from precise calibration to deepened purple twilight cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "Light cascaded through... golden fractals" advances action, setting, theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle in peak whisper beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fantasy alchemy premise (pocket-sun from starlight/fire) synthesizes fresh angle on time-capture trope via columella geometry; risk in quiet CR heightens philosophical stakes, inevitable from early scientific-romantic setup.</comment>
