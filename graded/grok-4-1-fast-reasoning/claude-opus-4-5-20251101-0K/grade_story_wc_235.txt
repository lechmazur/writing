<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction (jealousy as "sharp twist beneath her ribs") driving micro-choices like selecting scrolls and writing; final renunciation of fear earned via prior causal buildup of envy and curse realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from scroll-reading to window-gazing to writing; CR closure lands cleanly in "ready to stop fearing and start writing toward" with legible conceptual cost of accepting sequenced chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Birch bark recurs as constraint/tool shaping writing choice and charging final image; sensory details (crackled scroll, groaning cabin, birch-snow scent) selectively mirror temporal dislocation without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of temporal chaos tightens accumulatively via jealousy beat narrowing to writing acceptance; cost felt in "specific loneliness of knowing your own ending," charging ridge-climb plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-as-narrative emerges organically from scroll particulars to final wind image reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in smile tasting wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of cartographic precision (e.g., "architecture of her sleeping mind"); rhythmic diction modulates jaded reflection to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (e.g., "catch water in a net"); peak realization beat clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-chronicler premise with self-jealousy and pre-dug grave; risk-taking in nonlinear time transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via scroll callbacks.</comment>
