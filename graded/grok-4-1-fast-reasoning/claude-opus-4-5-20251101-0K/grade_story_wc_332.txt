<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation roots deeply in grief-driven obsession, intensifying through failed experiments to compel the desperate roof climb in fog; contradictory impulses of impatience versus "stubborn hope" act in scene. Final endurance—continuing photography despite absence—earned by prior causality with felt cost in transformed grief. Interiority particular via embodied weeping/laughing post-photo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fading dream/refraction failures to fog-blade sunrise photo as CR closure, reweighting premise with cost of "luminous absence transformed." Orientation anchored early in library/islands; single narrative with taught reflection shards fits scope, pattern pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Palette/roof constrain choices, charging photo image; archipelago fog/sunrise mirrors internal fog of forgetting, sensory hierarchy via dawn light filters POV urgency. Micro-setting (palette wells) vitalizes closure; no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream/mother) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as details fade ("hair dark or gray?"), forcing persistence; fog success deepens via agency, cost legible in "heavier than presence ever had" persisting post-photo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: longing as "language...written in wavelengths," resonant CR in final image of "cupped hands finally visible," reweighting absence without moralizing; particulars like palette/journal anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/color observations ("colors that had no names"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to gold-blade intensity, diction character-biased toward poetic longing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "light poured...fractured"); varied rhythm accelerates to shutter press, no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of palette as memory-cipher transforms trope of lost dreams via specific light-wavelength premise; risk of fog-disrupted experiment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
