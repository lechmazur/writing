<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (fear vs. surrender in "growth cannot be commanded") compel the earned final renunciation with visible cost of old self's death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure; leaf at window and dissolving end deliver legible before/after reconfiguration with conceptual cost in "death of what came before."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and rain constrain surrender choice and charge final image ("moss beneath her feet pulse with welcome"); selective sensory hierarchy reflects Vera's botanical bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resistance tightens accumulatively to stance crystallization; one deepening (leaf as deliberate summons) forecloses denial with felt cost in painful bark patches and foregone meals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-to-growth emerges organically from particulars; final image of dissolving leaf offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting prior resistance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (plant-rooted metaphors like "green threading through her veins"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to lyrical peak without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful figurative layering ("wind through branches" laugh) integrates seamlessly, no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical study into personal metamorphosis transforms eco-trope via specific observations (linden leaf's impossible journey); quiet risk-taking in lyric surrender heightens stakes organically.</comment>
