<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions, like "heart stuttered" at the VALVE CONTROL sign and trembling fingers appraising beads, earning the final renunciation of swallowed silence with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery chain to on-page CR closure; bead-counting realization reconfigures premise with conceptual cost in "weight... heavier but somehow easier to carry," constraint of tunnel darkness shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via flashlight-dependent navigation and charges final image of amber bead catching light; selective sensory details like "boots crunched on gravel" mirror internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
