<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hesitation at the dial, hearing the instrument's unspoken fear, reveals internal conflict and earns her resolute turn, with embodied trembling hands grounding the choice and her final peace as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building revelations (village stagnation → instrument hoarding → release cascade), with CR closure in the crumbling instrument and village reawakening images making conceptual cost (absolved fear) legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora colors and frost constrain her climb and peering action while charging the final descent image; selective sensory hierarchy (light trails via eyepiece) mirrors her perceptual gift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early tightens via instrument's bloated history and dial hesitation, forcing agency in the turn that unleashes flood with her bodily exhaustion as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stolen inspiration emerges organically from village "songs that died in throats" to final child drawing, reweighting premise in CR image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (unspoken words as smoke, light threads) stable in single POV, modulating rhythm from ascent tension to release poise without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in release cascade ("symphony of unborn paintings") propels without loops; varied rhythm survives read-aloud, minor metaphor density in peak unchallenged by muddle or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inspiration-as-stardust hoarded in brass vessel transforms fantasy tropes via her auditory gift, with risk-taking lyric closure (village vignettes) heightening resonance.</comment>
