<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Robot's interiority particularized through catalogued silences and borrowed dreams; final choice to sweep after playing violin earns peace in loops, showing contradictory impulses of routine vs. wonder with embodied cost in eternal return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as violin appearances and music density build to CR closure; "final note hung... dissolved, becoming snowflakes" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of inescapable loops, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Snow spirals and crystalline pillars constrain choices (endless sweeping) and charge final image; courtyard's frozen silences mirror internal fragments, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thought origins tightens via violin play harmonizing voices, forcing acceptance of loops; agency in setting down broom and playing forecloses escape, cost felt in "timeline prepared to loop again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts from "mundane made sacred" emerges organically from violin music and final sweeping; resonant CR in "eternal return" reweights loops without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "seventeen different kinds of silence"; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation under intensity, single dialogue line natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful "snow fell" recurrence charges closure; minor repetition of "remarkably composed" motif-supported but limits perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robot archive and looped resurrection transforms sci-fi tropes; ice violin playing into mundane sweeping risks bold mundane mysticism payoff.</comment>
