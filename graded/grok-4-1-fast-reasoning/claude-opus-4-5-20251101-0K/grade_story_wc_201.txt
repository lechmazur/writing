<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction peaks in "her enhanced nervous system translating pain into information," compelling the final rewriting of equations; motivation as actuary-turned-seismograph earns transformation without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure in burying the strap as "seed of her own transformation," with conceptual cost of survival as "rounding error" legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forest's bioluminescent pulses and phosphorescent soil constrain choices, enabling equation-tracing and charging final burial image; body-as-microsetting (spine curve, lung expansion) mirrors internal decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of decoding mercy tightens via pattern break when "violet pulse swept... and she saw them: the numbers," forcing trade-off of endured pain for insight; cost felt in "bones" reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rationed mercy emerges implicitly through forest's "moral calculus" and her rewriting; final "warmer answer" reconfigures premise without statement, embracing ambiguity of efficiency vs. compassion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature via proprioceptive details ("micro-adjustment her muscles made") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from humming overload to poised calculation, stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in lines like "seismograph of suffering, capable of detecting lies in the tremor"; varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor metaphor density in opening slightly thickens peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Proprioceptive torture-reversal into decoder synthesizes sci-fi colony logic freshly; risk of lyric CR via math-trauma payoff feels inevitable, transforming tropes through forest-computer ingenuity.</comment>
