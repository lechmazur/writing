<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief and internal contradiction in ravine observation, with micro-choices like carrying chrysalis earning the lab shift; motivation intensifies credibly from permanent bonds to scaffolds. Minor therapy-speak in "grief loosens its grip finger by finger" slightly abstracts peak realization without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: foam observation builds to CR closure where polymer membrane reconfigures loss into generative connection, cost legible in "atonement... for years she had spent trying to design materials that defied loss." Two-shard structure (ravine-lab) transitions cleanly; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ravine foam patterns and chrysalis constrain insight choice, charging final membrane image that "shimmered like river foam"; sensory details (swirling foam, dark water) mirror internal states purposefully. Body/setting integration via hours-long watching grounds progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief over separation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via foam insight narrowing options from defiance to honoring; agency in patient watching and redesign forecloses old path with felt cost in wasted years. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of persistent connection emerges organically from foam/chrysalis particulars, reweighted in final membrane without moralizing; resonant CR in "grief loosened into something... almost like peace." Borderline echo in "This was how she would atone" slightly overtells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with chemist-specific perceptual bias (fractal geometries, molecular resonance); rhythmic prose modulates from observational to rhythmic design work. No head-hopping; diction controlled and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (braided/foam); rhythm varies effectively in lab sequence. Minor paraphrase loops in "splitting and rejoining" echoes slightly dull mid-ravine without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer design via river foam and daughter's lens transforms grief trope into specific CR; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
