<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "wept and laughed simultaneously, her chaotically precise mind categorizing each fragment even as her heart broke open," earning the change; interiority particular but minor label-traits ("helix-minded") slightly hedge flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density surge in quaking reverie tightening to Charged Poise/CR closure ("memories entangled... no longer distinguish"); cost legible in self-blurring final image, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon strata and broken mirror constrain setup ("precise angle") and charge closure ("mirror continued to gleam"); sensory hierarchy (geological schematics via engineer POV) integrates perfectly without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-modification for dreams) signaled early, escalates via memory flood under accumulative lens narrowing to entangled cost; agency in interface/modulator use, but no micro-turn beyond density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unified dreams emerges implicitly via particulars (nested memories, earth archive), final CR reweights ("all dreams... one endless human reaching") without moralizing; resonant without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thought in spirals... chaotically precise movements") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in reverie, stable close third-person with no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., mirror setup advances plot/character/atmosphere); overwrought metaphors consistent/voice-led but verge on muddle in canyon breathing; no loops, clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of neural engineering, geological archive, fractured mirror transforms dream trope; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
