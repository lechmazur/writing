<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with contradictory sorrow/hope impulses acting in tears paralleling glacial pace; final micro-choice to sketch earned by subconscious notation reveal; no unearned epiphanies, traits shown via patient scribing and buried music.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories density-build from forecourt cues to news-triggered realization; on-page Charged Poise closure in sketching new measures with legible cost ("terrifying burden"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forecourt as micro-setting constrains via whispers heard only by her and catches tears/rain to charge final luminous image; sensory hierarchy (sub-audible hum, petrichor) reflects introverted musician's bias; details evolve with sunrise, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconfront abandoned dream) signaled early via grandmother cue, escalates accumulatively to subconscious notation deepening that forces stance crystallization; agency in pulling stylus forecloses duty-only path with felt hope-cost; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient dreams emerges organically from particulars like margin notations and tears-to-light; final image reconfigures abandonment as waiting with non-literal resonance; no moralizing, ambiguity in hope's terror lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in musical transcription of hum; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to flooding light; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with lines multi-tasking image/pressure; varied rhythm suits glacial pace, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density ("oil on water") coherent but borders overwrites in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noise-plague world and subconscious notation transforms dream-abandonment trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens emotional stakes without obscuring closure; particular details like brass stylus avoid generics.</comment>
