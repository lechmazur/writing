<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and physicist-specific through quantum metaphors and embodied actions like bead arrangement; motivation intensifies from desperation to committed direction with earned endurance; minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("Hope... equation") borders diagnostic but anchors closure resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from light reflections to bead triangle; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as Marina gathers beads and emerges with recalculated hope, cost legible in foreclosed fear and commitment to Geneva ("Tomorrow she would contact Geneva"); orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto vividly sensory (dripping rhythm, fracturing light) and constrains choices via refracted patterns enabling timeline views; recurring light/beads charge final emergence image; POV-filtered through physicist's pattern-seeking bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for Elise's survival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as bead patterns brighten success timelines, narrowing to Geneva trial; agency in methodical arrangement forces trade-off from longing to action; cost felt in ongoing "constant recalculation" but lacks one sharper on-page reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hope as testable equation emerges organically from trial balloons and patterns, reweighting via triangle discovery without statement; final image of ascent counters gravity with resonant non-literal answer; purposeful ambiguity in timelines invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in quantum/light metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates from serene observation to determined emergence; no dialogue; diction controlled and physicist-apt, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines integrating action, image, interiority; rhythm varies purposefully with scene calm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("peaceful destruction and rebuilding") during key pattern beat slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physicist accessing parallel timelines via grotto light and beads transforms trial balloon trope into tactical tool; risk in serene magical realism heightens stakes; premise follows implications to charged poise without retreat.</comment>
