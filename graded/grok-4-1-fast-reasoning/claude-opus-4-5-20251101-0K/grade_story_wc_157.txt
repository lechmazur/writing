<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's charming rogue traits compel the reveal and teaching moment via his smile and calculated escapes, earning Sofia's commitment; secondary pressure from her questions forces clarification. Minor slip: internal contradictions summarized in backstory rather than acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as insect chaos and revelations densify to Charged Poise closure when Sofia reaches for the seed and Marcus opens the notebook, reconfiguring resistance with Bureau cost felt in untaxable growth. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, clicking mandibles, and battering hawkmoth constrain isolation and charge final chaos image, mirroring defiance; sensory hierarchy (visual wings, auditory clicks) reflects Marcus's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free thought via gardens) signaled early tightens when Sofia realizes her plots as infrastructure, narrowing to commitment under Accumulative lens; agency in her reaching for seed forecloses compliance with legible risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable growth emerges organically from seed, insects thriving post-death, and garden codes, resonating in final "language the Bureau's algorithms would never decode" without moralizing; reweights premise via converging particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Marcus with perceptual bias (calculating angles, rogue heart); dialogue distinct—Sofia direct ("Why me?"), Marcus cryptic/subtextual—advances stakes naturally under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with insect motifs woven into action (mandibles like conspirators); rhythm varies for propulsion, minor figurative density in descriptive beats purposeful without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought-tax dystopia and plant semiotics transforms resistance tropes organically; gourd seed as secret carrier feels inevitable, with risk-taking in coded gardens heightening stakes.</comment>
