<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to distinguish living from rotting houses drives concrete micro-choices like displacing objects; interiority embodied in orris warming her palm and realization shift; earned change in "the house felt alive because she'd made it so," foreclosing neglect with ongoing cost of attention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from documentation to entry and room-naming; orientation anchored early in shore road and Whitmore house; CR closure in sanctification realization reweights premise with conceptual cost of perpetual witnessing, legible in final image of carrying shard toward Jensen cottage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via Marina's bias (scents, silences over visuals) integrates into action; orris shard and displaced objects constrain choices and charge final image; bay sounds evolve from fog-softened spring to full dark, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand house aliveness signaled early, tightens accumulatively through object displacement to realization; agency in patient noticing forecloses indifference path; cost felt in "the trying itself was the sanctification," charging tomorrow's work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of attention as sanctification emerges organically from displaced objects and hush presence; final image of shard mingled with house history offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting creeping normality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in noticing "small erosions" and "shard of hush" stable in third-person limited; rhythmic modulation from descriptive opening to charged realization; purposeful elision of backstory anchors to present orris cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "footsteps absorbed by wood softened with rain"; figurative language purposeful in lyric mode without muddle; minor density dip in opening metaphors ("violet hour," "daydreamed") but rhythm propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned houses as responsive to witnessing via displaced objects transforms trope; risk in quiet conceptual closure heightens theme without gimmick; orris-grandmother pattern inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
