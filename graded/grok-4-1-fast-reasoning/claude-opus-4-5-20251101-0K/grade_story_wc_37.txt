<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scattered memories create concrete internal conflict acting in scene (songs persist despite loss), embodied in trembling hands and instinctive swaddling; final distributed consciousness earned with visible self-loss cost ("remember nothing of herself"). Minor slip: no explicit mid-scene flaw complication, but does not touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rusty song to resonating windows, petal-swaddling, light-web expansion; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost ("price...gift") in final forehead-to-window image reweighting individual/collective. Orientation anchored early (~50 words); single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mica windows as micro-setting constrain choices (palm press reveals memories, swaddling sparks threads) and charge final image (warm, transmitting); sensory selection (phosphorescent glow, vibrations) POV-biased by memory keeper urgency, evolves causally to web-push outward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Elara's agency (song→resonance→swaddle→web) narrowing to communal voices; cost unmistakable in self-erasure for shared tapestry, charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal reweaving from individual fragments emerges organically via mica-trapped memories and voices joining; final image ("threads stretch...another voice") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (songs as seeds in throat, memories slipping like water); rhythmic modulation heightens from uncertain melody to harmonious web, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mica windows...reflecting only Elara's gaunt face and the phosphorescent glow"); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (memories in amber, threads spiraling), zero loops/artifacts even in peak web-build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dying-world fantasy via mica-preserved songs and petal-swaddled light-weaving; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens communal stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early orchard wrongness.</comment>
