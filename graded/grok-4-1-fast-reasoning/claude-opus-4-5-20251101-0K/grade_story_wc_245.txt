<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through skin-absorbed languages and embodied dread at "for one terrifying moment, she felt nothing," earning the final renunciation of neutrality with contradictory impulses acting in the clearing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via intensifying notes to CR closure in "She had touched emotional neutrality... prefers the quiet blaze," with legible cost in rejecting the stillpoint; orientation anchors immediately, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring constrain choices (e.g., "dowse... branch pulled leftward"), charging final image of ring humming toward home; sensory details filtered through blind POV bias integrate seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping stillpoint) deepens accumulatively via melody trail to neutrality's terror, forcing stance crystallization with agency in charting and refusal; cost felt in "one far darker than the absence of light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of feeling's "quiet blaze" over neutrality emerges organically from stillpoint realization, reweighting prior emotional territories in final image without moralizing; resonant via lullaby's evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of tactile/ultrasonic noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from whispers to silence, prose as character in "heart finds absolute equilibrium."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor figurative density (e.g., "silver wire through cloth") in approach risks slight opacity without obscuring closure; no loops, varied rhythm holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind emotional cartography and ultrasonic wilds transforms tropes; stillpoint as "doorway" turn inevitable from particulars, bold sensory premise commits fully.</comment>
