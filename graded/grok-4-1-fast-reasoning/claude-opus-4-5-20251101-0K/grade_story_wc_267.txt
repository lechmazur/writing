<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between grandmother's sacrifice and personal yearning act in scene; bolt-turning choice earned by synesthetic embodiment of pain-as-music and bellhop pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from dust "REMAIN" to fog "BOLT. HOLDS. VOICE." lands DC closure in bolt-turn with legible storm-risk cost; single-scene scope with lens held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic cold as "high, keening note" and frost-veined piano constrain bench-bolt access, charging final grip; POV-filtered details mirror frostbitten internal thaw.</comment>
