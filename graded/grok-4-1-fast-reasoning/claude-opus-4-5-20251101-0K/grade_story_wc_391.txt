<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from impatience to sculpted patience is earned through backstory anchored in brother's death and nightly work, with embodied micro-choices like pausing at ice cracks revealing contradictory impulses. Final endurance of patient revolution forecloses fiery past with felt grief-cost. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of celestial/magnetic images building to CR closure: final viaduct image as "bridge between what was and what would be" reconfigures revolution premise with personal patience cost legible in descent/packing. Orientation anchored by para 1; viaduct discovery tightens stakes. Persistent ice-flow constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake and viaduct constrain choices (amplifies measurements, ice groans interrupt), charging final image where "ice and iron intertwined" mirrors internal shift. Sensory details (breath plumes, thunder-cracks) filtered via mapper's patient gaze, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete moon maps for storm-timed uprising) signaled early, deepened by viaduct find narrowing to precise amplification under Accumulative lens. Endurance agency crystallizes in final measurements with past-loss cost and future unyoking risk felt. Stakes viscerally tie to personal impatience flaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of revolution-as-erosion emerges organically from particulars like lake currents under ice, reweighted in closing "even frozen things remembered how to flow" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from patient process question, resonant via viaduct reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature: mapper's "softly purposeful" gaze on celestial/ice details, rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Diction controlled, syntax reflects patient restraint without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful "patience" recurrence accumulates texture without loops. Minor metaphor density in viaduct ("frozen river suspended") integrates without muddle, propels to crisp final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: moon-tracking predicts magnetic storms for non-violent unyoking, transforming revolution trope via horizon mapper's patient craft. Risky lyric build heightens stakes through erosion premise.</comment>
