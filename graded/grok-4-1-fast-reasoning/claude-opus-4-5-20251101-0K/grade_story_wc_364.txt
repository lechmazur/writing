<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oren's meekness transforms credibly into quiet determination through deliberate actions like testing handholds twice, earning the closure choice to reforge without unearned epiphany; internal patience-momentum shift shows contradictory impulses in the descent beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from silk discovery to mine descent to bargain knowledge to forge relighting; closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with "He relit his forge that night" bearing felt cost of years-long labor, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches and mine shafts constrain descent tactics and enable core-heat forging; Chamber of Roots charges final azure flames image, with sensory details (bioluminescent moss, silk hum) filtered through Oren's calloused priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to end blight tightens causally at bargain—no full cure, but partial resilience tools forcing years-long endurance; agency in offering silk and grafting shows trade-off cost charging "It would take everything."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forged resilience emerges organically from barter and plow forging, final image "azure flames never dimmed. And neither did he" offers non-literal reconfiguration reweighting meekness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in tactile details (calloused fingers, tested handholds); dialogue sparse but subtextual—"Why me?" reveals character; rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "meek doesn't mean weak" advancing character/theme; varied rhythm propels descent, minor azure repetition pattern-taught early without loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blacksmith forging resilience from crystalline roots on floating orchard planet; bartered partial awakening transforms tropes, risk in knowledge-pouring scene heightens stakes organically.</comment>
