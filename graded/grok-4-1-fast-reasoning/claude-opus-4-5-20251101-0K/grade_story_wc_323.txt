<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vara's interiority embodied in aching eyes and chain's weight reveals navigation expertise clashing with new sight; shift to star-anchoring earned via Tessek's lesson, foreclosing old limits with generational cost. Minor smoothness in epiphany ("horizons unfold") lacks deeper contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chain motif to star patterns resolving into geometry. CR closure lands on-page as Vara sets down chain link—"a relic of old thinking"—repricing human navigation with conceptual cost of "oceans of understanding" beyond, felt in final tracing of edges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Benthic city's crystal dome and refracted starlight constrain lesson by enabling edge geometry sight; recurring light-bending charges final image of unfolding horizons. Sensory hierarchy (Vara's pilot bias notices currents/symbols) integrates purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn star navigation) signaled early, deepens via "watch the edges" glimpse narrowing old instrument ways; agency in "show me" and chain drop forces renunciation with felt cost of "years...generations." Minor abstractness in stakes lacks visceral tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries dissolving emerges organically from chain-to-stars shift and edge motifs reweighting human "small pond"; final image offers non-literal resonance ("every horizon opens into another") without moralizing. Subtext in Tessek's "sorrow" adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Vara's perceptual signature (pilot reads "currents...coastlines" in alien symbols); dialogue subtextual ("you have stopped anchoring") advances realization. Rhythm modulates from descriptive entry to terse peak ("The horizons...unfold").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "starlight dance and bend through the water"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation ("mathematically precise gestures") in opener fits voice but risks drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea aliens using ocean as star lens transforms first-contact trope; risk in "edge geometry" payoff feels inevitable from Vara's expertise, heightening cosmic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
