<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied scars "humming" and contradictory fire embrace; final endurance of legacy earned via sand collection and letter response. Micro-choices reveal values under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sand grains to realization "become the vessel," delivering on-page CR with conceptual cost of harmonizing destruction. Orientation anchored early in lagoon; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand constrain choice (collecting, grafting) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (teeth hum, boots imprint) filtered through firefighter bias. Environment mirrors transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing) signaled early, deepens via accumulative realizations to Charged Poise; cost legible in foreclosed extinguishing path, felt in scars' hum. Agency in endurance tightens under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-song emerges from particulars (sand, coin, kelp); final image reconfigures fire from destroyer to container without moralizing, resonant CR reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heat/memory motifs; rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity. Stable single POV with clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels from observation to epiphany. Coherent metaphors (sand "gracefully alert") enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy into lyrical transformation; volcanic garden as scars' song risks bold lyricism heightening stakes organically.</comment>
