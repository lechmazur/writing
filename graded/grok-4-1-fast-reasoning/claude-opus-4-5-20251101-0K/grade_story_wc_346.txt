<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in daughter's loss compels the climactic singing with embodied tears and purpose; internal contradiction between salvation consequence and personal lullaby goal acts in scene. Flaw beautifully integrates as loss enabling resonance discovery. Final endurance earned by decades of adjustments, foreclosing normal life with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nested patterns build to resonance discovery tightening toward clock freeze (RR/Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "hands froze at one second to midnight" and inward beam. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; one deepening via vibration insight suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse constrains climb and liminal access; obsidian clock and puppet charge final image with stars in socket. Sensory selective (echoing footsteps, amber/bruise light) mirrors urgency. 9+ gate met: setting shapes adjustments and inward beam payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lullaby via resonance) signaled early, escalates via resisting hands and converging pointers under accumulative lens, narrowing to final calibration agency. Cost legible in personal forfeiture crystallized at knees singing amid tears. One deepening at vibration insight forecloses prevention path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flawed purpose softening endings emerges from puppet loss to infinite lullaby without statement; final image reconfigures premise non-literally with undeniable cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in time patterns ("seconds folded into centuries"); rhythm modulates to hushed intensity at climax. Distinct texture purposeful for awe; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "sun bled into the horizon" purposeful without muddle in peak singing beat; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday clock as lullaby resonator via personal loss transforms tropes organically; risk in time-hush premise heightens stakes to closure image, inevitable in hindsight.</question>
