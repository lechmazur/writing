<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's willingness to risk destroying her melancholic style for "true" sight, earned through the trade; final choice forecloses her old perceptual world with felt grief-cost via reed tongue. Interiority particularized via ghost-weight reed and plant language. No safety-hedging; flaws (colorblind limits) propel awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of loss-offerings builds to CR closure in awakening explosion, reweighting sight with undeniable cost (wilted plants, mournful note from "This is the only piece I saved"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality tight, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Post-phoenix courtyard (warm flagstones, cooling furnaces) constrains ritual (kneel by furnace) and charges final image (broken glass "blazed in cobalt and amber... beautiful because they were broken"). Sensory hierarchy via colorblind POV evolves to explosion; selective, purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (barter awakening) signaled early, deepens via Theo's demand for "self" and plant-reading, narrowing to ritual trade-off; agency in offerings forces renunciation with legible cost (reed vibrates "mournful note"). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; one tightening sufficient, charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in imperfection/cracks) emerges organically from colorblind paintings to post-awakening realization ("paint the cracks in the flames"); final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via glass shards.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (muted tones to "world exploded"); dialogue subtextual (Theo's warning tests resolve). Prose rhythm modulates with awakening intensity; distinct idiom in Mira's cunning corrections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from courtyard hum to "Tears streamed... blue veins"; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (sky "streaked with ash and amber") integrate without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phoenix-resurrection glassblower barters awakenings via reed ghost and plant code, transformed through colorblind painter's imperfection quest; risk in warning ("might destroy everything") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
