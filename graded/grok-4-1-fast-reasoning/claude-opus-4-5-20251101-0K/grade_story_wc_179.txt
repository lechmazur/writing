<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireva's scheming pacifism drives concrete micro-choices like using the music box to awaken cellular memory, earning Thorne's transformation; his resentment shows in clenched fists evolving to tears and release. Contradictory impulses act in the memory surge where pain and ancestral peace clash simultaneously. Minor flaw: Thorne's interiority relies slightly on summary ("understood now") rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sanctuary entry to layered memories, pattern breaks at broken pins' touch, yielding Charged Poise closure as Thorne unclenches fists with felt emotional cost in tears and foreclosed rage path. Single continuous scene anchored early ("sanctuary had no sound"); orientation clear, no disorientation debt. Closure cost legible in "unclenched his fists" line reconfiguring stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary and shifting reality constrain choices (Thorne falls, requires "dance of accommodation"); touch hierarchy sharpens under soundlessness. Music box pins as recurring micro-setting charge final image, mirroring internal release. Sensory filter via Mireva's grace biases notice purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (convince Thorne via memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through box recognition narrowing rage options; agency in guiding fingers to heart forces trade-off release. Cost unmistakable in soundless gasp/tears foreclosing vengeance. One tightening sufficient, charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited peace beyond suffering emerges organically from cellular memories and box lineage, reweighting premise in final "melodies exist beyond sound" without moralizing. Music box shifts from violence symbol to hope reprise. Resonant non-literal answer in Thorne's unclenching recharges generational images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalized through Mireva's graceful perceptual signature ("shifting grace"); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in memory layers. No head-hopping despite brief Thorne access; purposeful soundless compression taught early. Minor register elevation in reflective phrases fits pacifist lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pins were broken, snapped off by someone" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, propulsion strong in memory surge. Purposeful "remembered" chain accumulative, not loop. Minor overwriting in opening abstractions slightly dulls early propulsion, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cellular memory pacifism fresh synthesis transforms ancestry trope via bone-level inheritance and soundless touch; risk in abstract sanctuary paid off in tactile closure. Irreplaceable frame: removing shifting reality breaks logic. Bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
