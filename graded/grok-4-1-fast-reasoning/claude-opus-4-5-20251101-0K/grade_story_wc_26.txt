<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's sharp eyes and softly deliberate persistence root motivation compellingly in her dusk-noticing trade, driving the pivotal stone placement with embodied clutch and luminous regret. Internal conflict emerges via regret layered on duty without tidy resolution. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("luminous regret") slightly abstracts peak embodiment, but does not unearn closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from noticing to comparison ("The comparison screen flickered") to shadow confrontation, yielding RR closure in shadow's metamorphosis around stone with acceptance cost legible in final image. Orientation anchors early (library above clouds, Vera's trade). Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library and hope-lattices as micro-setting constrain choices via dusk shadows curling lattices, charging final image where transformed shadow flows "like a gentle current." Sensory selection (translucent walls, luminous fruit) filters through Vera's priorities. Vivid, purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope shapes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tracking shadows to video proof and stone offering, narrowing options with deepening knowledge of shadow's grief-nature. Agency in kneeling/placing stone forecloses consumption path with felt preservation cost. Escalation coheres under lens, but abstract world-stakes slightly dilute visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief-metamorphosing-to-guardianship emerges organically from shadow's shift ("suggestion of flowing water") reweighting preservation premise without moralizing. Final image resonates non-literally: shadow curious "keeper of what was alongside what could be." Complexity embraces irreversible loss amid hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (dusk-noticing bias) modulates rhythmically under pressure, diction controlled and lyrical ("shadows that stretched across the floating shelves"). No head-hopping or withholding; elision absent. Voice particular, prose as character via deliberate poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., stone intro anchors backstory while talisman); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loop in "softly deliberate" repetitions and "luminous regret" slightly dulls peak propulsion, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, unbound shadow-grief, and river-stone anchor transforms preservation trope via specific world-logic and metamorphosis turn. Risky lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, premise commits fully to cloud-library implications.</comment>
