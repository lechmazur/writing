<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with trembling hands and micro-choices like adhesive analysis revealing machinist traits under pressure. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. pursuit) act simultaneously, earning her final resolve. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("machines weren't neutral") edges below exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density (envelope → adhesive → decoding), culminating in CR closure where photographing/resealing reconfigures truth-telling with safety cost legible in "built enough alliances." Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in amphitheater crouch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic breathing amphitheater constrains (sulfurous light for decoding) and charges final exhale/image of emergence, mirroring emotional shift. Sensory hierarchy (cold chain vs. warm air) filters through machinist POV; micro-setting (fissures, marble) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover grandmother's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through agency-driven deepenings (adhesive test narrows knowledge). Cost visible in delayed exposure ("when she'd built enough alliances"); one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges organically from cipher/decode, resonant CR in chain's warmth reweighting moral calculations without statement. Particulars (dam villages vs. disgrace) resist tidy morals; final image answers "silence protects" non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with machinist perceptual signature (calibrating mechanisms, cipher links). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; purposeful compression in decoding beat heightens intimacy without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brass links cold despite warmth" advances setting/character/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("measured land; Mira... water") and figurative density in opener (−0.4) dull peak slightly but spare closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist ciphers, volcanic "breathing," and moral engineering transforms tropes; chain's reprise feels inevitable. Risky quiet CR on compassion elevates beyond template confession plots.</comment>
