<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene's motivation rooted in preserved art drives teaching choice; Kira's hunger embodied in "borne the weight of emptiness" compels extension of arm. Kira's quick resolve lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but relationship crucible forces mutual commitment with exile cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds from observation to inscription to shared dance. Closure as Charged Poise in "cosmic verses gleamed...eternal as the tides," reconfiguring Kira with legible exile cost; orientation anchored early in garden exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's "cold stones where starlight pooled like spilled mercury" and jasmine constrain secret practice, filtering through Selene's dancer gaze. Charges final dance image on stones under stars, mirroring internal anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unstealable memory) signaled in Kira's whisper, tightens irrevocably at "Once I begin, we must finish" with province severance cost. Agency in arm extension forecloses return path under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's permanence vs. ban emerges via tide/moon images shifting to "unburnable, unbanning" in final line. Resonant non-literal answer reweights exile as homecoming without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited via Selene's "observing gaps"; poetic rhythm modulates from precise observation to fluid dance. Dialogue subtextual ("write on skin") advances ritual with distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in "silver fire tracing paths across mortal skin"; varied syntax propels from setup to climax without loops or muddled metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm peaks in inscription beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia ban, tide choreography, skin-verse transforms memory trope; risk in permanent anchoring heightens stakes organically through ritual world logic.</comment>
