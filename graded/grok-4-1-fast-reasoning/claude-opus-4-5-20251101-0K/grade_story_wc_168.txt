<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction peaks in paralysis at the clearing, where desire to scatter battles final admission of loss; embodied via skilled footwork amid exhaustion and thumb on crack compels earned release with visible emotional cost. No therapy-speak; firefighter lens particularizes grief without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: reflective density tightens to CR at "He understood then what he'd come here to do," reweighting loss via on-page scattering with cost in empty box carried forward; orientation anchored by second paragraph; single-shard climb resolves legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit scars "like rivers of melted wax" and exposed roots constrain skilled navigation, mirroring internal burn; clearing/planets charge final ashes sparkle and descent image without overt symbolism; sensory hierarchy (tactile path, visual glow) biases via firefighter perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scatter/release grief) signaled early deepens accumulatively via paralysis reversal; agency in opening pouch forecloses denial path with cost felt in "hard softness of grief" settling; pressure coheres to universal pain realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of scarred endurance emerges via box/crack particulars shifting to "Something broken, still held"; final image reconfigures bargain premise non-literally without moralizing; subtext in indifferent planets tensions sincerity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalizes via firefighter perceptual signature ("body remembered... even when mind wanted to stop"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in descent; purposeful compression of reflection anchors to concrete cues like crack-tracing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "ashes... sparkled like the meteors Celia had loved" advance image/emotion/closure; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (burn/crack); propulsion peaks in release beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter scars/box crack transform grief tropes into "pain already... universal" via planetary indifference; quiet CR risks bold lyric closure heightening stakes; no derivative echoes, inevitable hindsight via bisected flower.</comment>
