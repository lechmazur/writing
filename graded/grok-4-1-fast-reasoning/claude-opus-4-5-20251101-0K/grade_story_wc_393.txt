<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Marcus's motivation rooted in guilt compels micro-choices like handing over the heart and planning a letter; internal conflict embodied in "words came out cracked." Ruth applies subtle pressure via diagnosis paralleling his failure. Minor backstory block anchors present but nears BRR ceiling without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from examination to Ruth's diagnosis and light breakthrough. Closure as Charged Poise in final image ("light broke through... melody like forgiveness") with cost ("ghost of its silence") legible on page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's micro-setting (workbench, tools) constrains repair choice; clockwork heart as recurring object charges final melody image. Sensory details (dust motes, ticking) filtered through Marcus's priorities, evolving with clouds parting. Purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deserve forgiveness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Ruth's "gear out of alignment" parallel and light image reweighting options. Agency in resolve to leave "something of yourself"; cost felt in "ghost of silence" and foreclosed path. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-action emerges from heart repair parallel and light motif shifting from Elias's words to real shafts. Final image offers resonant answer ("grace, freely given") reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in "approximate former selves" avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in mechanism/light imagery; dialogue subtextual ("Can you fix it?") advances stakes. Rhythm modulates intensity, diction character-specific. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "turning the clockwork heart over" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. No loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle; final line recharges "vibrant hush."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaplain guilt and clockwork metaphor transforms redemption trope via specific melody/light parallels. Quiet closure risks stillness but heightens resonance. Organic particulars avoid templates.</comment>
