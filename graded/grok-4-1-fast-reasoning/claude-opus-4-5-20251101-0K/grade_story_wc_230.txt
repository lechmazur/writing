<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rational detachment shown in "mathematics of survival" and tree-counting compels shift to sharing relic, with contradictory isolation vs. connection impulses acting in option-cataloging beat; final choice earned via embodied tears at successful lie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as relic unwrap → knowledge → fitting → test tightens isolation stake to Charged Poise closure; "dangerous work of spreading this cure" makes execution cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hanging orchard over ravine constrains isolation tactic and charges final image of "trees held on, roots reaching toward nothing"; sensory wind-song and gray light filter through forager bias, mirroring survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "fractured, yes—but grace nonetheless" offers resonant non-literal answer to truth-vs-choice question, reweighting virus premise through eye/trees images without moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empathy virus forcing truth + glass-eye occlusion in storm-battered orchard synthesizes fresh post-trauma agency angle, with risk-taking in quiet grace closure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
