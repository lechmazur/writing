<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (invisibility vs. leaving traces) acting in her decision to place the letter, earned by tape-triggered memory and foreclosing safe hiding with felt risk of exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from find to memory to sighting to caching decision; CR closure in final image reconfigures invisibility with conceptual cost of risked visibility, legible in "she would leave one of her cached items where it could be found."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed library crawl spaces and pipe chases constrain choices (enable caching, limit visibility) and charge final crawl space image; sensory details like "dust coating her thin shoulders" filter through Maren's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (invisibility vs. curated visibility) signaled early tightens via outage sighting of mother/child, forcing agency in letter placement that forecloses pure hiding with on-page cost of exposure risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of visibility-as-traces emerges organically from caching acts and final realization, offering resonant CR in "visibility was not about being seen... leaving evidence"; no moralizing, complexity in ongoing invisibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in methodical sensory details; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to charged poise, diction controlled and voice-motivated without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "shadows pooling... spilled ink" slightly blurs a reflective beat without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban ghost curator transforms invisibility trope through pipe-chase caching and tape memory; risk in unprecedented letter placement heightens stakes organically to CR closure.</comment>
