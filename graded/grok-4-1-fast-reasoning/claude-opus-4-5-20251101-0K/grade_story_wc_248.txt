<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in "analytically intuitive mind cataloging every shadow," embodying trait with contradiction between arsonist label and self-view as "archaeologist of the desperate"; final weeping under portrait earns change via prior causality, confronting isolation cost without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening revelations (trail to portrait/chest), yielding CR closure in "She would portray this story somehow... Now she had a new one to make," with legible grief cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "darkness with only her headlamp" and "temperature shift," charging final image of "mountain's volcanic heart"; sensory hierarchy reflects analytical POV, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) tightens accumulatively through trail narrowing to personal bloodline revelation, forcing endurance with world's forgetting as felt cost; agency in descent/cataloging coheres pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of generational promises emerges organically from genetic portraits shifting to "they built for you," reweighting isolation in final image without moralizing; resonance from vandalized face's defiance avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-sensing diction like "feel logic before she could articulate it"; stable third-limited POV biases toward analytical details, rhythmic control heightens revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "love so fierce it threatened destruction"; minor metaphor density in grief beat ("melted stone") borders overwrite but supports tone; no loops, varied rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh genetic-visual message transforms lost civilization trope via bloodline premise, inevitable in hindsight from tapestry setup; risk in AR heir frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
