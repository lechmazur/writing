<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in hating the anomaly yet finding comfort there act in scene; final wisdom earned via signal interpretation and transmission choice with persistent uncertainty as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signal fragments densify to Kepler question; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with starlight shift and "couldn't be certain" cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anomaly constrains transmission timing and charges final image via shuddering unbending; fountain pen as micro-setting handled tactilely to link mentor and revision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threshing meaning tightens texturally via trembling hands on clarifying message; agency in composing correction forecloses warfare path with uncertainty cost felt in starlight observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of editing history emerges organically from message overlap and pen gesture; final pen placement offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting past mistake without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cosmic interpretive diction ("electromagnetic whispers," "probability cascades"); rhythmic control modulates from uncertainty to charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "messages travel outward together, overlapping" without figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-fold anomaly enabling history revision transforms sci-fi trope; risk in causal scramble pays off via starlight reconfiguration, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
