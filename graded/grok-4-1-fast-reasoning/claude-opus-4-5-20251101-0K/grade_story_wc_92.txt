<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's vigilance drives precise micro-choices like leaving doors unlocked and placing the quill, rooted in decoded backstory; interiority concrete via angle-reading patience. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during tower placement, reducing embodied conflict depth. Competent endurance fits scope without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sparks/light metaphors builds to Charged Poise/CR closure in tower circuit-completion and messengers departing, with conceptual cost ("foundations cracking," "no lock could close") legible in final descent image. One tightening via blackout-enabled moves; backstory anchors/reflection interleaved without flattening. Orientation anchored early (Maren at Eastern Gate, twilight blackout).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via blackout hiding intrigue and twilight glass panels mirroring borrowed light vs. sparks; sundial/tower charges final image. Sensory selective (shadows "grown teeth," quill "warm against thigh") through vigilance bias. Evolves causally as lamps flicker back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark revolution) signaled early, accumulates density under lens to tower climax narrowing exposure risk; agency in unlocking/placement forecloses Duke's undetected tyranny with felt subtle cost. One deepening via timed blackout; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient friction-sparks vs. borrowed luminosity emerges organically via light motifs shifting meaning in final smile/descent; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing. Sparks image bookends with conceptual cost to silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of deliberate vigilance ("footsteps deliberate," angle precision); rhythmic diction modulates calmly under pressure. No elision or head-hopping; perceptual bias colors setting (keys "heavy," shadows "teeth").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in ascent, flowing reflection); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—sparks/light cohere. Propulsion peaks in tower placement; precise verbs anchor action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lock sentinel decodes sundial angles for counterfeit mint revolution, transforming vigilance trope via coded quill/sundial ingenuity. Risky hush intrigue heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
