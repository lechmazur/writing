<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's motivation rooted in embodied fear (pulsing like second heart) drives micro-choices like clasping the pin despite disgust; advisor's repulsive allure reveals through shifting face. Contradictory impulses act in scene (disgust merges with determination). Final consumption earned by causal buildup; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: summons → funhouse → tools → dream DC where fear shakes, revealing weakness. Orientation anchored early (Vera in funhouse post-resuscitation). Closure on-page with cost (ash-victory taste); one tightening via method suffices. Lens holds to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cursed mirrors trap faces/light, constraining advisor's choice of venue and charging final smiling reflection. Sensory selective (dead leaves on bone, rotting flowers). Mirrors evolve to capture triumph; 9+ test met via final image charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (destroy fear) signaled early, tightens via paradoxical method forcing seduction over hatred. Dream reversal narrows to self-fear weakness; agency in reading/applying. Cost legible in merged hunger and ash taste.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fear's trickery emerges via particulars (paradoxical definitions, mirror reflection); final image reweights (fear smaller, shakes). No moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in victory ash. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (fear as nested thing); voice gothic-distinct ("silk made of spider legs"). Dialogue subtextual (advisor's gain whispered). Rhythm modulates; 9+ test met, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, density high (metaphors purposeful, gothic-consistent like multi-dimensional teeth). Minor overwrite in descriptors but no loops/muddle in peak dream beat. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fear seduced via paradox in cursed mirrors, advisor as fear-carrion; transforms tropes organically. Risky repulsive allure heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight via dream reflection. 9+ test met.</comment>
