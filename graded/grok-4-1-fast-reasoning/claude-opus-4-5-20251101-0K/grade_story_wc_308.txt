<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vessa's interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in reverent stillness; micro-choice of humming reveals hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses subtle in enduring immobility for wisdom. Final smile after decades incurs visible cost (dust cracking), earning minor reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns in birds/harmonics build density to pulse detection and hum's payoff. Orientation anchored early (tower perch, canyon). Closure as Charged Poise in invitation/smile reconfigures stillness with cost legible in "dust crack along the lines of her face."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain choices (immobility amplifies hum) and charge final chorus of bones humming approval. Sensory details (vibrations, dust layers) selective via POV bias toward patterns. Environment evolves with light angle and birds, mirroring internal stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding wanderer via stillness) signaled early, tightens via bird patterns to pulse to hum's success. Agency in non-movement navigation forecloses mobility path. Cost felt in decades' wait, crystallized at climber's arrival charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of motionless navigation emerges organically from particulars (echoes, birds, dust); no direct statement. Final image of climber's ascent and Vessa's smile reweights premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "stop climbing forever."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (patterns in flight/echoes); voice lyrical, rhythmic under stasis pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've come to learn"), goal-driven. Diction modulates intensity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; syntax varies for lyric propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in dust/echo recurrences pattern-taught early, pays off in closure chorus. Read-aloud ear strong, no artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic navigation and bone-tower stasis transforms hermit trope via specific world logic (echo-carved canyon). Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; arrowhead/birds heighten stakes organically.</comment>
