<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minerva's motivation to transmute grief into poetry is concrete and consistent, embodied in tracing walls and cultivating algae; interior conflict layers pain with quiet joy effectively. Endurance of insomnia compels ongoing choices with visible cost in perpetual ritual. Minor slip: emotions occasionally lean toward summary in reflective blocks, but micro-choices like singing anchor them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of memories and images builds to Conceptual Repricing in final postcard realization, reweighting beauty as built work with undeniable cost of longing. Orientation anchored early in shell/home. Single scene fits scope; closure cost legible in "across centuries of longing" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell as micro-setting constrains sanctuary and charges final image, with nacreous whorls and bioluminescent verses reflecting POV priorities. Sensory details (wind carrying voice, sea-silk nest) purposeful and integrated into action. Body/setting mirror internal transmutation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of photosynthesizing pain escalates accumulatively through layered memories to stance crystallization in lullaby, narrowing to shy endurance with felt cost of ceaselessness. Agency in singing/writing under pressure; one deepening in armistice recall suffices. Minor abstractness in stakes before final tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of building beauty from loss emerges organically from particulars like algae poems and coral blooms; final image offers resonant CR repricing mother's words without moralizing. Subtext in shy unstoppable trait adds ambiguity. Postcard reprise reweights premise powerfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (oceanic, spiraling motifs) modulates rhythmically; POV stable and biased toward filtered light/joy. Compression of centuries taught early, legible at closure. Prose texture reflects insomniac mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; metaphors cohere (e.g., "photosynthesize that darkness") without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm breathes with scene. Minor overwriting in "reef-shadow joy" phrasing slightly elevates diction, but fits poetic voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic shell-poet and blossom armistice transforms grief tropes via specific transmutation logic; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
