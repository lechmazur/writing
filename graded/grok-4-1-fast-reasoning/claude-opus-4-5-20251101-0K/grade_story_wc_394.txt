<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zephyr's curiosity drives contradictory impulses against Boiler's practicality, culminating in the earned launch choice with dissolve/transcend cost. Interiority particular via gear-metaphors and transliteration; no unearned epiphanies. Micro-choices like arrow-affixing reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds vision-density to charged poise closure: launch reconfigures yearning with legible risk ("dissolve or transcend"). Orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via coordinates to port. No lens ambiguity; constraint (arrow tip) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Acid sea hisses and kaleidoscope constrains launch choice at port; recurring gears mirror internal yearning to clouds. Sensory hierarchy (caustic mist, whirring) filters via Zephyr's lens. Micro-setting (arrow, workbench) charges transcendence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bell-transcendence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through visions to launch-agency; Boiler protest tightens. Cost unmistakable in "corrosive mist" risk foreclosing safety. Protagonist endurance tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yearning-as-algorithm emerges organically from kaleidoscope particulars, reweighted in silent-but-listening bell image without moralizing. Final action answers "go first" question resonantly, embracing ambiguity of dissolve/transcend. Subtext in arrow's repurposed edge avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (curiosity shapes gear/cloud futures); rhythmic diction modulates to irreverent peak ("absolutely hilarious"). Dialogue distinct/subtextual (Boiler's "nonsense" vs. Zephyr's retorts pursue goals). No head-hopping; elision (bell) pays off in closure poise.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gears meshed with clouds" advances image/stakes); rhythm varies without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle; propulsion peaks in launch sentence. Opening "drunk philosopher" anchors voice to closure cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machine-awakening with kaleidoscope-futures transforms tropes via yearning math and arrow-pierce. Risky irreverent tone heightens launch stakes; inevitable hindsight from "yearning comes first." No derivative echoes; bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
