<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in Mira's love for "dust patterns" versus opening the door, with embodied scars and micro-choice to lift the knocker earning the closure renunciation; Sera's pressure reveals Mira's hierarchy of values without stereotypes. Voice distinct in sparse dialogue. No label-speak flattens peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of ash/scars imagery tightening to RR closure ("threshold...thinner now"), with legible cost in "disturbance" to sanctuary; single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2, no orientation debt. One meaningful deepening via shared scars dissolves options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Charcoal sanctuary, doorknocker, and scars constrain Mira's choice (fading threshold forces knocker lift) and charge final image ("starlight and charcoal dust"); selective sensory hierarchy (cold iron, singing wood) mirrors isolation via POV bias, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. scar-link) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via threshold pulse and Sera's plea narrowing to agency in door-open; cost unmistakable in "encroaching upon every carefully arranged absence," charging poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformative doorways emerges organically from scar-glow and threshold shift, with final image ("doorways...passage in both directions") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting emptiness without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "pregnant pause between connection and isolation"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("teach suffocating to breathe"), distinct idiom; rhythmic control modulates from ritual quiet to breathing expansion, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short sentences in decision: "She stepped aside."); purposeful metaphors cohere (scars as "constellations," threshold as "smoke"); no loops/artifacts dull closure image of "thinner...permeable" threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-keeper arts and scar-threads transforms isolation trope via specific world-logic (invisible threads beneath skin); risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight at "bridges...transformed into doorways."</comment>
