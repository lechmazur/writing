<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via dance decoding grandmother's fear into strength, with micro-choices like deliberate steps revealing vulnerability as armor; minor slip in slightly told epiphany ("Marina understood now") lacks one embodied contradiction in the final port de bras.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from journal fragments to dance revelations, culminating in CR closure where legacy reconfigures fear with conceptual cost in "trembling hands... could still change the world"; orientation anchored early in descent, one tightening via choreography suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab's "green-gray light" and "sediment like snow" constrain deliberate movement and charge final ascent image, mirroring internal decryption; selective sensory hierarchy (tactile steps, bloated journals) reflects Marina's bodily processing without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claiming encrypted legacy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dance's "pirouettes decoded names," narrowing to thematic deepening with felt cost in inheriting fear; agency in choreography forces stance crystallization, but no live option foreclosed on-page caps at band edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as armor emerges organically from journal poetry and dance, reweighted in final CR without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "hangman's dice clicked softly," charging prior particulars with defiant inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature in bodily rhythms ("patterns resolve... in muscle and momentum"); diction modulates from deliberate descent to aching port de bras, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm in dance sequence ("pirouettes decoded names... arabesques revealed safe houses"); figurative density purposeful for lyric mode without muddle, minor scaffold in adjacent "calm defiance" echoes near closure but doesn't dull image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking via dance in drowned WWII lab transforms tropes; risk-taking in accumulative choreography heightens stakes, with dice/journal reprise inevitable in hindsight, fully committing to lyrical defiance premise.</comment>
