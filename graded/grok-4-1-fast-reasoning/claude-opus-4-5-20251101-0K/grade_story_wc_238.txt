<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in past failure compels the climax apology with embodied cost ("words that had burned in him"), earning change; Eleanor's ghostly traits shown through conducting fingers and tearing laugh distinguish her voice. Minor slip: "gossip-column exorcist" label leans tell over early show.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore: past failure → archive search → apparatus setup → generator activation traps demon (DC) with legible emotional cost in "I'm sorry" during climax. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene tightens once meaningfully at electromagnetic pull.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's dust/shelves and flickering lights constrain ritual setup; orchard's impending chainsaws charge final image, mirroring Eleanor's anchor loss and pressuring dawn deadline. Sensory hierarchy (cold air, fluttering sheets) filters through Marcus's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free Eleanor via apology/ritual before dawn) signaled early, tightens at generator hum forcing demon emergence with agency/cost; past arrogance confronted forecloses easy doctrine path. Orchard pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles/theme emerges organically from ritual's "not perfect" warning to Eleanor's echoed smile and manuscript tuck; final chainsaw roar reconfigures failure/redemption without moralizing. Metaphors accumulate subtext tying music/demons.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual bias (sacred/scandalous lens on ghosts); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You always advises through metaphors" reveals history). Metaphorical diction/rhythm modulates effectively under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., generator hum flutters sheets, advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor overwrite: stacked metaphors in Eleanor's laugh/voice slightly strain coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Electromagnetic exorcism via perfume bottle transforms tropes organically; unorthodox "gossip exorcist" premise synthesizes faith/science with fresh orchard anchor. Risky metaphor weave heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
