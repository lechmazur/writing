<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esther's contradictory impulses—carrying the "mended deception" versus revealing truth to Elena—act in the revelation scene, earning her choice to share marbles with visible relational cost; Elena's resignation applies targeted pressure without stereotyping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as marble collection density builds to Elena's visit and maze revelation; closure via Conceptual Repricing (deception repriced as devotion) lands on-page with cost in "mended one" line, reconfiguring premise; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hedge maze constrains choices via hidden corners and center bench, charging final image where it "breathed its ancient breath"; sensory details (vine iron bones, clematis arch) filter through Esther's 47-year lens, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmit persistence over luck/destiny) signaled in Elena's slump and tightens via Esther's micro-choice to reveal pot; agency in "Come... Let me show you" forecloses legend with felt cost in Elena's grip on marble; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of devotion over destiny emerges organically from marble fractures as failures/victories; final image of Elena's closed fist offers non-literal answer to "gardens know" question, reweighting luck premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-close POV with Esther's perceptual signature (gardens "know... remember"); dialogue subtextual ("What choice do I have?" pursues resignation, Esther evades then reveals); rhythmic control modulates from calm polishing to charged maze walk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines like "each crack represents a failure... also keep victories" advancing character/theme; minor paraphrase loop in polishing ritual (−0.2) purposeful as motif, no closure touch; read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck premise with cracked marbles as persistence monuments transforms trope; risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes via Elena's choice without gimmick.</comment>
