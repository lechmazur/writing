<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation rooted in career and grandmother drives higher-stakes time-borrowing; interiority concrete via pendant's heat and exhaustion. Earned change in final drawing with visible future-cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from canal walk to cage realization, closure as RR via uncaging echoes with legible cost ("how much time she had left now"). Orientation anchored early; no penalty. Exceptional on-page reconfiguration reweights incompleteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and crystallized-sound cage constrain path and charge climax touch; illustrator bias filters light/sound bends purposefully. Sensory integration mirrors internal yearning without overt symbolism. Final courtyard image elevates to 9-band via constraint test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find echo-place) signaled early, tightens via interrupted cadence pull and time-borrow to uncage; agency forecloses future via exhaustion. Accumulative deepening reweights with on-page cost. Visible trade-off charges ending without resolution coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of completed cadences emerges organically from fossils-to-echoes arc; final drawing offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior extinctions. No moralizing; grandmother's voice completes without statement. Exceptional via particulars and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with illustrator's perceptual signature (feathers/shells as cadences); rhythmic control modulates to stretched time at climax. No head-hopping; diction biased/selective. Clean free indirect supports pressure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm accelerates to uncaging burst, breathes in reflection. No loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors; "sculpting seconds like wet clay" propels without overwriting. Rare propulsion clarity in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-loops, caged echoes, giant's nap transforms extinction tropes via illustrator lens; Aldros smile and voice completion feel inevitable. Risky conceptual premise commits fully without retreat. Non-obvious angle elevates hindsight ingenuity.</comment>
