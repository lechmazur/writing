<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via gardener's hands untangling threads mirrors cemetery reading of intentions; motivation rooted in inheritance compels patient decoding with embodied patience. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the untangling beat keeps it from exceptional; final smile earns closure shift via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from letter urge to border decoding to coordinates revelation; single scene oriented early (silo climb). Closure as CR lands on-page with legible cost in "weight of inheritance" and long-game realization; coordinates tying to cemetery reconfigures premise without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cold metal platform and starlight constrain untangling action, narrowing to fingers by faint light; final "cupped hand beneath the cosmos" charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile rungs/threads, visual stars) reflects gardener POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode intentions) signaled early tightens accumulatively via color reveals to coordinates, narrowing to cemetery action tomorrow. Agency in patient untangling forecloses rushed paths with felt patience cost; pressure coheres under lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient threads (graves, tapestry, stars) emerges organically, reweighting death as "beginnings wearing different clothes" in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like frayed border confession; epiphany earned via decoding struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (roots/bulbs to threads); lyrical diction ("velveteen gloom," "cathedral of stars") modulates calmly, consistent with blithe stance. No head-hopping; voice reflects mind under low-stress reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent ("tapestry no one would ever fully untangle"); rhythm varies for propulsion in untangling beat. Minor overwriting in reflective phrases like "shape of connection" edges down; no loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaver's encoded coordinates in gardened cemetery transforms inheritance trope via patient decoding; final starlight echo risks quiet CR effectively. Non-obvious moral calculus on mortality as clarity heightens stakes organically.</comment>
