<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular to glass artist's perceptual bias shines in "coaxing light into molten glass" and embodied cold adjustments; final renunciation of dependent self earned via decoding's cost, satisfying 9+ test with contradictory beauty/trust impulses acting in canyon waits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from starlit study to frost-decoding CR closure; cost legible in "scorched testament...burned away her assumptions," reconfiguring purpose with undeniable price of old self's death; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain decoding choice and charge final "rainbow fragments" image, per 9+ test; canyon's crystalline spread filters through professional eyes, evolving causally with dawn; no white-room, all tactile and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose amid betrayal) signaled early tightens via frost-decoding reversal changing knowledge; agency in retracing forecloses dependency path with legible cost of "valuable and expendable" realization; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light/dark interdependence emerges organically from ledger-frost parallel, reweighting premise in final climb's "glass-sharp light" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to pauses' meaning via transformation image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with glass-artist perceptual signature ("light poured down like molten gold"); rhythmic modulation peaks in dawn decoding; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and no loops; metaphors cohere to profession (e.g., "white fire across stone"); zero artifacts dull closure image, passing 9+ test with propulsion matching pressure cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost-as-cipher ingenuity transforms betrayal trope via nature/math smuggling link, risking lyric reflection that heightens stakes; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, with canyon patterns charging closure.</comment>
