<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth vs. power) act in ritual prep, earning final realization; embodied veil as grandmother's atoms reveals character under pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing in motivation summary ("steadily unpredictable") noted but does not flatten peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening via ritual avoidance of patterns to CR closure; cost legible in "archive began its slow collapse" and personal transformation. Orientation anchored early at obsidian door; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Veil, sphere, and pagoda constrain ritual (twilight light boundary) and charge final image of veil settling; sensory weave (taste laughter, temples ache) selective via POV bias. Pagoda realization pivots setting's role without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify nostalgia for resurrection) deepens texturally in ritual success with risk of emptiness; agency in chaotic moves forecloses prior systematic failure path. Cost felt in "join the Netharans in...emptiness," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (joy needs sorrow, knowledge transforms) emerges via Netharan collapse and Mira's "anguished joy," reweighting premise in final image without statement. Resonance from veil's evolution avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "atoms of nostalgia" phrasing and biased noticing (veil heavier); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual's timeless "hours or seconds." Stable limited POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (swirling sphere responds to spirals); varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor overwriting in repeated "atoms of nostalgia" motif purposeful but borders figurative density in peak ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of nostalgia atoms and pattern-avoidance transforms forbidden knowledge trope; risk in chaotic ritual heightens stakes organically. Final CR feels inevitable from pagoda beacon realization.</comment>
