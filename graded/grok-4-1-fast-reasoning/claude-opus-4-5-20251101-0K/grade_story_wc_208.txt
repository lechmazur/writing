<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular to sculptor's eye (driftwood parallels slide); contradictory dismissal vs. emerging patterns act simultaneously; final commitment earned via slide revelation with inheritance burden as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of slide layers builds to CR closure ("She was part of this tapestry"); cost legible in reframed life/responsibility at "weight of future connections."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm/archway constrain (shelter forces slide use under lightning); sensory hierarchy (wind hum steadies thoughts); final shadow "like a bridge" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path/understanding post-GPS fail) deepens via slide layers narrowing dismissal to alliance; Accumulative pressure reweights with future burden cost, legible but single tightening limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (solitude to alliance via layered artifacts) emerges organically from slide strata/driftwood; final "In driftwood, eternity would speak" non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with sculptural perceptual signature ("essential shape within chaos"); rhythmic modulation (lyric under storm stress) purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel; figurative density purposeful (pattern-taught via layers) without muddle, but minor elevated diction slips in revelation beat slightly dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom/storm tropes into artifact-network across time; slide layers + driftwood nodes transform into inevitable CR, risk-taking in Accumulative lyric heightens without gimmick.</comment>
