<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's interiority shines in embodied actions like fingers closing on the sextant and stoic wonder checking equations, rooting motivation in past collapse; contradictory fear/determination acts in sketching the plan. Minor reflection on internship slightly abstracts peak resolve but doesn't unearn the final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to equations revealing 30% viability, landing Charged Poise closure in her emerging with plan and sextant; cost felt in foreclosed certainty. Orientation anchors immediately at Gate 47; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sextant piece and floor drains constrain choices, charging final image; sensory details like dripping water and grimy skylights filter through engineering POV, mirroring internal revival. Setting evolves tactilely via mapping, guiding stakes without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (terminal revival) signaled early, tightens via equations' revelation narrowing to viable plan; agency in sketching/mapping forecloses doubt with felt cost of past losses. Accumulative density reweights hope under lens, though internal only limits visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maze/flows theme emerges organically from corridor genius and redirected principles, resonating in final "mazes were built to guide" without moralizing; sextant recharges navigation/hope. Complexity lingers in stoic acceptance of contraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with engineering perceptual signature (air currents, water lines); diction/rhythm modulates from contemplative to resolute, prose textured without filter excess. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated specifics (vaulted ceilings channeling air); minor paraphrase loops in "studied" beats and flows motif don't obscure closure. Rhythm varies, no artifacts in equations peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering on spaceport decay transforms post-collapse trope; sextant/flows ingenuity feels inevitable, risking quiet resolve over action.</comment>
