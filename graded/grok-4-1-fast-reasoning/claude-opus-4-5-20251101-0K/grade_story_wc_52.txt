<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority rooted in embodied actions like the wood warming her palms and joints protesting cold; contradictory impulses to contain grief while carving Viktor's calm-eyed lion earn the stasis of rust-hued peace. Final endurance forecloses drowning in waves with felt cost in preserved moments. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through hands seeping his skill.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving density builds realizations toward Charged Poise closure in the cup warming palms like ash wood, reconfiguring loss with conceptual cost of change over erasure. Single scene anchors orientation early; one tightening via emerging lion crystallizes stakes. Cost legible in "patient as the dead who asked nothing but remembrance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skylight rain constrains gray light washing hands, charging carving and final droplets as lenses containing sky; loft's sawdust and copper pipes mirror internal crystallization tactilely. Sensory hierarchy filters through widow's woodworking bias, evolving with rain's rhythm. Recurring ash wood as micro-setting shapes choices indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief tightens texturally via lion's eyes gaining Viktor's stillness, narrowing to endurance with cost in foreclosed joy for sturdy peace. Agency in gouge against grain forces micro-turns; students loom as felt pressure. Escalation coheres without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's form-change emerges organically from carving lions and "time crystallizes," reweighting premise in final image of Viktor in hands/wood without moralizing. Subtext in contained fear parallels beasts; ambiguity lingers in waves not drowned. Resonant non-literal answer charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in grain-tight wood and rain percussion; rhythmic prose modulates from slow carve to whistling kettle peak. Diction reflects widow's patient hands—specific, biased noticing of musk/sawdust. No elision; voice distinguishes crystallized insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in lines like "each one a tiny lens containing the whole sky" propels with varied rhythm matching carve's patience to closure's poise. No figurative muddle; precise verbs/nouns embody without overwriting. Read-aloud cadence breathes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-taming props into grief-carving workshop transforms widow trope via "harvesting lessons" and rust-hued stasis; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; carving Viktor's calm inevitables in hindsight.</comment>
