<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in sanity-vs-certainty conflict compel the weaving choice; micro-decisions with thread reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "rational enchantment" slightly abstracts peak realization without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via thread navigation to pattern break; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (gallery settles post-knot) lands with legible cost in "tension, not comfort." Orientation anchored early in gallery; single scene coherent. Persistent thread constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery's illusions (tilting floor, mirrors) constrain navigation and charge closure web; tactile thread and visual deceptions filter through architect's perceptual bias. Recurring "realistically imaginary" details evolve causally, mirroring internal chaos to stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, tightens texturally via mirror multiplicity forcing gathering/weaving; agency in final knot forecloses perceptual chaos with strain cost. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-tension emerges organically from thread/mirrors; final "humming through every thread... real, strange, and finally still" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting perception premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "smaller but hers" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (noticing woven attention, illusions as negotiation); rhythmic prose modulates from disorientation to settling cadence. Voice texture particular, syntax reflects architect's mind without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; no loops, metaphors cohere (sinew binding realities). Minor register elevation in "systematic magic" fits voice but borders opacity in one peak sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perceptual architecture and sinew-thread cure transforms Escher tropes via fever-rewired logic; risk in "negotiating back" building heightens stakes to inevitable web-closure. Non-obvious emotional truth in tension-as-home.</comment>
