<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as thief swearing off stealing yet reclaiming sundial for master's sake act throughout puzzle; final heir reconfiguration earned via pawn secret and letter with embodied tear-laughter cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as secret density builds to pawn voice and letter RR (Charged Poise reconfiguring prisoner-to-heir); sky-wrong constraint shapes tactics, legible conceptual cost in "never my prisoner" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cloud-ice pieces and pulsing violet sky constrain puzzle to this moment and charge final "sky remained wrong...gift to embrace" image; selective sensory integration mirrors internal chaos without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to save master tightens accumulatively via time-fold pulse narrowing to correct pawn amid wrong-sky pressure; protagonist agency in sorting yields revelation cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in chaos emerges organically from secrets/thief arc to letter; final dawn indifference reweights premise non-literally as embracing unknown without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with wonder-biased perceptual signature ("sacredly playful reverence"); diction/rhythm modulates from tense sorting to weeping-laughter poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through puzzle; purposeful metaphors like "bruised plums" and "morning frost" cohere atmospherically without muddle or loops, even in peak vault opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky-wrong and secrets-chess premise synthesizes thief-wonder arc inevitably; bold fantasy risks (temporal fold, voice-ice) transform tropes via lived specificity without gimmick.</comment>
