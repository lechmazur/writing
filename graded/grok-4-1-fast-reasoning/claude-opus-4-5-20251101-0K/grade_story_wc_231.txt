<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eccentric traits shown concretely through naming storms, reading silences, and borrowed memories that compel the decoding choice. Final shift from solitary to gifted witness earned via prior memory pressure, with embodied cost in carrying stranger's love. Minor backstory summary anchored but slightly abstracts early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from logbook gaps to full-moon alignment to borrowed memory, culminating in Charged Poise RR where Elias completes the page, reconfiguring isolation with legible emotional cost ("love stayed stubborn"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by para 1, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist as micro-setting constrain edge-standing and memory trigger, glowing planks charge final image of patient waiting. Sensory selection (iridescent surface, curling mist) mirrors internal gaps; POV bias (lighthouse silences) filters perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled para 1, tightens texturally via gaps revelation and memory deepening that narrows to writing act. Agency in observing/writing forecloses solitary path with felt cost of witnessed grief; minor abstractness in early stake declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate silences/gaps emerges organically from logbook omissions and Elias's completion, final image reweights borrowed memories into gift without moralizing. Subtext in Edelweiss (height to depths) resonates via particulars, ambiguity lingers in mist's next witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (driftwood memories, tide-whispers); rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical Charged Poise. Lyrical compression taught early (mist curling), paid off in closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in memory beats); purposeful metaphors cohere around mist/memory without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but supports accumulative texture; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of borrowed memories, alpine flower in sea log, gaps as offerings transforms isolation trope. Risky lyric Accumulative frame heightens closure ingenuity without gimmick; Edelweiss/opal dock pairing inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
