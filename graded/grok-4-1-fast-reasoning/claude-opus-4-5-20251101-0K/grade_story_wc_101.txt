<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots in tradition vs. danger, embodied in bell-ringing despite Yusuf's protest; internal conflict shows in gentle persistence amid exile's fragility. Yusuf's sullenness masks need to belong, revealed when he examines the bell. Minor slip: elders/teens slightly archetypal, but micro-choices earn endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of runs builds to envelope/photo as Charged Poise, reweighting persistence with homeland image's conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (arbor, sanctions). Closure legible in "Mira tucked the photograph into her pocket beside the silver bell."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arbor's clay pillars and ridge constrain gatherings/runs, moonlight/bell charge final image. Sensory selective: salt winds, packed earth, candlelight filter through Mira's priorities. Terra-cotta evolves from weathered witness to hope's site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bonds amid sanctions) tightens texturally via donations enabling runs, Yusuf's danger question forcing tradition's defense. Photo deepens with felt exile cost. One decisive cadence shift suffices; agency in Mira's persistence forecloses forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistent bonds emerges via bell/runs/photo, final image reconfiguring exile as "hope would continue its patient work" without moralizing. Subtext in Yusuf's silence, elders' stories. Resonance from particulars, inviting ambiguity of anonymous donor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Mira's perceptual bias (tradition in sounds/objects). Dialogue subtextual: Yusuf's "dangerous" vs. Mira's reply reveals values. Rhythm modulates quiet intensity, distinct voices in clipped teen vs. elder poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in "footsteps soft on packed earth"; rhythm varies without loops. No artifacts, metaphors coherent (water wearing stone). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: food runs as communion transform exile trope, bell/photo inflections grow from particulars. Risks quiet closure heightening stakes. No close template echoes.</comment>
