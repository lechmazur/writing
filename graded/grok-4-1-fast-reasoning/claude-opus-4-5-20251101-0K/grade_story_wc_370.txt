<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in guilt-driven hiding transformed through paradox realization; contradictory impulses (penance vs. purpose) act in scene via book and dialogue. Earned stasis in decision to return with felt emotional cost. Minor therapy-speak in "enlarged tranquility spreading" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density to Conceptual Repricing at midnight chime, reconfiguring hiding as presence with legible cost in "peace settle into the space where guilt had lived alone." Single scene oriented early (Clement Street, invitation); no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Secret library's impossible shelves and labeled sections ("Contradictions" and "Harmonies") constrain realization by providing catalytic book; clock anchors time pressure. Sensory details (golden light, ticking) selective via Miriam's bias. Micro-setting charges final image through utility door exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearthing wisdom in mistake) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via librarian's insights and book entries narrowing self-view. Agency in acceptance forecloses guilt-only path; cost felt in transformed tranquility. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nestled paradoxes emerges implicitly from book accounts and final reweighting of Miriam's life; resonant non-literal answer in invitation-into-book placement recharges prior hiding motif without moralizing. Complexity lingers in unredeemed grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (absorbing pain like sponge); dialogue natural, subtextual ("You've been watching"), advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation peaks at midnight shift. Minor filter-verb stacks in reflections but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm supports accumulative build; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor register drift to abstract labels ("paradox held her gently") in peak but coherent. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of secret library cataloging paradoxes transforms redemption trope; risk in impossible architecture heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight from invitation seed to belonging payoff.</comment>
