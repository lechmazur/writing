<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong analytical traits shown through acoustic mapping and bishop placement compel adaptive choice during child's interruption; interiority particular via gardener philosophy. Contradictory impulses (control vs. unplanned space) act simultaneously in weaving laughter into melody, earning endurance at closure. Minor lack of deeper flaw complicating peak risks safety-hedge feel, but doesn't touch ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to crowd enchantment, cadence shift in child's laugh adapts to charged poise closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Marina in tidal arcade). Final image of ripples distorting stars reconfigures randomness as dance partner with conceptual cost of imperfect control felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal pools, columns, star reflections constrain acoustics and timing, mirroring internal orchestration; moonlight on bishop charges silk woman's pause. Sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) reflects performer's bias. Final receding water ripples distort stars, evolving causally to recharge theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrated wonder) signaled early, tightens via child's unplanned splash forcing melodic adaptation under accumulative lens. Agency in micro-choice weaves interruption, foreclosing sterile perfection with felt risk cost. Crowd transformation reweights success, but lacks sharper trade-off visibility at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of randomness ordered into beauty emerges via particulars like bishop-moonlight sync and laughter weave, without statement. Final image (Marina smiling into darkness as silk woman calls it "magic") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise with cost of illusion over revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with analytical perceptual signature (geometry, acoustics, patterns). Prose texture via precise diction ("frequencies would carry furthest") modulates with intensity. No dialogue; rhythmic control heightens immersion without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "notes spiraled upward... harmonizing with waves" advances sound, setting, stakes). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (tides as gentle arrival). Zero artifacts dull closure image of ripples and disappearing smile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess puzzle inheritance into acoustic serendipity engineering transforms street performer trope. Bishop's moonlight sync and laughter adaptation feel inevitable from setup. Risk in embracing "calculated wilderness" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
