<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in calcified guilt compels forging with embodied contradiction—decades' silence vs. blood-pricked certainty—earning forgiveness through micro-choice of ink-mingled blood, foreclosing fear with treason's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from setup to forging; key crumbling delivers CR with conceptual cost of unlinking legacy, reconfiguring history's chains on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora's shifting light constrains treaty inspection and charges closure; stalactites' drip as micro-setting mirrors endurance, evolving causally to final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "each stroke carried the weight," propulsion via varied syntax matches accumulative rise to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-metal key unlinks metaphorical chains in calibrated treason premise, synthesizing forgery with subtle magic-realism for fresh historical reconfiguration.</comment>
