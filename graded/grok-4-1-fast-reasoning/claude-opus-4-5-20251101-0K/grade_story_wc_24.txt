<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Einar's shift from dismissing journal as madness to counting backwards earned by embodied observations like water flowing upward; final step-through forecloses normal life with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via countdown density to CR closure at "exhaled zero and stepped through," reweighting time as lattice with conceptual cost in vanishing; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's brass instruments and fjord quiet constrain revelation, tracking impossible angles and deepening to blood pulse; charges final silent station image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to comprehend clocks tightens accumulatively through manifesting razor edges, forcing agency in countdown and step; cost legible in abandonment like Magnusson.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of clocks measuring possibilities emerges organically from journal, anomalies, and razor edges; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in clock drips and hums; voice modulates rhythm to match deepening quiet and razor precision under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels countdown; purposeful figures like "lattice" integrate without muddle, clear propulsion to spinning key.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hydraulic clocks as doorways transforms time trope via backward counting and razor edges; bold CR risks conceptual payoff that feels inevitable.</comment>
