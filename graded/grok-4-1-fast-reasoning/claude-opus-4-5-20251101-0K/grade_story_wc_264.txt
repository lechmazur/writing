<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to cultivate sparks drives the core choice to help the child, embodied in chest ache and clock warmth; contradictory dreamlessness vs. hope acts in scene without tidy resolution. Grandmother reflection anchors present tilting via equations whispered. Final endurance of non-dreaming with carried hope earns closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dune song and flower frequencies build density to child anomaly, tightening via charm action; Charged Poise closure in synchronized clocks reconfigures possibilities with dimming glow as cost. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity; persistent archive constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune's bioluminescent flowers constrain via emitted frequencies that ache with memory and stabilize child, charging final pollen footprints. Sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent sand, fractured lullaby) filters through Mira's probability bias. Recurrent clock as micro-setting warms and resonates, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guarding probability sparks) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to timeline spill; agency in charming wave functions forecloses paradox with flower-cost. Pressure coheres via archive bleed; child's backward clock complicates without resolving. Final image crystallizes stance with undeniable hope-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of latent possibilities emerges via splintered timelines, clocks at midnight, and sparks; final non-literal image of pollen footprints reweights "all possible moves" without moralizing. Subtext in child's question/answer layers complexity; archive motifs constrain choices organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (timelines in reflections, flowers as branches) stable single-POV; rhythm modulates from dune song to fading frequencies. Dialogue natural/subtextual advances plot ("You're from a branch that burned faster"); no head-hopping, diction biased to Mira's archive lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/probability images without loops; rhythm varies (short crest sentences to flowing descent). No scaffold, figurative coherence in wave/lullaby motifs; final line recharges midnight motif crisply. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-probability synthesis via chess clocks, archive bleeds, and probability seeds transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative lens heightens stakes via "occasionally everywhere." Final pollen path inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
