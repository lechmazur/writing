<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in perceptual gift and mother's loss compel the final renunciation; contradictory impulses peak in "She pressed her lips together and chose silence," earning stasis with embodied cost. No on-page relationships limits relational crucible, but solo execution flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered revelations building to CR closure; "The echo is not reflection... extraction" decisive deepening with conceptual cost in final silence. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus and stars constrain choices via hunger mechanic, charging final "groaned with something like hunger, something like loss"; sensory hierarchy (harmonies over wind) POV-specific. Phosphorescent moss in vision integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why echo?) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through shell/visions to knowledge shift narrowing options; agency in progressive singing yields reversal, cost felt in "never sing freely again." Coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of extraction vs. silence emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in final image reweighting song as vulnerability without moralizing. Webs and shell shift meaning, inviting ambiguity on canyon's loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "layered harmonies of intention"; rhythmic prose modulates to compression in revelation beats. No dialogue; diction biased to sonic frequencies suits echo singer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully, propelling from setup to "Some silences... worth singing." Figuratives like "stars pulsed in rhythms" purposeful, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living canyon harvesting echoes transforms trope into moral calculus of silence; risk in CR ending inevitable from prior particulars. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual world coherent.</comment>
