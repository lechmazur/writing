<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to voice the unknown drives consistent micro-choices like following warmth and offering the fossil, with embodied emotion via thermal sensors; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, but endurance to stay earns closure with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of revelations (fossil spike, lights) to Charged Poise CR at water's edge and final mapping; orientation anchored early ("coastal cave network"), closure reconfigures epochs with conceptual cost of patient unknowns in last image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cave's damp limestone, thermal gradients, and river constrain path and charge fossil/lights climax; sensory hierarchy via POV (heat to emotion/color) filters urgency, evolving with action to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping silent emotions tightens via fossil's "impossible data" and lights' response, deepening to interspecies bridge under Accumulative lens; protagonist agency in offering fossil forecloses isolation with legible conceptual cost in poised connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transitional objects bridging epochs emerges organically from fossil/child message and lights' mapping of Vera; final image reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity of unheard voices, inviting reflection on human haste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (thermal translations to color/emotion) and rhythmic modulation under discovery pressure; no dialogue, but lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged final poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in reflective metaphors ("heart still beating") slightly dulls peak density but doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heat-mapping emotions, ancient fossil-child message, and bioluminescent interspecies reply transforms sci-fi hibernation trope via specific geological/emotional logic; risk-taking in Accumulative CR heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
