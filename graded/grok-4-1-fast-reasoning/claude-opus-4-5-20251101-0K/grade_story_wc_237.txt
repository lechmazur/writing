<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fight vs. embrace ice) act simultaneously in the rune-drawing beat, earning the final transformation with vulnerability as felt cost; interiority particular via scar-triggered frost and crow-counting tics. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("ice was not a flaw") verges on diagnostic but embodies via prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual densities (steam scar cue → frost → rune on ice) tighten to RR closure in shedding scene ("frost crackled, then shed... scar remained—but changed"), with legible conceptual cost of accepting ice-language in iridescent map. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Platform's dry center and rain curtains constrain ritual stillness, charging final hush image; fractals, steam, tea char-honey integrate tactilely via POV priorities. Recurring crows mirror internal release without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform ice-curse) signaled in petition, deepens accumulatively via second frost embraced for rune, narrowing to trade-off (vulnerability on shuddering platform). Cost legible in trembling hands and shed sheets; agency in not fighting ice suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (scars as stories) emerges organically from rune-on-scar action, crow superstition, answered resonantly in final "write her scars into stories" realization reweighting curse without moral state. Crows' reprise shifts from sorrow-superstition to secret-kept poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias (scars as "map," frost "fractals"); rhythm modulates from tense pours to saturated hush, stable close-third POV with no leakage. Syntax reflects scholar's precision under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "frost began to crystallize, spreading in delicate fractals" advances sense/emotion/action); varied rhythm propels without overwriting, metaphors coherent (ink robes, bird-sheets).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of body-as-rune-page and folk-superstition ritual transforms magic-apprentice tropes; risk in "body itself became the page" feels inevitable via scar-tea traceability, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
