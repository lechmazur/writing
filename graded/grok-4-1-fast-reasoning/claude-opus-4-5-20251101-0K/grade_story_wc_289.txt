<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in twig-handling and letter-writing, revealing contradiction between mechanical past and present reconnection; final endurance (keeps twig) earned with embodied cost ("lighter hands"); no diagnostic speak flattens crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure ("leaving her confession to dissolve... lighter hands" makes impermanence cost legible); orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pond and spheres constrain release choice and charge final image (dissolving among others); post-rain prisms filter through Mira's priorities, vivid and selective without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect writing's thread) signaled early, deepens via installation insight forcing self-letter agency; release forecloses permanence with felt cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from twig-spheres parallel to CR ("every letter was a twig in some larger architecture"); resonant non-literal answer reweights vessel to practice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with lyrical perceptual signature ("washed light," "prismatic quiet"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (helix/spheres); varied syntax propels without loops or scaffolds; closure image crisp and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter's spiral motif with dissolving spheres transforms introspection trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically.</comment>
