<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through star-dust analogies; earned shift from practical sorting to acceptance shows contradictory science-emotion impulses. Final pocketing of slide reveals values hierarchy with cost of letting go. Minor therapy-speak echo ("strip needless drama") borders diagnostic but anchors motivation without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in final orchid image, reweighting resistance with humility's cost. Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse post-flood. Single scene fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Damaged greenhouse concretely constrains (kneeling amid debris, light through cracks); recurring dust/light charges final orchid bloom. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities (iridescent scales like stellar spectra). Micro-setting (surviving slide drawer) mirrors internal decay without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process grief practically) deepens accumulatively via slide/orchid observations, narrowing to endurance of gradual change. Agency in attention/acceptance forecloses drama with felt emotional cost. One tightening sufficient; lacks sharper trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gradual decay theme emerges organically from dust/scales/stars particulars, reweighted in orchid defiance. Subtext in mother's phrase integrates without sermon; final image answers "preprocessing" implicitly. Direct articulation ("universe preprocesses") slightly overt but anchored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: scientific lens filters dust as "spectral analyses." Rhythmic modulation builds to quiet cadence; purposeful compression in observations serves lyric texture. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/insight (e.g., "scales shimmered, iridescent... tiny architecture of chitin"). Varied rhythm propels without loops; metaphors coherent (stellar decay to butterfly dust). Zero scaffolds or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes neutron stars/butterfly scales/flood decay into fresh grief lens; quiet CR ending risks bold lyricism that heightens humility stakes. Transformation of tropes feels inevitable via Mira's particular expertise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
