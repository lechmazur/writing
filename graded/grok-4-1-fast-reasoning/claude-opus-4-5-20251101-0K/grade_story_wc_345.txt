<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to tend peace feels rooted and intensifies through invitation; ghost's penance drives altruism consistently. Interiority concrete via sighting and tracing chalk. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in Elara flattens peak choice versus ghost's gentle refusal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from message to collective action to final exchange. Closure as Charged Poise in ghost's reply ("I am not alone. I have you. That is enough.") reconfigures isolation with emotional cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and mist constrain grove work and ghost's distance; starfruit and fog filter through Elara's priorities. Bell as micro-setting charges final ring, mirroring belonging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tending peace amid thirst/forgetting) signaled early; accumulative deepening via invitation/response forecloses joining, with relational cost felt. Agency in Elara's message and colony actions tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stubborn hope emerges via chalk bridge between living/lost; final image of glowing words and bell reweights isolation-to-belonging without statement. Complexity in ghost's refused connection lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Elara POV with perceptual signature (knowing traces, nods); voice poetic yet controlled, modulating to poignant close. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven (Marcus grunt advances briefing).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels from dawn to evening; no loops or artifacts. Figuratives like "brambled hope" purposeful, integrated without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of benevolent ghost as penitent orchestrator on floating orchards transforms tropes organically. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes of connection without gimmick.</comment>
