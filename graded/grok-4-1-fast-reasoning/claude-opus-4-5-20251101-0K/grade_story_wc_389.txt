<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (blessing vs. doubt) act simultaneously in the transmission beat; final renunciation of prophethood is earned through prior teaching of Caro and signal collection, with cost in ending her isolation via arriving followers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via radio voices culminating in Charged Poise closure (campfires shift upward); cost legible in "loneliness... waiting for them to arrive ready to listen," reconfiguring her stance without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt portico and radio constrain observation/transmission choices and charge final image of campfires through glass; stormlit specifics (lightning shades, static crackle) evolve with pressure, mirroring internal doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent war via doubt) tightens via transmission reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in "I offer you doubt" forecloses blessing path with legible cost in redirected campfires.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of doubt over certainty emerges implicitly from signals of fallen civilizations; final image of climbing campfires offers resonant answer to prophethood question, reweighting ancient shadows without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (weather/regret metaphors) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual (Caro's plea vs. Miriam's broadcast) advances under stable single POV, modulating rhythm with storm intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., radio dial adjustment integrates action/atmosphere); no loops or artifacts, rhythmic variety peaks in closure "static sing," charging image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope via electromagnetic ghosts transforms post-apoc prophecy; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, with transmission turn inevitable from radio motif.</comment>
