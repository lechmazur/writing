<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory analytic impulses vs emotional surge acting simultaneously during snow globe retrieval; final transformation earned by prior losses priming the captain's lesson, foreclosing detachment with felt cost of faith over force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening discoveries (layout to quarters to artifacts); on-page Charged Poise closure in securing globe/pages reconfigures grief as current, with cost legible in "ready to break through" facing the surface world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submersible lights, gloved hand, coral shelves constrain choices and charge final ascent image; sensory details (breath sound, swaying anemones) filtered through analytic POV bias mirror drowned knowledge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through artifact chain narrowing emotional options; agency in noting/retrieving forces trade-off of detachment vs surrender, cost felt in trembled hand and restrained surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-current emerges implicitly from particulars (snow globe tempest, captain's meditation); final image of surface sun reweights losses without moral, offering resonant non-literal answer to letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in oceanic metaphors ("drowned words," "vast indifferent sea"); rhythmic control modulates from melancholic density to poised cadence in ascent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "snow drifted down around the tiny vessel, a storm captured in perpetuity"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propulsion aligns with reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library/philosophers with personal grief via snow globe's "Dimittere est navigare"; transforms Earhart trope into foil for forgotten history, risk in lyric reflection pays off at closure.</comment>
