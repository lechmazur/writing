<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under wistful pragmatism compel the moonlight reflection; grandfather's inheritance earns the wave's vulnerable endurance. Minor epiphanic phrasing in "She understood now" borders unearned but anchors to concrete beam on glass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density from petal drop to beam-waver to wave exchange; Charged Poise closure lands with legible cost in the retreating hand and bare rosebush. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fire escape's narrow constraints heighten vulnerability; recurring rosebush charges final image of pruning/new growth. Sensory hierarchy (moonlight on brass, harbor pulse) filters through gardener's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tending endings tightens via beam to stranger's window, forcing exposure trade-off; visible cost in trembling hand and retreating shadow under Accumulative lens. One deepening suffices, cohering to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent small lights emerges implicitly from tomato offerings to moonbeam wave; final rosebush image reweights pragmatism with non-literal resonance, no moralizing. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in plant/light observations; rhythmic modulation peaks in hush without head-hopping. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; minor overwrite in "hammered silver"/"tiny constellations" clusters but pattern serves moonlight motif without muddling closure. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bitting gauge transforms inheritance into light-tool for illegal squatter, fresh synthesis of garden pragmatism and harbor pulse; risk in quiet wave exchange heightens stakes organically.</comment>
