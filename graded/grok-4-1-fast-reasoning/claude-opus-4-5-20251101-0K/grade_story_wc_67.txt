<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—wanting to "crystallize this fleeting emotion" vs. accepting "emotions couldn't be kept"—act in scene through ritual choices, earning final endurance in rocking chair with visible cost of permanence lost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to Charged Poise closure as ashes settle and mask warms, reconfiguring presence/absence with conceptual cost legible in "vanishing point... pulse once, gently."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery's receding paintings and threshold constrain scatter choice; rocking chair and mask as micro-settings charge final image, with dust motes and porcelain fragments filtering through Marina's grief-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honest ritual inheritance tightens via mask donning that transforms vision, forcing trade-off in releasing ashes; cost felt in "emptiness that remained" foreclosing grasp on grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final rocking chair image offers resonant answer to partial-truth theme—"through incomplete information, healing could begin"—reweighting mirage of safety without moralizing, emerging from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in "dust motes... tiny universe suspended in grief"; rhythmic control heightens ritual pressure, diction biased toward artistic vanishing motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from creak fading to "rhythm filling the silence," metaphors coherent (paintings "breathe") without muddle in peak scatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-scattering gallery with porcelain mask and partial portraits transforms grief tropes; risk in infinite-recession premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ritual logic.</comment>
