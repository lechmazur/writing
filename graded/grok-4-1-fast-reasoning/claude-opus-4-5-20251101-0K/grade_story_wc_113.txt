<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clara's motivation as an obsessed pit musician drives specific micro-choices like decoding stains and prizing the panel; her shift to seeing invisibility as power lands earned via prior obsession, though backstory fragments slightly abstract internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising water revealing stains/program/documents to a Charged Poise closure (nod, ghost softens, truth sealed/carried out) with legible cost in her lifelong marginality reconfigured; orientation instant, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains choices (wading to position, case overhead, numb fingers on panel) and charges final image (water laps waist as truth surfaces); sensory details (lantern shadows on water, plaster faces) filter through musician's eye without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel Voss's truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via new stains/program to discovery; agency in photographing/decoding/prizing forecloses ignorance with felt immersion cost (cold rising water), though no sharp reversal narrows further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of marginal power/truth surfacing emerges implicitly from pit revelations and final "only water damage remained, beautiful and meaningless to anyone else"; resonant non-literal answer reweights invisibility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with musician's perceptual signature (notations as maps, face shifting); lyrical rhythm modulates pressure, no leakage; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("water lapped against her waist"), rhythm varies; minor overwriting in opening ("offering to whatever gods") and occasional purple ("ancient waltz") slightly dulls peak clarity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water damage as ghostly code in orchestra pit transforms ghost story trope via musician's marginal insight; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable vindication image.</comment>
