<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in narration distancing grief while whittling reveals suppressed shape of daughter-figure; final endurance of "remade hush" earned by accumulating micro-choices like touching brittle petals, with moral cost of state ambiguity legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as routine builds density to charged poise in final chopping image; closure as conceptual repricing reconfigures mandate's suppression into harnessed persistence, cost felt in "almost smiled" under turbine shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines' shadows and hum constrain whittling prayer and drown silence, charging final window reflection; dried bouquet evolves tactilely from windowsill anchor to cracked petals under fingers, mirroring internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of private grief cultivation tightens texturally via drone pass and 17th figure, forcing endurance trade-off; cost unmistakable in ongoing public blankness versus private figures lining rail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "quiet persistence of continuing" non-literally answers mandate's impossibility via turbine harnessing image, reweighting grief from darkness to essence without moralizing; emerges organically from whittling curls as unshed tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Performer-biased perceptual signature shines in theatrical narration modulating mundane tasks; rhythmic control heightens under drone pressure, stable close-third POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in narration beats, e.g., "curls of wood falling like the tears she couldn't shed"; zero loops, purposeful elevated diction fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mandate-dystopia with performative grief-carving transforms tropes via turbine metaphor; risk of quiet rebellion heightens stakes, inevitable in "remade hush" hindsight.</comment>
