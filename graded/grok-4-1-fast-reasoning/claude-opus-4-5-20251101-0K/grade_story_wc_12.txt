<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's micro-choices like pressing the loop pedal and drawing symbols reveal a hierarchy of values, with contradictory impulses in Elena's flickering eyes and responses earning the exorcism reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as looped questions layer density to resonant reconfiguration at "shadows dissolved," with 3-minute clock and anchor as persistent constraints shaping tactics and cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor hum and ash-gray symbols constrain climax choice by resonating to solidify boundaries, charging the final standing image with tactile cold stone and writhing shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadows writhe violently under question accumulation, tightening dominant stake via Marcus's agency until Elena's scream/laugh crystallizes stance with felt cost of entity's unraveled weave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final echo "What if doubt is sin?" offers resonant non-literal reweighting of certainty-as-prison premise, emerging organically from layered questions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in rhetorical "cathedral of logic" phrasing; dialogue carries subtext like "certainty is a closed door," advancing under muffled clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High-density propulsion via varied rhythmic layering of looped questions without redundancy or artifacts; climax prose tightens at palette press with zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Loop pedal questions as exorcism synthesizes priest/artist/dimensional horror originally, transforming possession trope through doubt-armor premise with risk-taking payoff at final hum.</comment>
