<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode linguistic growth intensifies credibly through embodied actions like trembling hand during realization; interiority particular via etymology preference and desperation. Contradictory impulses subtle (innocence vs. aged resolve) but act in vigil endurance with solitude cost. No stock phrasing; flaws like reticence drive isolation payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via word tests to pattern emergence (rhythm matching growth rings); CR closure in final "Begin" whisper reweights dormancy premise with conceptual cost of endless vigil legible in splintered light and notebooks. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal as micro-setting constrains choices (word-speaking tests) and charges final image (splintered colors, sun across notebooks). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (acoustic focus amid visual dawn); shadowed library tactile/lived-in, mirroring internal hush without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove language dormant) signaled early, deepens via rhythm pattern discovery narrowing to hopeful endurance; agency in persistent testing forecloses evacuation path with felt solitude cost. Accumulative escalation via cadence shift reweights under lens; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language's tree-like growth emerges organically from crystal tests and realization; final image ("Begin" echo) offers resonant CR repricing dormancy without moralizing. Subtext in fractured returns invites ambiguity on evolution's hope amid world's silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (etymological bias, sonic focus); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to revelation without drift. Voice texture distinct in syntax echoing splintering; no dialogue, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance observation + atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language pattern-taught via crystal echoes. Read-aloud ear clean; closure image vivid without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dictionary stasis + sonic crystal as language oracle transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric Accumulative build pays off in CR closure. Non-obvious growth rings linkage feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
