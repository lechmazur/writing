<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously at vial hover ("Instinct, perhaps... bone-deep knowledge"); final renunciation earned by prior memory touches and dead man's pose, with embodied cost in oxygen beep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush/memories builds to Charged Poise closure in vial filling and ascent; cost legible in "not proof but testimony" as she foregoes funding/science.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple's micro-setting (touchable walls, thick water) constrains vial access and charges final "empty crystal vial pressed against her heart"; sensory hierarchy narrows under oxygen urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof via ephemeral) tightens via vial's snarled memories forcing unsnarling agency; cost in foreclosed scientific path and personal memory deposit unmistakably felt on ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral survival via witness emerges organically from particulars; final image non-literally answers by reweighting capture as exploitation, with counter-reading in temple's patient silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (hush as weight, memories rippling); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, urgent unsnarling sentences under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor simile density ("frozen starlight," "rainbows through dark water") in opening risks overwriting without closure harm; no loops, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-distillation premise with underwater sanctuary transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens lonesome stakes, inevitable in hindsight via vial reprise.</comment>
