<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in father's inheritance compel her endurance, with the vial's warmth revealing character under pressure. Micro-choices like precise equipment setup show hierarchy of values. Minor flaw: subtle epiphanic summary ("She understood that now") borders therapy-speak without full embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise CR in final image: stars fading to satellites as she touches vial, reweighting progress's cost. Orientation anchors early (climbing summit, crater). One tightening via rupturing packets narrows to 17 seconds; cost legible in "never exist again."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlit summit and crater lake constrain choices (scree climb, still setup) and charge closure image (ripples, held breath). Sensory hierarchy via POV: orbital lights as "fallen constellations" filter her loss. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture last darkness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via timers ("seventeen more seconds"), forcing endurance with cost in fading stars/orbitals. Agency in patient witnessing forecloses pure night. No reversal needed; deepening reweights via live clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed loss emerges from particulars (crater's transformation, vial), culminating in resonant CR: "It was enough" reconfigures progress without moralizing. Subtext in vial/father callbacks charges ending organically. Ambiguity lingers in acceptance's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (darkness as "deepest saturation"); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse countdown ("seventeen more seconds"). Lyrical diction controlled, prose as character reflects her patience. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful ("moon like a held breath") propel without muddle. Minor scaffold in adjacent reflections on father/outlasting, but integrated. Propulsion clear to closure image; no loops or artifacts dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chemical photography for "dawning hush" transforms light pollution trope via personal inheritance. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final orbital intrusion inevitable from setup. Non-obvious angle on space age loss feels organic.</comment>
