<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Senna's confession—"I was cruel to my mother"—embodies contradictory shame and release under light pressure, earning her final commitment to stay; dye master's indigo hands and precise pouring reveal watchful particularity that forces her micro-hesitation with the wing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations build to light reaching Senna's hands, triggering involuntary confession (DC) and Charged Poise closure in "Yes... I'll stay," reconfiguring her borrowed life with opportunity cost of prior silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sun trails constrain pivotal confession as light "crawl[s] across the tea house floor" to her feet; floating rocks and mist charge final image as "ancient witnesses," mirroring internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inheriting story-magnetizing gift) deepens texturally via light's approach forcing confession, narrowing to renunciation of old cruelty; cost legibly felt in heart's acceleration and "first true thing" decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wing evolves from "iridescent caution" to "map of iridescent caution," offering non-literal answer to inheritance question by reweighting light as truth-key; resonance emerges from confession without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Senna-limited POV with perceptual bias (heart vibrations, light pulses); dialogue subtextual—"You carry something of hers"—pursues revelation goals; rhythmic diction modulates from wonder to charged intensity at "heart... respond with recognition."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "light reached Senna's hands... she spoke," varying rhythm without artifacts; purposeful figures like "blue fire" enhance without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant trope with light-trail magic realism and story-magnetism transforms into inevitable wing-map inheritance; risk of subtle causality via light/butterflies heightens stakes organically.</comment>
