<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's expertise as arcane linguist drives concrete micro-choices like feeling book pulses and speaking plant-language, earning her pivotal shift; time traveler applies targeted pressure without diluting her agency. Internal understanding "blooms" ties embodied emotion to motive without stock epiphanies. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak speech moment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds revelation density to Charged Poise closure: Mira's speech reconfigures mountain's role with conceptual cost in release and hope. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2 (mountain hollowed, Mira's purpose). Time traveler's warning tightens stakes without causal break, holding lens cleanly to "sunlight waited like a question."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain's "granite heart replaced with shelves like nautilus" vividly constrains search and charges final emergence between new shelves. Sensory details (ozone/regret smell, fluttering pages) filter through Mira's linguistic bias, mirroring internal states via pulses and unheard symphonies. No white-room; spatial coherence holds through endless corridors to mouth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue via finding shifting library) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via diary map and mountain revelation, forcing speech agency that forecloses hoarding path. Cost felt in mountain's shudder/silence and hopeful reconfiguration. Time traveler complicates without resolving; minor abstractness in "lessons into the world" tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ignored wisdom emerges organically from diary gaps, mountain's shame, and final carrying-out; "sunlight waited like a question humanity might finally answer" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and blooms avoids binaries, embracing guardian's complex wound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (languages in gaps, growing things); dialogue subtext-laden ("Everything wants to be found eventually") pursues goals distinctly. Rhythmic texture modulates to compression in speech climax. Minor elevated diction in peaks fits linguistic voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "petals pressed flat from gardens that would never exist" advance world/character. Varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with revelation buildup; figurative consistency (blooms, symphonies) purposeful, no muddle or loops in peaks. Minor density in opening metaphors doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms library/time-travel tropes into living-mountain guardian hoarding unlearned lessons, with fresh synthesis peaking in plant-language negotiation. Risky conceptual pivot feels inevitable from diary gaps. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
