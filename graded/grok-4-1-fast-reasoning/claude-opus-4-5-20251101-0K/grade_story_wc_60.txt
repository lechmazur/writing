<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Skepticism shown in "Her skepticism warred with hope" at fountain, compelling sacrifice of mother's laughter; contradictory impulses act in scene with earned final choice and visible cost. Internal conflict embodied without labels; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: geese pause → breadcrumb trail → fountain center key → turn releases memories (DC) with legible cost in "Her mother's laughter was gone now." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single arc fits scope, no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fountains and amber crystals constrain choices, mirroring internal states (e.g., "thousands of trapped memories pushing back"); geese as recurring object charge final image of resumption. Sensory selection urgent and POV-biased; spatial choreography clear through streets to basin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early, tightens via breadcrumb discovery narrowing to sacrifice at "channel through the amber"; agency in guiding laughter forecloses hoarding path with on-page cost. Causal escalation coherent; moral calculus sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared vs. hoarded memories emerges from particulars, resonant in final image "Individual memories weren't meant to be hoarded... flowing freely"; reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in sacrifice layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (skeptical filter on "realistic mechanism"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax ("sound... like a long-held sigh"). Diction purposeful, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "laughter spilled out, warm and golden, dissolving the crystals"); zero loops, varied rhythm, metaphors coherent (frozen geese → birds free). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-water premise with crystal blockage and laughter solvent feels inevitable; risk in solo quest heightens stakes. Transforms stasis trope via causal key-turn.</comment>
