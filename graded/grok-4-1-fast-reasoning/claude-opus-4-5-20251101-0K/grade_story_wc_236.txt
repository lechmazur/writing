<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Elena's touch-based perception versus lost smell act concretely during clamp exam; final restorative choice earned via prior loss-motivated patience, with relational cost in Margaret's grief release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via emotional density buildup to Charged Poise closure in screw-freeing and clamp handoff; cost legible in "trembling hands, tears finally falling," reconfiguring inheritance with felt generational price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water clocks and fog constrain repair choices (delicate tools for millimeter precision) and charge final image (dripping seconds mirroring life-by-life healing); sensory touch hierarchy reflects Elena's bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of humanizing generational grief tightens via screw-reveal deepening under textural lens, forcing Elena's agency in gentle freeing; cost unmistakable in Margaret's cracked voice and tears, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges implicitly from restoration particulars, reweighting loss-to-patience arc; final water clocks/life image offers non-literal resonance without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct touch/perception signature ("feeling for imperfections she could no longer smell") biases noticing; dialogue subtextual (Margaret's unsaid failure via whispers) advances with natural idiom distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "screw isn't just rusted... bonded the oxidation" advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-loss to tactile restoration transforms repair trope organically; risk in poetic fog/occlusion layering heightens emotional stakes without gimmick, inevitable at clamp's bright metal reveal.</comment>
