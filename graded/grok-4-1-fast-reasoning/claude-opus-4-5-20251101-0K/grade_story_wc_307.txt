<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elowen's backward aging embodied in supple joints and raw youth-grief compels withholding; Vara's patience reveals through micro-choice of trance entry. Contradictory impulses peak in Elowen's chest-tightening grief during revelation. Final bow earned by causality, foreclosing Elowen's presence with felt teacher-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rings expand to interference CR, reweighting vanishing as collision with undeniable conceptual cost in "throw the second stone." Orientation anchored by first line (floating rock, forest). Single scene, no shards; pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rock and pool constrain trance/revelation; sycamore hush and starlit rings charge final image of absence made visible. Sensory hush mirrors internal expansion, filtered via Elowen's pattern-reading. Grotto lines anchor platform sway, guiding Vara's wave-throwing tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore village via vanishing craft) signaled early, tightens via stone-drop deepening (collision insight narrows options). Agency in Elowen's delayed reveal forces Vara's earned stance; cost legible in Elowen's "strange grief of youth" and impending vanish. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rings motif shifts from encoded grammar to amplifying wave, resonant non-literal answer to absence-as-presence without moral. Theme emerges organically from withheld stone-drop and Elowen's life-demo; final image reweights premise via "woven himself into the lesson."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (leaf patterns only Elowen reads) biases details; voice hush-textured, modulates in trance-whisper. Dialogue subtextual ("delayed revelation creates deepest knowing"), advances goal. No head-hopping; elision of grotto mechanics paid in rings payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short trance lines vs. expansive rings desc.); density high, each line advances texture/pressure sans loops. Figurative coherent (rivers backward, interference blooms), no muddle in peak reveal. Propulsion peaks in "colliding with the second ring still traveling outward."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Backwards-aging into unborn synthesizes reversal with revelation craft organically; risk of floating rock/grotto physics heightens stakes via anchor-lines. Non-obvious collision premise transforms vanishing trope; Elowen's self-woven fade inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
