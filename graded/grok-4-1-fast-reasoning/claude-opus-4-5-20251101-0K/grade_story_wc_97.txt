<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory grief and strategic creativity drive the beacon choice, embodied in "tremor in her chest" yielding to "fingers steady"; earned renunciation of passive waiting forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds from film splice to piano signal, delivering Charged Poise closure in craft landing and clock reveal; cost legible in "three years through unmapped skies."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's currents and dusk gap constrain beacon timing, charging final landing; piano keys as tactile micro-setting enable pivotal action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusk horizon tightens stake via Elara's agency in decoding and amplified playing; one deepening via clock activation narrows passive wait, with years' separation as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Film-compass-piano motif reweights waiting as navigation, resonant in "unplanned encore" without moralizing; final image answers persistence vs. fate non-literally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion via varied rhythm integrates metaphors like "frequencies that could serve as lighthouse"; zero loops, clarity peaks in clock shudder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Piano-as-beacon in cloud arbor transforms reunion trope via frequency navigation; risk in sky-map premise heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
