<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in endurance of routine intensifies through ritual choices, embodied in trembling hands and shadowed elation; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from ascent to lighting/call; CR closure in rain falling exactly as called reconfigures forgotten compact with legible cost in aching legs and melancholy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse and lens constrain alignment/ritual and charge final dawn image on walls; sensory selection reflects herald's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maintaining sky compact signaled early, escalates via ritual density to prophetic call under accumulative lens; cost in physical toll and isolation felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of old ways vs. modern forgetting emerges organically; final raindrops resonate as non-literal answer to compact without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in storm/sky noticing and rhythmic poetic texture modulate with ritual intensity; stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; minor fig-lang density in lighting beat and "as always" loops slightly dull peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic herald, light physics, and prophecy transforms lighthouse trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes.</comment>
