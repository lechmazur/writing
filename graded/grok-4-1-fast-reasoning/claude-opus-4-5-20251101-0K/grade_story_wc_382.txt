<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to learn building language shown concretely via palm-pressing and hearing stretches, earning final teacher role with cost of Voss's fading; Voss distinct via patient traits and lies pact. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses in peak fade scene. Traits avoid stereotypes, voice coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: monthly deepenings build pattern to CR closure where narrator echoes opening ("You're here about the sugar"), reweighting cycle with conceptual cost of perpetual teaching duty. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (fire escape, rooftop). No lens ambiguity; single shard with time elision taught early pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden as micro-setting constrains lessons and charges final image (roses bloom despite frost); sensory details (starlight hair, groaning pipes) POV-filtered via architect's ear. Settlement cracks and desk seal evolve causally. Body (palm on walls) mirrors internal growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn before loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via translucency to force stance crystallization as teacher; cost legible in "borrowed time" and final responsibility. Agency in gentle interrogation narrows options. No coincidence resolution; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of languages surviving via chosen heirs emerges from sugar cycle, seal, garden without statement; final reprise ("Everyone starts with sugar") offers non-literal answer reweighting secrets' fragility. Subtext in unspoken lies adds ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in building's whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (buildings sing, apologize to banister) biased and consistent; dialogue subtextual ("You heard the elevator singing") pursues goals naturally. Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Voice distinct, elision of death taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short meteor lines propel fade); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. "Simply" repetition purposeful for lies motif. Propulsion peaks in "She faded with the last meteor's arc," recharging motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dead tutor teaches sentient architecture via sugar ploy, cycling heirlooms; transforms ghost/mentor tropes through building agency and lies pact. Risky quiet CR inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
