<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through copper veins pulsing with words and texture translations, rooting motivation in heritage; final language integration in blood earns change with embodied cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in trembling hands versus precise voice. No safety-hedging; flaws like withering tongue drive stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vein purpose realization to bird patterns revealing phonemes, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as diamond shatters and echoes join ancestors' voices—cost legible in crystal's destruction and ongoing work. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via birds suffices; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain resonance needs and charge final spiral of her voice; birds wheel through fractured diamond, mirroring internal textures. Sensory hierarchy (visual patterns, humming veins) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (diamond, throat) alters tactics at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive language) signaled early, escalates texturally via diamond interception and bird formations narrowing to resurrection; agency in pressing diamond forecloses curse path with shattering cost. Persistent constraint (dying tongue) shapes tactics; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of texture-to-sound resurrection emerges organically from particulars (bark, linen grit via veins/birds); final image reweights death (centuries) against afternoon revival without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "true work ahead." No tidy binaries; complexity in curse's dispersal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (textures as sound); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet articulation to humming intensity. Diction controlled, syntax reflects textural mind—e.g., "texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative peaks at climax); metaphors coherent and purposeful (veins as channels, diamond roots). Zero loops, scaffold, or overwriting; propulsion peaks in "copper beneath her skin sang," advancing closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of copper veins, bird algorithms, flawed diamond transforms language-death trope; birds' deliberate patterns and texture phonemes feel inevitable in hindsight. Bold textural conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry; authentic vision commits to premise.</comment>
