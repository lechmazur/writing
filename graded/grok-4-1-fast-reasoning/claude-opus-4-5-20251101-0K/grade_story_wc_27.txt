<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (toes on grating, hum in chest); motivation to find meaning intensifies via stone visions, earning change. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers, but micro-choices under hum reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to CR closure ("every revolution was a stone circle") with legible endurance cost in "refusal to let the mess become the end." Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid/selective (rusted cranes, punctured ceiling as silver rain); barefoot body constrains/charges final image ("cold metal... like connection"). Environment subtly guides to stone circle, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in lull) signaled early, textural escalation via hum crescendo narrows to realization; agency in settling/listening forecloses doubt with felt endurance cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (lull as breath, stones reignite ashes); final image ("walked toward the light") resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with distinct perceptual signature (stargazer bias in opera glasses, hum frequencies); rhythmic prose modulates serenely to crescendo, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; metaphors purposeful/coherent (thunderous serenity). Minor figurative density in peak hum beat but no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space rebellion, ancient hum, barefoot endurance transforms tropes; stone circle realization inevitable from particulars, lyric risk heightens resonance.</comment>
