<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's contradictory impulses—facts as armor vs. sentiment over cloth—earn the closure insight; Val's pressure forces micro-choice in grip. Minor slip in overt epiphany phrasing ("purpose doesn't disappear") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pivotal dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloth discovery to Val's dialogue, landing CR closure in "purpose waited. Not found, exactly. Carved free" with cost of failure legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry as inverse amphitheater charges final image, constraining isolation in trailer; sensory details (dust, condensation, shadows pooling) selective via music bias. No white-room; vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via cloth-Val exchange narrowing sentimental denial; agency in insight forecloses escape path with public failure cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from cloth/quarry parallels to "after applause" question; final image reweights premise non-literally as "echo... carved free," resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (music facts filter all); Val's blunt idiom distinct from Marcus's precise diction. Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (e.g., "shadows pooled like old regrets" purposeful, not muddled). Propulsion peaks in dialogue-insight cadence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music relic in stone pit transforms post-fame loss trope; cloth-quarry echo inevitable in hindsight, risking quiet CR over confrontation.</comment>
