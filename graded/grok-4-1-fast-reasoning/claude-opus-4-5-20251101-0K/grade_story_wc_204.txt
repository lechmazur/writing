<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's cryptic motivation against perfect systems compels her micro-choices like backward type-setting and lever-pull, earning the closure with embodied contradiction between maintenance and disruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as frost patterns densify to whisper release, delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when "The library shuddered, then laughed" with cost of dissolved press and descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass branches and frost fractals constrain her reading and key the climax; final cracks charge the image, mirroring internal shift with tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of rupturing equilibrium tightens accumulatively through pattern-tracing to lever-pull agency; cost unmistakable in press dissolution and library's imperfect awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perfection as prison emerges organically from frost warnings and whisper's spread; ending's "beautiful imperfections" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (fractal-reading, type-humming) sustains poetic diction and rhythmic modulation to charged closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors like "mist but moved like longing"; no loops, closure image shines with "lightning frozen in amber."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard with stellar-whisper rupture synthesizes fresh fantasy logic; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via frost buildup.</comment>
