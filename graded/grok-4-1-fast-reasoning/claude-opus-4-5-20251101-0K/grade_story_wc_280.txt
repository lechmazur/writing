<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Madeline's synesthetic interiority and contradictory encore-seeking versus redemptive purpose drive micro-choices like pulling echoes; earned stasis in "this, she decided, was close enough" forecloses full return with eternal wait as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density tightens to Charged Poise closure; woman's grip loosening and green/silver steps mark legible before/after with Madeline's lingering as felt cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/maze anchors sacred thinness post-closing, constraining manifestation; oldest apple tree recurs to charge final wait, mirroring internal states through leaves and twilight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Despair stake signaled early escalates via echo density under Accumulative lens, narrowing to woman's postural shift; Madeline's agency weaves timelines with visible cost of solitariness in closing lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crossroads/encore theme emerges from particulars like tarot coin and timeline overlaps, reweighting tragedy-to-possibility in final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (crimson swells, copper/pine tastes) biases noticing distinctively; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation heightens nostalgic crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via synesthetic texture; minor color motif density purposeful without muddle, though "echo" paraphrase in mid-beats nicks propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia-plus-echoes transforms ghost trope into textured performance of hope; risk of timeline mosaic heightens stakes organically to inevitable "close enough" reconfiguration.</comment>
