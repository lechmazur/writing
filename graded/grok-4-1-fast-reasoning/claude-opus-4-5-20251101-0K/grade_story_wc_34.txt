<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion via the bolt plate's weight and warmth anchoring her isolation to the ghost's; contradictory impulses emerge in her rare voice now compelled to sing what she seldom shares. Final endurance to paint her own messages feels earned by prior fragment-gathering causality, foreclosing silence with visible commitment cost. Single-POV strengths dominate; no relationships on page to test further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from fragment density (murals, coordinates) to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration: ghost disperses into song with luminous final image reweighting isolation into permanence, cost felt in dissolution and internalized mural. Orientation anchored early (Mira cross-legged in floating courtyard). Single scene with reflective shards under BRR; no shards exceed scope. Lens taught implicitly, closure legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and bolt plate as micro-setting constrain pivotal choices: mist pixels deliver "HELP ME REMEMBER," lightning frames "driftingly alert" awareness for clearest ghost speech. Sensory hierarchy (cold brass, swirling mist, resonant thunder) reflects Mira's perceptual bias toward encoding fragments. Atmosphere tensions ethereal isolation, evolving causally to harmonize thunder with song; recurring lightning charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate ghost's needs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening revelations ("You want me to sing what you couldn't say") forcing song-agency that forecloses ghost's fragmentation with bittersweet dispersal cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise ending; one decisive intensification suffices. No coincidence resolution; protagonist endurance crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encoding unspoken needs emerges organically from graffiti fragments, song-weaving, and mutual isolation, reweighted non-literally in intertwined mural image without moralizing. Subtext layers in petal-preserved melodies mirroring graffiti permanence; ghost's "LONELY. AFRAID." petals invite ambiguity on shared longing. Final reconfiguration answers isolation via permanence, charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (pixels-as-condensation, tinkersong wonder in voice); diction/rhythm modulate lyrically from misty drift to luminous crescendo without slippage. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("I understand now"); no head-hopping, elision purposeful in fragment backstory paid off at song-merge. Prose texture reflects Mira's balladeer mind under alert pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels accumulatively: sentences multi-task image/advance/emotion (e.g., "lightning cracked... suspended moment" setups thunder harmony). Varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts; figurative language patterned (mist/code pixels) without muddle in peak song-beat. Concision weaves reflection into action; zero scaffold in closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-code ghost and sky-monastery balladeer transforms isolation tropes via encoding permanence, with risk-taking lyric accumulation heightening stakes to luminous merger. Non-obvious angle on digital afterlife through analog song feels inevitable in hindsight; voice/setting cohere as bold artistic stance without gimmickry.</comment>
