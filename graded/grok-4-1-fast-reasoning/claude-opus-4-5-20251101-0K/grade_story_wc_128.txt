<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy intensifies through concrete micro-choices like tracing the photo and opening archives, earning her final commitment with felt communal cost. Interiority particular and embodied ("strange electricity of inherited obligation"). Minor slip: Elias's backstory dump slightly abstracts his pressure on Marina.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: envelope error accumulates to archives opened and ceremony via deepening discoveries. Orientation anchored early (rooftop library, harbor). Closure as CR in final library image reweights inherited debt with eternal cost ("compiling her next list"). One meaningful tightening at search initiation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breezy library under stars constrains choices (Thursday meetings) and charges final image ("stars wheeled... Marina Voss began compiling"). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (lighthouse beam pulsing with stars). Setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (righting forgotten labors) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven deepening (influence + archives). Cost legible in time/effort and "uncertain good." Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; ceremony crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from particulars (Rosa's ledger pages, plaque unveiling), final image offers non-literal resonance ("cycle doesn't work if we wait"). Subtext in silences/images avoids moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (broker's eye for discrepancies). Prose rhythm modulates (lyrical openings, terse dialogue). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("She would have said you didn't owe her anything"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts (e.g., no paraphrase in reflections). Figurative language purposeful/selective ("scattered sheet music," "barnacle-scraped steel"). Minor overwriting in opening sensory cluster, but propels without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Misdelivered envelope transforms mail trope into communal justice arc via broker's specifics. Fresh synthesis: historical ledgers + symphony frame heightens stakes organically. No derivative hedging; commits to premise.</comment>
