<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots consistently in traits like patience and discarding noise-as-assumptions, compelling her splicing choices; interiority particular via star fragment warming as embodied revelation under reception pressure. Earned peace forecloses doubt with emotional cost in weeping. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak tuning keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from static screams to hush reception as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting endings as doors with cost legible in "Mira wept" and "strange peace." Orientation anchors early via ladder/gorge/Voxhaven; single scene holds without shard excess. Persistent constraint of frozen console shapes tactics to closure image of listening towers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (texture over sound, electric air, mist depths) filters via interpreter bias, constraining splicing at frozen console and charging final towers-in-light image. Selective details like rusted rungs guide ascent choices without stall. No generic placeholders; micro-objects like pack components enable under perigee pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (parse signal for beginnings) signaled early, tightens via tuning failure/deepening to hush with agency in assumption-discarding; under Accumulative lens, density reweights options with wept cost felt on-page. One decisive intensification suffices; minor abstractness in initial static prevents 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-beginnings emerges organically from hush carrying "chemical promise" and dying stars' seeds, answered non-literally in "every door opened both ways" realization without moralizing. Final descent image recharges star fragment and towers. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (frequencies as texture, noise as signal) and rhythmic modulation (short charged sentences at reception). Prose texture distinct in syntax like "a shard of hush descended... weight and presence." No head-hopping or elision issues; compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "removed the filters... reversed the amplification" advances without loops); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no artifacts or muddled metaphors in peak hush beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Zero paraphrase/synonym churn obscures nothing at closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human towers listening cosmically transforms broadcast tropes via interpreter's practicality; risk in "fantasy practicality" and hush texture heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hush-to-peace arc from grounded splicing feels non-obvious. No derivative templates; bold perceptual frame memorable.</comment>
