<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions, like chest tightening at "boats are coming" revealing Marina's war-haunted flaws; final loosening earns change via micro-choices under pressure. Girl's shrewd innocence forces relational crucible without stereotypes. Voice particular to translator's lens on language/wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via decryption revelations; closure as Charged Poise in final image reconfigures healing/translation with felt cost ("some knot...loosened"). Orientation anchored early in atrium/procedure; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and twilight constrain intimacy (curling grates cocoon them), charging final image; body/anesthetic narrows perception purposefully. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (languages bleed like cast sweat). Coral reprise elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating wounds/memories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Tausug warning paralleling Marina's shrapnel; agency in softening message forecloses raw truth at cost to her bridge ideal. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language as bridge/blade emerges organically from decryption and coral; final "healing was just another form of translation" reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in girl's trust vs. Marina's past charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (noticing shrewd eyes, smudged scripts) biases toward linguistic bias; dialogue subtextual ("You understand it") advances goal. Rhythm modulates with anesthetic drift; distinct child idiom vs. adult.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated (mist "lotus-hearted ache" purposeful, not muddled); varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor overwrite in opening sensory but pattern-taught; "tanched" typo-like slips contained away from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator encountering refugee-like child in mundane hospital; Tausug warning transforms hospital encounter into Pacific echo. Coral's bleached structure risks bold metaphor, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
