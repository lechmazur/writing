<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with unembodied epiphanies like "unraveling was not destruction but translation," lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure; mythic consistency provides strength but no genuine struggle or visible cost forecloses a flawed path at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to CR closure—"she began to write the first word" reconfigures illusions as lenses with conceptual cost in blank pages and unified silence; orientation anchored early, one tightening at scrolls suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via "wanderingly exact" spiral path and charges final image with dictionary's blanking; selective sensory details like "pages soft as moth wings" mirror internal synthesis purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel illusions tightens accumulatively at circular chamber via reading aloud, forcing synthesis agency with felt conceptual cost in scroll transparency; abstract scale viscerally underdelivers but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of illusions as lenses emerges organically from scroll unification and dictionary's fulfillment, final image non-literally answers separation/sequence/ending without moralizing; resonant reweighting of prior spirals avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature mythic and biased toward cosmic abstraction, rhythmic syntax modulates to charged poise at "distinction meaningless now"; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwriting via stacked metaphors like "time pooled like water in a forgotten well" risks muddle in opening without harming closure; purposeful spiral repetition pattern-taught avoids loops, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of dictionary as language artifact transforming cosmic tropes via spiral logic feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in CR without gimmickry or derivative echoes.</comment>
