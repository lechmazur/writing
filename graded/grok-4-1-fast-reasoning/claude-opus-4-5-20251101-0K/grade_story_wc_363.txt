<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation as family weaver compels the sacrificial climax, rooted in concrete traits like calloused fingers and inherited hum; interiority embodied without epiphanies; final unraveling earned by bloodline trade with visible cost in thinning substance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/images builds to RR closure via bead pulse and thread vanishing; orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "pattern remained pressed into the moss."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bamboo creaks and light diamonds constrain timing/perception, evolving causally as orchard "remembering itself"; recurring moss charges final image; sensory selection (hush, glow) mirrors internal weave without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver message via sacrifice) signaled early, deepens through humming/vision to agency-driven unraveling under Accumulative lens; one tightening forecloses ordinary life with cost in "felt herself begin to unravel."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-sacrifice emerges organically from loom threads and silence reversal; final "three generations... work complete" reweights particulars without moralizing; resonant CR in golden thread vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (raveling metaphors) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates to charged poise at peak; one visionary line across time natural/subtextual, advances closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; figurative weave purposeful without muddle in peak ("unravel at the edges"); no loops, clear propulsion in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving/time-crossing transforms ghost trope via puzzle/bead mechanics; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from grandmother's rasp to Mei's delivery.</comment>
