<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in dismissing anomalies as "measurement errors" yields to embodied shift ("impossibility shifted beneath her like loose earth"); micro-choice to sit still before acting reveals integrity hierarchy with dawning risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as message density triggers pattern recognition tightening; Charged Poise closure in "she sat within it, already calculating her next lateral step" reconfigures quarantine premise with conceptual purpose-cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard's cupped-hands peace constrains reflective stillness, charging final image; selective dusk details ("lavender light," mossy fountain) mirror internal reconfiguration without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deepening from followed-home evasion to "she was dangerous... sought truth" via message-agency reweights solitary observation stake; cost legible in targeted pursuit forcing tomorrow's tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrity-through-small-choices emerges implicitly via records vs deception; final clouds image offers non-literal repricing of truth's burden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward storm patterns and lateral links; rhythmic compression in ending ("The stars brightened, and she began to walk home") sustains poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density with propulsion ("its burden had found new wings"); metaphors cohere storm-logic without muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather-manufacture premise synthesizes quarantine trope freshly via lateral logs; tranquil tone risks amid revelation, heightening "patient patience of storms" closure.</comment>
