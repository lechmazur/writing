<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Withdrawn knight's doubt as "second skin" creates embodied contradiction, compelling the pivotal unsnapping of armor as a micro-choice with visible cost, earning the final transformation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of pattern recognition to Charged Poise closure; program's patterns to golden threads deliver on-page Resonant Reconfiguration with surrender cost legible in "empty hands, a surrendered heart."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse's pressing night and alchemical trees constrain choices (web weaves through branches) and charge final image, with sensory selection (loamy soil, dripping pomegranates) mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to capture possibility escalates via reality shifts under Accumulative lens, tightening when allegiance weaves web and forces surrender trade-off; cost unmistakable in armor's thud and foreclosed warrior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of releasing certainty emerges organically from program's words to final marionette-puppeteer reconfiguration, offering resonant non-literal answer in laughing amid "shifting reality at once" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (pattern recognition from grandmother/temple) and rhythmic modulation ("reality shifted... gently at first"); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "shivering bliss of recognition... threaded with terror" doing triple duty (propel, embody, atmosphere); varied rhythm and zero loops/artifacts ensure propulsion through peak shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms knight trope via alchemical marionette logic into "vessel rather than warrior," with risk-taking in reality-bleeding closure heightening stakes organically from established patterns.</comment>
