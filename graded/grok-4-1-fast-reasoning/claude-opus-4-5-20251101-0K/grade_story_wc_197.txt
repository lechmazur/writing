<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Underestimated rebel trait drives micro-choices like decoy trigger and reappearance, earning endurance with felt cost of unraveled plans; interiority concrete via embodied patience under raid pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in vault scene prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: message triggers navigation→vault→upload→escape→reappear, with Charged Poise closure as truth surfaces post-raid, cost legible in "they would try" revision threat and key touch. One tightening via imminent raid narrows options; orientation anchored immediately at lagoon edge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and puddle reflections constrain navigation choice via light geometry and charge final image repricing engineered beauty; vault shelf details mirror internal stakes through tactile handling. Sensory hierarchy (whispering reeds, groaning lock) biases via archivist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth) signaled early, tightens causally via raid message forcing upload under boots; agency in decoy/escape forecloses capture path with plans' cost. Reappearance crystallizes stance with world-scale ripple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of contested history emerges via vault documents and surfacing truths, resonant in final lagoon/key image reweighting control vs. connection without moralizing. Particulars like grandmother's margins avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (light patterns, shadow distortions as archivist tools); rhythmic diction modulates from calm dusk to raid urgency. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in navigation beats; no loops, but minor paraphrase in "names" repetition purposeful. Clean mechanics, rhythm supports causal drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-map science and phone key relic transforms dystopian tropes via precise, lived resistance; risk in quiet reappearance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
