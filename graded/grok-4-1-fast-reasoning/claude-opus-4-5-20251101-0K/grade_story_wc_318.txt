<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied grief—tears salting sound while singing broken lullabies despite cracks—forcing raw micro-choices that earn the final hum to Margaret. Flaws like regret over mocking Margaret's tune complicate without tidy resolution. 9+ test met: impulses act simultaneously in the singing beat, culminating in earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: songs layer into resonance, tightening from fractured echoes to vibrating handle and fuller silence. Orientation anchored by para 2 (tunnel mouth, estate). Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "carrying laughter's possibility," cost felt in residual thrum and loosened clench.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's curved walls multiply footsteps and bend songs into "frequencies he felt," constraining the maceration ritual and charging final vibration. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant reflects Victor's acoustic trade. 9+ test: setting (tunnel acoustics) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve calcified silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fluttering photos to handle's sympathetic resonance, narrowing to stance crystallization. Cost legible in "every crack in his voice, every sharp edge of his grief." Agency in persistent singing despite breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonance unmaking silence emerges organically from half-sung household sounds shifting to "space for something new." Final image—wind carrying lullabies, "something that had been clenched began to loosen"—reweights prior motifs non-literally. 9+ test: resonant answer reconfigures without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature acoustic-biased ("roar and whine... almost musical"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing in peak singing. 9+ test: distinct signature holds under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: varied syntax breathes with emotional cadence, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors cohere (tunnel as "throat," sound "pressing against" photos). 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious premise transforms grief therapy via leaf-blower acoustics and "maceration" in echo tunnel, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric synthesis heightens resonance without gimmickry. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability with stakes-elevating risk.</comment>
