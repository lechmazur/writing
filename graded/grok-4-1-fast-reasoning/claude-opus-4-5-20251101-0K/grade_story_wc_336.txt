<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to preserve wonder roots deeply in lifelong tending and grandmother's legacy, embodied in daily essence-gathering ritual; internal endurance of age and limits earns final sharpening of blade. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract some micro-choices, but closure choice feels compelled without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fading colors through 40-day gathering to sapling's emergence and garden revival as Charged Poise closure, with felt cost of Marek's lifetime in "He was old now, truly old." Orientation anchors early in discovery scene; time compression taught via anchored reflection pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "fruit that shimmered with hues that had no names" and "sound the waterfall made when it caught light from seven suns" filter through Marek's gardener bias, constraining essence-gathering tactics; recurring garden elements charge final image of "rainbows through his grandmother's tree."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates accumulatively via fading fruits to daily ritual deepening, narrowing to breath-fed seed with agency in attention; one tightening sufficient as sprout emerges on "fortieth morning," costing time and vitality, legible in Marek's weeping and age.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved through attention emerges organically from pruning-as-creation and essence-distilling, reweighted in final image of blade-sharpening and "remind them. One fruit at a time" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to fading dreams lingers via garden's revival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in color-noticing and hush-sensing; lyrical rhythm modulates from quiet tending to charged "sprout emerged... Marek wept," purposeful compression taught early enhances accumulative texture without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "cup it... breathe in slowly, capturing its essence... exhaling gently into the soil"; varied rhythm avoids loops, purposeful figurative language integrates without muddle in peak ritual beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of interworld garden and breath-captured wonder transforms mythic tropes via grounded pruner choices; risk-taking in essence mechanics and quiet Charged Poise ending feels inevitable, heightening stakes through patient accumulation.</comment>
