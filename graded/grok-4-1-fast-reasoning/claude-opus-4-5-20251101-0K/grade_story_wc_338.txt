<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "shielded openness" balancing curiosity and caution; final typing choice earned via accumulating evidence, with cost in potential sealing vs. speaking. Interiority particular via map-framing lens on blank spaces. No safety-hedging flaws complicate her empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observed changes (pigment fade, arm flake, faces grieve, map tear) tightens to CR closure—"chapel, at last, began to whisper"—with conceptual cost of deciding its fate legible in report typing. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (chill fingertips, mold crate, drumming rain, laptop glow) filtered through map-perceiver's bias on boundaries; fresco vault and henge constrain realization at map tear, charging final shadows-reaching image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret silence) escalates via pattern break in footage comparisons, deepening knowledge at map tear; agency in rewinding/pausing narrows options to empathetic report, with cost felt in "shadows... reach toward her like hands" she endures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries/empathy emerges organically from map tear dividing known/unknown, henge on edge; final image non-literally answers by chapel whispering under her indirect gaze, reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with map-specific perceptual signature ("spaces between lines"); rhythmic control modulates from methodical to charged in peak shadows beat, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "paused both videos at the exact moment"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-reading science on "living" ancient art transforms haunted chapel trope; risk in quiet CR (whispering dawn) heightens conceptual stakes inevitably from footage pattern.</comment>
