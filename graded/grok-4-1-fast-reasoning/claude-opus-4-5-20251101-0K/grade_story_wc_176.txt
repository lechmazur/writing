<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "fingers trembled, but she continued," embodying guilt-release contradiction; final singing earned by micro-choices under pressure; no unearned epiphanies, traits constrain gentle work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to rope reconfiguration drawing aurora; RR closure in "names flow through her and solidify" with card-dust cost legible; orientation anchored early in sanctum/Elin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice walls/rope constrain choices ("one wrong movement would shatter"); aurora supplies energy for climax; sensory filter via caster's contours-noticing charges final hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (recover names) tightens texturally as hum builds/"names surfaced next"; agency in deliberate braiding forecloses forgetting with felt release-cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (permanence via release) emerges organically from wax/ropes; final "ice sang with names" reweights premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (wax-mold metaphors); rhythmic modulation accelerates in work-beats; no elision debt, diction biases to tactile resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density ("rope began to hum—not audibly, but...behind her eyes") propels without loops; varied rhythm/syntax matches pressure; zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope-as-organ punchcard synthesis transforms remembrance tropes via aurora mechanics; risk in "technically gentle" constraint heightens stakes organically.</comment>
