<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority concrete and particular, with embodied laughter and fiddle-tuck revealing contradictory impulses; earned shift from disbelief to descent motivated by observant trait and backstory cue. Minor slip in diagnostic "pixelated amnesty" phrasing feels unearned mid-epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vanish to map stabilization to trail-step Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "age was just accumulated time, not a verdict" foreclosing bridge life. Orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap and glass flake constrain choice (trail revelation) and charge final image; aspens "applauding" mirror internal shift tactilely. Sensory selection POV-biased (fiddler's observation of patterns, light thickness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim "not yet") signaled early, tightens via flake's map-focus narrowing to descent; agency in stepping off pavement forecloses prior stasis with felt age/career cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of amnesty emerges organically from flake-recount-trail arc; final "wet-plate collodion glass flake grew warm... future finally came into focus" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "never." Minor pseudo-profundity in "radical acceptance" borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing in wrap, light); rhythmic modulation peaks in "laughed... instrument of pure air." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("tell me about the thing you never became").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; propulsion strong in revelation beats. Minor overwriting in figurative stacks ("pixelated amnesty... grace") during peak map-view dulls slightly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing hitchhiker, photographic flake-map, fiddler reclaiming "not yet"; risk in magical scaffold semaphore pays off transforming tropes into inevitable closure image.</comment>
