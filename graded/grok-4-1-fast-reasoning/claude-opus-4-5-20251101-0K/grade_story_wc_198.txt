<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when "the familiar pull of the prophecy rising in her throat" clashes with her deliberate low tone, compelling the inverse melody; final shattering feels earned by decades of practice and childlessness as visible cost. Interiority concrete via embodied sensations like dewdrops on brass and throat-pull. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from low tone to complex harmonies creating interference, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing where "prophecy shatter[s] inside her mind" with grief-cost in "eerie nostalgia." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism atrium and mist constrain music's interference patterns and charge final image of dewdrops holding dawn; sensory hierarchy (mist swirling to vibration) reflects saxophonist's priorities. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal hush. Micro-setting (saxophone dew) tethers body to rite.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as music weaves "inverse of the prophecy's rhythm" against rising words, forcing patient determination; agency in absences-between-notes forecloses inheritance path with nostalgia-cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound-unmasking-sound emerges organically via vested hush motifs, reweighted in final "uncoded mornings" image without moralizing. Subtext in coded phrases' mundanity vs. viral weight invites ambiguity on inheritance. Protagonist arc inextricable from breaking chain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("stone had always been singing"); rhythmic prose modulates from patient build to dissolving note. Lyrical compression taught early via fog-light pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mist swirled in response, drawn to the vibration"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (prism fracturing music) coherent, pattern-taught without muddling climax shatter. Propulsion peaks cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical negative space silencing viral prophecy transforms inheritance trope via grotto acoustics and coded mundanity. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes. Bold voice commits fully.</comment>
