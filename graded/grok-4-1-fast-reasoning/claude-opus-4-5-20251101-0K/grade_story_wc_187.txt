<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between archival certainty and bold conjecture act in the shadow examination beat; final notation and descent choice earned by mounting fragment contradictions with felt cost of upending tradition. Interiority particular via quill's recording of heartbeat; no safety-hedging in her destructive sculpting resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of memory fragments tightening to CR closure: realization reweights history as poetry, cost legible in "Some would call this destruction" and preemptively nostalgic mourning. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene/shard to descent pays off isolation pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit brass instruments and shifting shadows constrain conjecture choice; solid fog as luminous floor charges final dawn glow and descent image. Sensory hierarchy archivist-specific (resonances over visuals); no tourist catalog, all POV-filtered urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjecturing unified memory tightens via shadow contradictions narrowing to emotional core realization; agency in aloud transcription forecloses inherited certainty path. Cost felt in identity overhaul; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as meanings over facts emerges organically from palimpsest rivers and forecourt voices; final image of chosen identity offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior certainties. No moralizing, complexity in destruction/sculpting ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archivist perceptual signature in quivering quills and vibrating foundations; rhythmic modulation builds hush cadence under realization pressure. Lyrical compression taught early via summer-quill, legible at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "every present would become a past" advancing character/atmosphere; varied rhythm, no loops despite hush motif (purposeful pattern). Minor scaffold in repeated resonance senses contained, propulsion clear to final notation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living manuscripts, shadow verification, solid fog world logic into identity-sculpting premise; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes. No template echoes, irreplaceable details like three-month bird feathers transform archival trope.</comment>
