<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's crafty motivation drives concrete micro-choices like smuggling crystal and gem calculations, with embodied grief in folding cranes; internal conflict between sorrow's weight and transformation peaks authentically. Minor epiphanic summary in "nothing truly disappears" slightly tidies the arc without unearned leap. Final endurance of luminous presence earns closure change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from workshop prep to terrace climax; orientation anchors early in tea garden pavilion. One tightening at shadow's arrival scatters/reassembles essence on-page. Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively in lantern's glow with transformation cost legible in "grief cracked open like an egg."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden and glass basilica constrain intercept via terrace elevation and smuggled crystal; jasmine/grief mists mirror internal states through selective POV filter. Sensory hierarchy narrows to shadow's wavering under pressure. Basilica's dimming charges final image, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to intercept Lin's shadow signaled early, tightens accumulatively via midnight deadline and lantern activation narrowing to prismatic capture. Agency in raising/activating forces trade-off of grief's weight for light's presence. Cost unmistakable in knees buckling and "luminous torment"; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from cranes to lantern, reweighted in final crane catch without statement. Subtext in shadow's "Mama" whisper layers complexity. Minor friction in explicit "nothing truly disappears" borders echo but avoids sermon; resonance from particulars lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in crafty observations (e.g., "seventeen polished gems"); rhythmic modulation heightens climax intensity. Lyrical diction consistent, biased toward transformation motifs. No head-hopping or elision; voice embodies Mei's desperate ingenuity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "light blazed through seventeen gems"); rhythm varies for ascent/climax. Minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("grief cracked open like an egg, spilling... dawn") risks figurative density but stays coherent. Zero loops; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami grief, dream-recording lanterns, and shadow-capture transforms loss tropes into crafty reunion; risk in floating isles/spirit tech heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from gem prep to basilica dimming. No derivatives; singular vision commits to luminous premise.</comment>
