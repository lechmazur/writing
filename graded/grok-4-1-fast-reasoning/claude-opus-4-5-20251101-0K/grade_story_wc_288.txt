<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior conflict of preservation vs. breaking pattern acts through micro-choices like descending and placing sundial; embodied tears and chest resonance earn the final fierce emergence without unearned epiphany. Contradictory grief persisting alongside new connection satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density → sundial placement → light birth → reconfiguration of purpose with legible cost in "That grief would never fully leave her." Orientation anchored early; closure Charged Poise reweights isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stone circle's atomically reflective surfaces constrain sun-angle action and charge creature birth; tidal shelves and cloud currents evolve to nest new life, mirroring internal shift in final humming library image. Micro-setting (sundial shadow) satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break isolation) signaled early via reincarnation memory; single accumulative deepening (sundial reinterpretation births creatures) narrows options under lens, with agency in placement and felt grief cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translating solitude to strength emerges via particulars like sundial shift and creature nesting; final "bridge to something beautifully, impossibly alive" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias (ancient grief-tinged wonder); diction/rhythm modulate from calcified isolation to fierce awakening, distinct texture in "songs vibrating through stone and bone." No head-hopping; 9+ perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful lyricism propels via image integration like "light fractured... winged shapes." Zero scaffold in peak creature birth; satisfies 9+ propulsion test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation chain, tidal library birthing post-extinction life transforms isolation trope; sundial reinterpretation as generations marker risks bold conceptual turn, inevitable in hindsight with risk heightening closure.</comment>
