<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in proof-by-contradiction assumption crumbling via notebook traces, earning final writing choice with felt paternal guilt cost; embodied laugh and pen-handling reveal values under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens (discoveries building density) holds with causal spine (call sparks investigation to asteroid reveal); CR closure lands in writing act reconfiguring truth-duty with unspoken burden cost, orientation anchored early in observatory/desk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's echoing acoustics and cloud-view constrain reflective isolation, charging final paper-pull image; selective sensory details (tarnished dome, burgundy stains) mirror internal orbits via POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. protection) tightens via deepening discovery narrowing reveal/suppress options; agency peaks in writing renunciation foreclosing chaos path, but world-scale stakes feel slightly telescopic against intimate desk moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of protective lies emerges organically from burgundy corrections and "orbits of regret," resonant CR reweighting paternal honesty in final nib grasp without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "in between" story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (star charts as "madman wallpaper") and rhythmic modulation (whispers echoing murmurs); no elision, diction elegant yet grounded in heiress lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and concrete images (nib "stained... burgundy"); zero loops/artifacts, rhythm breathes with scene (slow traces accelerate to laugh), closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of media control as truth-suppression orbits transforms doomsday trope; risk in solemn-playful laugh amid apocalypse heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via proof method.</comment>
