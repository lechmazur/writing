<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in curse as trap yet tool for mercy act in scene; carving earned by visions with embodied cost in "steel arms aching from the work."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tessera teaches pattern, stepping stone deepens density to soldier's hesitation; closure as Charged Poise/CR in carving and laughter echo with legible cost ("tears freezing," aching arms).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shattered sky and mosaics constrain choices (object-triggered visions) and charge final image ("warm light filtering through cold absence" mirrors mercy's persistence).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to rename tightens via deeper stone vision of hesitation; protagonist agency in "fall[ing]" into memory and carving forces trade-off with physical/emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final carving and "Emre's daughter's laughter echoed through centuries" offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of erasure vs. tenderness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (object-doorways backward); rhythm compresses immersively in visions, expands in reflection without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in vision beats; no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm peaks crisply at "letter by letter, she carved into the ancient mosaic: EMRE KAYAN."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Retrocognition as "curse" inverts power trope, synthesizing object-memories with post-fire mercy preservation; carving turn inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
