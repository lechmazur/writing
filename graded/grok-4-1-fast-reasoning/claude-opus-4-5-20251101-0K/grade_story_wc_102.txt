<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei-Lin's motivation rooted in past-life memory compels her healing choice with embodied tension in trembling hands and breath-reading expertise; old woman applies crucible pressure without stock shallowness. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "forgiveness implied separation" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered observations building to CR closure in final image of spiraling sparks reweighting unused love's storage with conceptual cost of eternal pilgrimage. Orientation anchors viaduct/Mei-Lin/camera by para 2; single scene causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's jasmine/fog constrains observation and charges final image, mirroring internal release; sensory hierarchy (breath halos, amber glow) filters through Mei-Lin's luminous bias. Micro-setting of camera obscura as tool shapes all choices without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locating unused love) signaled early tightens accumulatively through breath darkening to luminous release, forcing Mei-Lin's instructional agency with felt cost in woman's grief and her ongoing quest. Escalation coheres under lens with one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love's storage emerges organically via breath patterns and jasmine reprise, culminating in non-literal CR that reweights premise without moralizing; final blur-into-truth image resonates with prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward luminous trails; dialogue subtextual ("Your breath carries someone else's sorrow") advances healing without exposition. Rhythmic modulation peaks in release scene without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "jasmine vines...glowed amber"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Dense figurative layer in climax ("luminous threads rising like prayers") borders overwrite but pattern-taught; minor paraphrase in breath descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Camera obscura revealing breath-love transforms spiritual trope into tactile mechanics; past-life pendant-to-camera evolution feels inevitable, risking lyrical closure that heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
