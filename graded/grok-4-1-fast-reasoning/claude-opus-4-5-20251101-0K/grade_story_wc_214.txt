<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deep interiority and embodied vulnerability arc shine in "Vulnerability had once terrified her... this smallness had become her strength," earning endurance with felt cost of solitude; no pressure-tested micro-choices slightly limits peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final lantern image reweighting abandonment as vigil; orientation anchors early, cost legible in "her life was a single breath in the cosmos's long exhale."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "moss grew between the observatory's stones" and lantern constrain perception and charge final "glowed like a small captured sun"; selective sensory filter reflects POV priorities without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Internal stake of embracing stillness deepens via meteor trace with textural cadence shift narrowing to endurance; lacks external reversal or live option foreclosure, keeping pressure more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from particulars like star paths and lantern transform, resonating in non-literal final image without moralizing; invites lingering ambiguity on solitude's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in "trajectories told stories if one listened properly"; rhythmic control modulates beautifully under reflective intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in image-driven lines like "falling became flying"; minor paraphrase loops in stillness repetitions ("quiet rebellion," "flourishing stillness") dull momentum slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor in abandoned station transforms solitude trope via yellow glass poetry; lantern's "endings became beginnings" feels inevitable and risks bold lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
