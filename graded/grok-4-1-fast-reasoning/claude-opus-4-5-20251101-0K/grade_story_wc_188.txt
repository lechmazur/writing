<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—grief's weight versus defiant purpose—act in chanting and knot-handling; grandmother's return forces micro-choice to ignite, earning transformation with Tomás's felt absence as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from mosaic message directing to tower (causal seed) to fireworks shattering void as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "smoke remained, drifting between blooming vines" reconfiguring grief's before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic tiles constrain path via message and charge climax by "multiplying" fireworks light into walls' celebration, evolving with nightfall's starless canvas to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled in chants deepens via grandmother's reveal and knot-return, narrowing to performance agency; escalation accumulates density to display, with emotional cost in "burn brighter for his absence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fireworks as non-literal answer to "transform grief into light" reweights knot/chants/particulars; resonance emerges from display's refusal of darkness without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of "ambient awareness" and chanting rhythms biases noticing (vines gasping, mosaics shifting); sparse dialogue distinguishes idioms, modulating to charged poise at fuses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with "flame leaped like something liberated" propels climax rhythm; no loops, varied syntax breathes with emotional peaks, zero artifacts dulling fireworks shatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic-note invitation and faked-death reunion transforms fireworks trope into grief's textural alchemy, risking bold payoff in sky-shattering refusal of void.</comment>
