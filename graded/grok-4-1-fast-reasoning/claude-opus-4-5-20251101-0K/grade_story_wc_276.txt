<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of cool-headed fisher through patience in spike-clutching and silence-voicing, with contradictory grief/hope via colors compelling the climax choice; final release earned by prior emotional buildup without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising to garden shift and silence climax; on-page RR closure via echo ("Mama. Don't blame the water.") reconfigures grief with legible emotional cost in buckling knees and unnamed colors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's humming gravel and resonance fountain constrain spike-planting choice and charge final fade; recurring stars pause during silence, mirroring internal release and recharging Unraveling premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo) signaled early tightens via goddess's demand, forcing silence-agency that forecloses reserved path; cost felt in embodied whisper settling into bones, under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterned release emerges implicitly from spike colors matching constellations, answered non-literally by "fish for stars" image reweighting blame/water without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with fisher-biased perceptual signature (vibrations as water-like) stable in single POV; goddess dialogue subtextual ("voicing silence") advances under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sonic metaphors (e.g., "chord struck on strings") propelling to silence beat; zero loops, rhythmic variety peaks in "pure, absolute silence given form."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fantasy (emotion-spike, resonance fountain) transforms grief trope via fisher's star-reaching echo; risk of lyric accumulation heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
