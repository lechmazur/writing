<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mei's motivation rooted in grandmother's aphasia and lace decoding compels reconciliation choice, with embodied emotion in tracing knots; internal conflict via regrets acts simultaneously in scene. Grandmother's pleading eyes and finger on "I know" loop earn change with relational cost. Mr. Tanaka's delivery of lace forces pivotal micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density deepens from lace patterns revealing backstory to compass pointing cottage, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as they trace knots—"face crumpled into something raw and relieved"—with 50-year emotional cost legible on page. Orientation anchored early (Mei on islet post-rain). Single scene with clear movement; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Islet post-rain (wet rocks, mist, tide whisper) filters through Mei's bias, constraining via compass swing to cottage and charging final window image. Cerulean light/sky mirrors unspoken apologies without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy selective (auditory tide, tactile lace) integrates into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile unspoken regrets) signaled early via aphasia; accumulative deepening via lace decoding narrows knowledge/options, forcing Mei to kneel and trace "I was wrong" knot. Agency in following instructions forecloses silence path; cost felt in grandmother's crumpling face. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invented languages for regret emerges organically from lace knots (regret/forgiveness) and compass, reweighting via final image: "weave their reconciliation through the ancient lace" answers how apologies find home without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures; ambiguity lingers in "colors of regret." No tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Mei; perceptual signature in tidal/memory metaphors ("pulling memories toward the horizon"). Voice rhythmic, modulating with intensity—"syllables unfurling like a careful leaf" distinguishes Tanaka's slow speech. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (e.g., "She wanted to tell you why").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, though minor metaphor density ("drowning in everything unsaid") coherent. Propulsion via image integration—"compass needle steadied, pointing toward the cottage"—charges beats. Clean mechanics; read-aloud flows without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lace as encoded apology language + ghost compass transforms reconciliation trope; "knots that meant regret" inflects via particulars. Risk in accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from early tide/compass seeds.</comment>
