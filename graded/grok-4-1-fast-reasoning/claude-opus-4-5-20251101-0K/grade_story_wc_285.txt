<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's superstitious needle-touch and sensory attunement reveal contradictory impulses of memory and duty; final gift earns change with personal cost. Woman's confession elicits micro-choice response, deepening relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density builds to gutters' silence ("The gutters... had finally stopped ticking"), enabling Charged Poise closure via needle handover and safe dock emergence with conceptual continuity cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>River fog and rope constrain coachman's choices, filtering through his expertise ("I listen. I feel."); needle as recurring object charges final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of treacherous crossing tightens accumulatively via gutter-ticking countdown, forcing endurance; woman's promise stake braids in, with agency in attentive pulling and relational needle cost legible at handover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Palimpsest promise motif emerges organically from dialogue and coachman's fog-reading parallel, reweighted in needle gift ("For mending what's been torn") as non-literal answer to buried truths' complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with coachman's perceptual signature ("The fog speaks if you let it"); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic, advancing stakes via implication without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm matching pulls ("hand over hand"); zero loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks in "far dock emerged from the mist like a memory returning."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory navigation as textual mending transforms ferry trope; needle's shroud heritage risks bold handover, heightening thematic stakes organically.</comment>
