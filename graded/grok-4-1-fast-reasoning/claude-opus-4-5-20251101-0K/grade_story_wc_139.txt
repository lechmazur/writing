<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maya's "I never lie" trait drives consistent rebellion and compels the closure choice, with contradictory loyalty and integrity embodied in her approach to Mr. Chen; Mr. Chen applies relational pressure that reveals her values hierarchy without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via dialogue density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("fair trades...transform"); ink pot handover as decisive final beat with felt relational cost legible in "we're even"; oriented early in prep room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ink pot and body constrain choices (e.g., "placed the ink pot in her hands") and charge final image ("ink pot caught the streetlight"); sensory details (formaldehyde, floral) filter through Maya's priorities, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair debt settlement) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through revelations narrowing Mr. Chen's stance; agency in Maya's choice to come forces handover with relational cost ("tell him we're even").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative trades emerges organically from ink pot's reprise, reweighting debts without statement; final image ("fair trades don't balance. They transform") offers non-literal resonant answer to Maya's question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (e.g., "mathematics of a fair trade"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You're not lying"), distinguishing voices via idiom; rhythmic control modulates revelation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., varying sentence rhythm in handover); no loops or artifacts, though minor synonym echoes ("waiting") don't touch closure; clean mechanics support ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of generational theft, asylum debt, and embalming transforms con artist trope via ink pot's weighted history; risk in quiet CR closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
