<comment>Elena's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "rage could settle into something almost meditative," driving the earned shift to speaking; flaws (fear of loss) complicate the envelope choice with visible cost of silence broken. Contradictory impulses act in the timer-beat hesitation, satisfying 9+ test. No unearned epiphanies; voice particular.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density (scars, pauses, lightning) builds to RR/CR closure in "lifted the old telescope... and began to speak," reweighting scars as maps with undeniable cost of seven-year silence; timer tightens once decisively. Orientation anchored in opening climb; cost legible in raspy voice image.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stormlit dome and lightning constrain vigil (illuminates envelope, answers thunder), charging final telescope aim; sensory hierarchy (visual flashes over sound) reflects poetic urgency. Micro-setting (timer, timetable) guides choices; 9+ test met via environment shaping resurrection image. No white-room; evolved with flashes.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (scar cartography) signaled early, tightens via timer revelation narrowing silence-to-speech options under accumulative lens; agency in pressing timer and breaking seal forecloses retreat with raspy-voice cost. Escalation driven by protagonist; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. 9+ test: agency unmistakable, cost on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (scars as maps/resistance) emerges organically from particulars like note "The scars are maps. Follow them home," reweighting premise in final speaking image without moralizing. Resonance from motif shift (damage to navigation); 9+ test: non-literal answer recharges priors. No platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("shadow alphabets," "storm-kissed wonder"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "raspy... fierce and precise." Prose texture distinct, biased to scars/storm; 9+ test: signature holds under pressure, no elision issues. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High density propels (e.g., "oxymoron made weather" purposeful, not muddled); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, clarity in peak timer-chime beat. Opening anchors stakes, final recharges motifs; 9+ test: zero scaffold, propulsion clean. Minor figurative density coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's vigil, darkroom ghosts, scars-as-maps transforms resistance tropes; envelope revelation feels inevitable from priors. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; non-obvious observatory frame memorable. Minor familiarity in censored artist arc tempers peak.</comment>
