<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's love for Maren's deadly presence shows contradictory impulses in scene ("beautiful, deadly, necessary"), earning the final bead-pressing with embodied cost. Maren's duality drives guidance and release. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: beads accumulate resonance to closure's RR (Charged Poise in dawn/Maren's dissolution). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in "her form flickered, began to dissolve like morning frost" with world's shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse/quicksilver/stream constrain choices (bead placement, roots pulsing) and charge final image (streams glow gold, glass cracks). Sensory hierarchy (luminescent fruit, whispering streams) reflects Elias's priorities. Recurrent soil/beads evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "resonant awakenings" and bead-pressing narrowing to release. Agency in Elias's act forecloses eternal night with emotional cost. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (sacrifice yields light) emerges from particulars like beads/roots, answered non-literally in Maren's "it was worth it" and Elias's "mournful elation... too vast to bear." Final image reweights curse/blessing inseparably. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Elias's perceptual signature (e.g., "fingers brushing... frozen cobwebs"). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity; dialogue subtextual ("The night ends"). No head-hopping; elision taught via cameos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "roots drank from quicksilver streams that whispered secrets") propels without loops; rhythm varies (short punchy sentences at climax). Figuratives coherent/purposeful in accumulative texture; no scaffold or muddle touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ghost-debt into generational resonance transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to dawn's inevitability. Premise feels organic/inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
