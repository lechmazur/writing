<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's frugal rationalism clashes with transcendent devotion in contradictory impulses like dismissing mysticism yet kneeling before the lapis tile; micro-choices (secondhand gear, cheap case) reveal values under pressure, earning the final renunciation of fame for 17-year isolation with embodied tremble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify into primes and orbital parameters; on-page CR closure lands in "the unknown had answered... had been heard," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of patient exile legible in tile-packing and descent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magic square tile as micro-setting constrains mapping choices and charges closure via packing; reimagined palace's empty halls and clerestory light filter POV priorities, evolving from opportunity to silent erasure without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant via stars) signaled early tightens accumulatively through hour-by-hour pattern break (primes emerge) driven by Mira's persistence; cost unmistakable in trembling hands and foreseen dismissal, foreclosing political paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion emerges organically from math-altar tension, resonating in final image of bridge from numbers without moralizing; reweights rationalism via ironic patterns, inviting ambiguity of cosmic reply with thematic cost of solitary fidelity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward mathematical precision ("sums equaled thirty-four"); rhythmic diction modulates from dusky lyricism to charged poise at "carrying her encrypted devotion homeward," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images ("love letters could be written in cipher"); zero loops or scaffolds, rhythmic variety peaks clean in closure beat without figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian magic squares as alien decoder transforms tropes via frugal empiricism; risk of lyric astronomy pays off in inevitable CR hindsight, heightening cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
