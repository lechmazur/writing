<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy drives the arc credibly, with interiority concrete in seasonal observations, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure—no micro-choices test her "quietly driven" trait against opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers of postcards, glass, and realizations build density to CR closure in the mural's transformative purpose; cost felt in grandmother's unfulfilled life and Mira's ongoing autumn returns; orientation anchored early in pavilion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion's etched glass constrains discovery and charges final image of light animating figures; sensory details like "umbral tenderness" and melting snow evolve purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding night blooms tightens accumulatively via glass layers' revelation, narrowing to intimacy-for-shadow-dwellers with felt cost in grandmother's insomnia; lacks agency-testing reversal but coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of darkness-offered beauty emerges from particulars like moonflowers for moths, reweighting premise in final mural congregation without moralizing; resonant CR answers grandmother's question via "blooms for those who might otherwise believe that nothing beautiful existed for them."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in light/shadow filters stable single POV; rhythmic modulation suits dawning hush, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid, integrated imagery propels via varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; peak realization ("It wasn't a flower at all") clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical mystery, cathedral glass layers, and mural for insomniacs transforms inheritance trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes toward inevitable CR.</comment>
