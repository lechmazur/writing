<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Empathetically decisive nature shown concretely when she wipes tears "with vigorous, purposeful strokes, refusing to let sentiment slow her work," rooting motivation in town's fractures; interiority particular via sound obsession. No deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of languages and elevator responses builds to Charged Poise closure where silos harmonize, reweighting isolation with felt emotional cost in tears and heart-held weight. Orientation anchored early in clock tower; one tightening via chord suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astronomical clock's procession and dome's starlight constrain perception and charge final image; sensory hierarchy sound-dominant via POV bias as choral librarian. Cuckoo weight as micro-setting evolves tactilely, mirroring harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate silos) escalates accumulatively via deepening responses to full chord, narrowing isolation with agency in broadcasts; cost legible in tears refusing slowdown. No reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic bridges from isolation emerges via particulars like elevator hums echoing human divides; final wheat-wind sound offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silos metaphor, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with sound-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates tenderly ("rippling through cables") to vigorously ("purposeful strokes"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful language lists build texture without loops. Minor synonym churn in "bridges" motif slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh premise of language-taught silo choir transforms isolation trope organically; risk in acoustic community synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes via harbor metaphor without gimmickry.</comment>
