<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in decoded patterns and desperation compels the broadcast choice with embodied stress ("hum in her teeth, her bones"). Interior contradiction emerges in "cautiously hopeful at best," balancing competence with struggle, earning her endurance. Final preparation for "next battle" shows renunciation of easy victory with ongoing cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal isolation leads to transmitter build, powering up triggers recoil and procession falter. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (basement, WXHU, charts). Closure as Charged Poise in "signal decay" and "silence... most human sound," with conceptual cost of perpetual war legible in final chart pullout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constraints via "reinforced metal welded shut" and "modified transmitter on console" shape isolation and climax broadcast. Sensory hierarchy (burnt coffee, subsonic hum in "liquid of her eyes") narrows under crisis, charging final oscilloscope reflection. 9+ gate met: console/tools constrain choice and ghost image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spoil harvest before demolition) tightens causally via watch ("47 minutes") to broadcast turning signal stutter. Agency in modulating "uncertainty... curiosity" forecloses division path with felt recoil cost. Escalation driven by her choice, cost unmistakable in faltering voices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of discord as farmed chaos emerges organically from signal's emotional payload vs. her dissonance counter. Final "silence... human sound" resonantly reweights premise without moral, satisfying 9+ test via image shift. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (astronomical "concentric circles," signal as "not sound"). Rhythm modulates tension (short sentences in broadcast: "Good."). Minimal dialogue natural ("Chen! Open this door!"), goal-driven panic. 9+ test: signature holds under pressure, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "charts fluttered... hum in her teeth" advances action/embodiment/atmosphere). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; rhythm varies for propulsion. Opening anchors stakes, final line recharges silence motif cleanly. 9+ test passed: zero artifacts, propulsion peaks at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subsonic emotional farming countered by "dissonance" via salvaged tech transforms invasion trope. Risk in "grammar" of alien signal heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passed: specifics (Proxima relay, Sagittarius A) anchor cosmic scale to basement grit.</comment>
