<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like following forgotten visions shown in driftwood arrangement; final realization earned by causal buildup, confronting flaw of forgetting with cost. Precognitively forgetful trait drives micro-choices without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from echoes to chalk map of partings (CR closure), reweighting prophecies with mercy of forgetting; cost legible in "photographed the chalk markings... knowing the image would corrupt." Orientation anchored early; single tightening via writing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog sculptures constrain path via driftwood markers and shifting forms; sensory hierarchy (fog breath, chalk dust) filters through POV urgency, charging final dispersal image. Micro-setting (flat stone) enables pivotal writing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate vision's residue before fog lifts) signaled early, textural deepening via map reveals unbearable futures, narrowing to endurance; agency in markers/writing, cost in chalk depletion and slipping memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgetting's mercy emerges organically from chalk map and dispersing fog; final image reconfigures prior echoes without moralizing, resonant CR with conceptual cost of knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (residues, echoes) modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure without elision costs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from arrangement to map; no loops/artifacts, rhythm breathes with scene—e.g., chalk stub wearing "to nothing" accelerates peak without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog sculptures and forgetful prophecy transforms precog trope; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens inevitability of CR, specific details like videotape hush anchor originality.</comment>
