<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in specific loss (forgetting Theo's laugh) compels ritual choices; embodied ache at apparition's tilt earns pivotal renunciation of finding him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to equations glowing and mosaic shudder, landing CR in "solving for herself" with acceptance cost legible in warmer eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss and dripping stalactites constrain ritual (moss equations, drip rhythm) and charge final brighter orchard image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively via quantified grief (half-life of hope) to apparition reversal, forcing endurance with felt cost in chest ache, though some abstraction mutes peak viscerality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Apparition's "space between your equations" offers non-literal reweighting of loss-mapping premise, emerging organically from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (reading chipped tiles as variables) holds under pressure through clean third-limited POV, modulating rhythmically to closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; minor elevated diction in reflective beats (stranger wounds) doesn't obscure glowing climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of taxidermy-conjuring via emotion math transforms ambiguous loss trope, with mosaic equations as inevitable fresh turn.</comment>
