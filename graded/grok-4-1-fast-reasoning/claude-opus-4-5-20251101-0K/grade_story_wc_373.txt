<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via watch fob crescents and father's legacy compelling steadfast micro-choices; past failures earn final guardian reconfiguration without closure slips, though brief backstory summaries slightly dilute present pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from past intercepts to third-try success; on-page closure as Decisive Change (cylinder caught, escape) with legible cost in "hammering heart" and dawn pressure shaping final emergence image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eel tank reflection and narrow passages constrain interception and escape choices; rotting pier anchors sensory urgency, charging closure as Eliza emerges into dawn light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart deal pre-sunrise) tightens via agency-driven third attempt after false starts, foreclosing failure option with felt nerve cost; no reversal overload, pressure coheres causally to charged escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Truce of hush emerges organically from silence motif and betrayal sound stakes, resonating in final "keeper of silence" image without moralizing; reweights legacy from runner to guardian with thematic cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (watch fob warmth as father proxy); sparse dialogue ("Clumsy") natural and goal-driven; rhythmic diction modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (lanterns swinging, eels writhing); varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor metaphor density in opening risks slight overwriting without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-betrayal artifact in hush-truce underworld transforms pirate market tropes; risk in "frequency of betrayal" premise heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
