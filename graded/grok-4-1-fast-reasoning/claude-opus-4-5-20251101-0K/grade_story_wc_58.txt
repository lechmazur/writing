<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with thread grooves and cold seeping revealing grief under pressure; motivation rooted in vocation intensifies to compel obituary-writing choice. Final endurance of absence as precious earned by projecting brother's presence. Minor abstract epiphany phrasing slightly dilutes contradiction in peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from garden isolation to writing climax; on-page CR closure in placing pages and braiding thread reconfigures healing with emotional cost felt in "grooves into her finger." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's maple leaves "color of dried blood" and persimmons selectively mirror internal erosion, constraining isolation and charging final leaf descent. Recurrent thread as micro-setting handled tactilely evolves to braid, grounding closure image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward absence records.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map own grief signaled early, escalates accumulatively via projection and seven-page obituary deepening knowledge with embodied cost (stiff joints, thread grooves). Agency in writing/renunciation forecloses uncharted path; final poise reweights with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges organically from vocation, brother's letter, and leaves; final image of thread-as-map offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like sparrow and promised stones avoid platitudes, reweighting loss as practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in phrases like "lonesome splendor of autumn"; diction/rhythm modulate from quiet reflection to charged dawn realization. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "maple leaves the color of dried blood and persimmons left too long in the sun"; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors. Final line's cadence shift recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms grief tropes via obituaries-for-living vocation into fresh "geography of healing" frame; thread's evolution from loose strand to braid inflects riskily yet inevitably. Bold lyric reflection heightens stakes organically.</comment>
