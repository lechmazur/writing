<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gear-handling and sonar activation reveal contradictory impulses of detached witness versus active intervener, earning final hope-bearing transit with fragile cost legible in "troubling serenity remained."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to sonar revelation and gear-turning CR, reweighting patterns in transmission image with conceptual cost of "most civilizations would still choose fire."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula flowers as light-collectors constrain release method, charging final blooming beacon that mirrors interrupted patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pattern-breaking escalates accumulatively via sonar-gear harmony, agency in turning forecloses combustion path with cost in fragile, extinguishable hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transmission and petal-fall image resonantly answer fire inevitability without moral, reweighting failures through light's "single thread... into possibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature—sonar "painting images"—and rhythmic modulation from serene drift to harmonic crescendo sustain cosmic POV without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; density peaks propulsively in "cascading waves of pure illumination," with varied syntax amplifying resonance climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gear's calibration frequency synthesizes destruction equations into resonance-light, transforming cosmic witness trope via inevitable pattern-break hindsight.</comment>
