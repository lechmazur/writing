<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in reverse flashes acting simultaneously with present steps, earning closure choice of disintegration; "her consciousness perpetually sliding into the past" embodies flaw without labels. Minor reflection summaries tilt present micro-choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to CR closure; cost legible in "felt herself begin to disintegrate—not painfully, but like a sigh releasing." Orientation anchored early; shards taught by flashes pay off without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Garden's hyperbolic bridges constrain climax choice and charge final image ("branches curving in new directions"); sensory selection (teeth ache from hum) reflects maze-designer POV bias. Details evolve causally post-disintegration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape trap via time's texture) deepens texturally via realization ("photographs...dissolving back into the temporal cloth"), narrowing to agency-driven disintegration with body-unwinding cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time as weave/garden) emerges organically from fabric image shifting at "She saw it then—not a river or a line, but a fabric"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "become the answer yourself."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in maze/time metaphors ("geometry itself seemed to breathe"); stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation to charged poise at ending. Lyric compression taught early via flashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bridges curved in ways that Euclidean space shouldn't permit" advances setting/plot/voice); zero loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors build to "threads of experience unwinding." Rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, time-fabric transforms tropes; risk in disintegration-as-bloom heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fragment/garden interplay.</comment>
