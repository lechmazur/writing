<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses—survivor's incompleteness vs. bleak exhilaration—embodied in geode handling and calculations; final endurance earned via causal buildup to pattern recognition. Micro-choices under breaker timer reveal values hierarchy. Backstory anchors tilt present hunt without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reflection to data spike, culminating in CR closure ("geode warm... unbearably real") reweighting quest with conceptual cost of non-resurrection. Orientation anchored early (observatory, post-wedding survival). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory and clouds constrain via breakers' timer and isolation, charging final image; selective sensory (fogged viewport, groaning winds) mirrors internal state through POV bias. Micro-setting (geode, console) guides choices purposefully. No white-room; vivid, lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt unused potential) signaled early, deepens via spike/pattern with agency in repeated calculations; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift narrows to "blueprint" realization, cost legible in isolation and non-resurrection. One tightening sufficient, charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of alternatives to cruelty emerges organically from geode's shift (hollow beauty, intangible to real) and quantum hunt; final image reweights premise without moralizing—"unused potential was not the same as wasted hope." Resonant, complex ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (scientific-poetic: "clouds... resembled brain tissue"); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity, perceptual bias selective. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression purposeful under timer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short chirp beats amid longer reflections); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs—e.g., "hollow things... beauty in darkness" purposeful, integrated. Propulsion aligns with scene urgency; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drone survivor's quantum hunt transforms guilt into "unused potential" map; risk in bleak exhilaration tone heightens stakes organically. Premise non-obvious, particulars (perturbation, geode) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
