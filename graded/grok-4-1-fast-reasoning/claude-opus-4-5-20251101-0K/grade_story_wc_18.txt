<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction in final breaths ("breathed against it, breaking the synchronization"), earning the renunciation; motivation intensifies through 17-year craft to charged poise without epiphanic shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from fog pulse to mirror vision, delivering Charged Poise closure in "The vision faded... But now she knew the way" with legible opportunity cost of delayed crossing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog and twilight frost constrain breathing sync and charge final image ("fog closed behind her... More like invitation"); selective sensory weave (pulse, violet mist) mirrors internal dissolution without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture dream) tightens via agency in synchronized exhale yielding vision, then deepening renunciation forecloses immediate crossing with felt patience cost; lens escalation reweights to invitational fog.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as invitation emerges organically from particulars (mirrors catching unseen, breath weaving seen/unseen), resonant in final reconfiguration without statement; glass mountains reprise shifts capture to joining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (frost as "writing," spires "sang") biases through mirror-maker lens, rhythmic control heightens pressure in sync breaths; stable close third-person with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful repetition (breath/fog); no loops or muddle, peak clarity in "mirrors caught... Glass mountains" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escaped dream navigated via sextant-mirrors transforms boundary-erasure trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive yields inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
