<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's methodical cataloguing of grief as "verb forms" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final "She wept, kindly and methodically, cataloguing each tear" earns closure choice with embodied emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discoveries (tablet, seed, growth) deepen stake toward CR closure; fruit-bite realization reweights transition premise with tearful cost on "every transition she had ever witnessed flowing through her."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic soil constrains planting, glowing fruit charges tasting climax; sideways trees mirror internal shifts, filtering through translator's biased perception of "roots threading through lodestones."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to grasp transition physics signaled early, deepens via tablet/fruit forcing agency in planting/eating; emotional cost legible in weeping, charging final image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fruit bite offers resonant answer to transition question, reweighting ambitions via tasted "current through copper" without moral; emerges organically from seed/tablet particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with analogical perceptual signature ("seed was like a cuneiform sign"); minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden in caretaker's sparse lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "glowing faintly blue" integrate without muddle, though opening cluster risks slight overload away from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lodestone arbor synthesizing linguistics and soul physics transforms quest trope; planting-to-tasting arc feels inevitable, risking bold world logic without retreat.</comment>
