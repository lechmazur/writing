<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Marcus's shift from urbane calligraphy to subversive puppets act vividly in the performance, earning the mutual reconfiguration with relational cost; Vera's serene denial of tears reveals embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in the dust symbols (listening + ?), reconfiguring stances with felt relational cost; orientation anchored immediately in dome and post-argument hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's curved walls and acoustics constrain and amplify the puppet shadows, charging the half-light epiphany; recurring "meteor hush" and Pacific surf evolve to mirror internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical storytelling clash tightens accumulatively through puppet reversal, narrowing options with vulnerability cost legible in Vera's tears; agency in performance forecloses prior opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-lit epiphanies emerge organically from puppet reversal and dust symbols, offering non-literal answer to storytelling ethics without moralizing; resonance reweights prior argument in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Marcus's perceptual bias (shifting faces on stick) and distinct dialogue idioms (Vera's factual pushback); rhythmic modulation heightens hush without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in acoustic echoes and shadow play; no loops or artifacts, metaphors like "fallen moon" cohere without muddle in peak puppet beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppets in seedy bars and dome intimacy transforms ethical storytelling trope; risk in subversive performance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
