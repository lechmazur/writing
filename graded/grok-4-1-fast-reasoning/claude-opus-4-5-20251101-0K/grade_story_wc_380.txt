<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation intensifies from hollow ache to palm-pressing the sphere, earning inheritance via bloodline recognition; contradictory obey-then-defy impulses act in scene with visible cost of foreclosed dock life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as coffee pattern triggers descent, sphere crack deepens knowledge, culminating in Charged Poise at door-step with conceptual cost of reality boundary crossed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt chamber's gravity fluctuations constrain navigation ("hair lifted... knees buckled"), charging sphere interaction and mirroring memory sediment; recurring "gleaming silence" evolves to frame final door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery tightens at memory pour ("bargain, trading herself"), forcing inheritance stance; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens forecloses harbor normalcy visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of stepping through reweights erasure as displaceable sediment without moralizing, emerging organically from sphere vortex and bloodline seal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature favors overlooked patterns (grounds, key), modulating rhythm with pressure; mother's whisper carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The sphere cracked open. Inside was not emptiness but density"); zero loops, metaphors consistent without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity as reality tears synthesizing whale-carried prison with memory deletion feels inevitable via mother's boundary-keeping, transforming tropes boldly.</comment>
