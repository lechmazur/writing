<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's molting trait creates contradictory impulses acting in scene (new self but hands remember the dance), earning final endurance with relational cost; Ezra applies pressure as catalyst without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories/reflections tightens to present sorting under patrols' threat; Charged Poise closure ("Always together. Always under stars") reconfigures fragility as bloom with conceptual cost of rusted impermanence legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library/stars constrain choices (moonlit work hides from patrols) and charge final image; sensory details (stained fingers, rattling pennies) filtered through Mira's priorities mirror blooming fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustaining fragile resistance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Ezra's arrival/shipment amid patrols; endurance forecloses destruction path with felt cost of visibility/invisibility in rusted sanctuary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges organically from particulars (prison books to starlit shelves, molting selves); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("resistance blooms in fractures") reweighting chaos as beauty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (luminous/cracked imagery tied to Mira); dialogue natural/subtextual ("bloom where they salt the earth") advances stake; rhythmic prose modulates with quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "fractured light through broken glass") supporting tone without muddle or loops; every line propels accumulative texture to charged closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting survivor and penny poet forging resistance via libraries transforms dystopian tropes; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of fragility without gimmickry.</comment>
