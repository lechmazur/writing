<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely through chest pressure, racing heart, and throat tightening, with contradictory impulses acting in the crawl ("Her claustrophobia screamed. Her determination answered louder"), compelling the final endurance with emotional cost tied to grandmother's legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly: organ sequence → panel opens → crawl → unlock, delivering on-page Decisive Change (door swings open) reconfiguring stakes into Charged Poise amid archives, with claustrophobic cost legible in the chamber emergence; orientation anchored by ~50 words, single scene defaults met.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ruins, rubble, tight passage, and organ constrain choices vividly (e.g., "horizontal passage barely three feet high"), with sensory details like dust motes in moonbeams and tooth-aching C note filtering through POV bias; spatial choreography coherent, charging final crack-in-ceiling dawn image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Meridian Key) signaled early tightens via crawl reversal narrowing options under claustrophobia, with agency in enduring crawl and unlock foreclosing fear's path; cost felt in bodily negotiation, though no further complication post-unlock slightly limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny theme emerges organically from fear-conquered crawl to wistful archive vigil, reweighting premise in final grandmother reflection without moralizing; resonance in bells blessing discovery avoids tidy morals, lingering on rebellion's grief-cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of enclosure-threat (walls "lean inward with malicious intent"); rhythmic prose modulates tension elegantly, diction character-bound without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length through crawl tension; minor "spatial mutiny" recurrence taught early feels voice-motivated, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of photographing amid dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Organ-reverberation reveal transforms artifact-hunt trope via claustrophobic calculus and grandmother inheritance; fresh "spatial mutiny" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk in tight-space climax heightening emotional stakes organically.</comment>
