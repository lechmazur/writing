<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied skills in sound identification and maintenance knowledge drive Celia's choices, with micro-decisions like using whispers revealing hierarchy of values; man's motivation rooted in father's legacy compels credible endurance through maze. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in Celia keeps it from 9+; no internal conflict beyond competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: footsteps cue following, key-as-template moment decisively narrows path to hidden container, landing Charged Poise closure with felt effort cost in storm navigation. Orientation anchored early in labyrinth/port/storm; no lens ambiguity, full 9+ test met with constraint on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth constrains every choice via sound echoes, rust, passages; storm's aurora and interference narrow perception, charging final container reveal. Recurrent shipping containers and whispers mirror internal secrets theme without overt symbolism; body/setting integration at peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding legacy) signaled early, tightens via key-map reversal narrowing to maintenance paths; Celia's agency to lead forecloses outsider routes with visible trust cost. Stakes low-key but coherent under causal lens; no strong opposition beyond environment limits escalation punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient secrets/whispers emerges organically from sound navigation, folded maps, final journals; man's philosophy line integrates without moralizing, resonant CR in whispered thanks and labyrinth holding close. Final image reweights premise non-literally; full 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Celia with perceptual bias to sounds/paths; dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're not supposed to be here"), distinct voices in rhythm/idiom. Prose texture modulates tension; no head-hopping, rhythmic control under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels through maze beats; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle—"whispers traveled farther" motif purposeful without overwriting. Clean propulsion peaks at key-template reveal; zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of sound-ID navigation, key-as-map-template turn, aurora-lit maze transforms tropes; fresh angle on hidden knowledge feels inevitable from particulars. Risky ceremonial footsteps hook pays off; non-obvious payoff elevates.</comment>
