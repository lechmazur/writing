<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spatial gift yields concrete interiority and embodied emotion, with micro-choices like laser presses revealing values under grief pressure. Final weeping earns closure renunciation of rupture for permeability, foreclosing tidy release. Minor slip: epiphany line ("That was letting go") borders diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in farm traversal and insights; CR closure reconfigures boundaries premise with emotional cost legible in final image of weeping amid blaze. Orientation anchored early (Maya in brother's farm pre-dawn). One tightening: ghost mushroom kneel reframes relationship map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent specifics (Panellus stipticus absorbing laser) constrain spatial sensing and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, integrating via action (kneeling, pressing). Mushrooms mirror internal states purposefully without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations narrowing to permeability acceptance. Agency in exploration forecloses rupture path with weeping cost. Guardrail met: tightening forces trade-off in final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Permeability theme emerges organically from mushroom physics and relationship mapping, resonant non-literal answer in "hold everything... all at once." No moralizing; final image reweights prior distance/presence tension. Complexity lingers in grief's thin membranes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial perceptual signature distinct ("invisible geometries"); rhythmic control modulates from fluid grace to steady breath. POV stable, compression purposeful in lyric insights. Elevated diction fits grief lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task image/insight (e.g., "red dot... defied optics"). No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent ("quiet wildfire"). Zero figurative muddle in peak weep beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion detection/spatial gift with bioluminescent grief physics transforms loss trope. Risky lyric mapping feels inevitable; mushroom barriers as love/grief membrane heightens stakes organically.</comment>
