<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reflective locksmith's contradictory impulses (peripheral focus vs. urge to directly observe) act in scene; final gentle recording earned by indirect work with trembling cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds to on-page CR closure (harvest release reconfigures preservation premise) with conceptual cost in terrifying wonder; timer constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's crystalline geometry constrains tactics (angle mappings, light-sound link) and charges final image of stored voices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (harvest echoes) signaled early, tightens via mechanism fix to release; agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens culminates in felt cost of vast wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final notebook/sitting offers resonant non-literal answer to mechanism-vs-mystery tension, reweighting premise through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mechanism metaphors, indirect noticing) with rhythmic control building to release; stable limited POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (multi-job lines like gear filing by candleheart); rhythm propels from setup to peak voices without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acoustic "harvest" premise freshly synthesized via locksmith reverse-engineering; risk in temporal compression heightens lyric stakes coherently.</comment>
