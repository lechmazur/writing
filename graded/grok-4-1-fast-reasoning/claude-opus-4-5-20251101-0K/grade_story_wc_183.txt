<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sister's arrival and reluctance create relationship crucible forcing Maya's weaving choice; internal conflict in shifting memories embodied concretely. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("Maya understood then") slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: memory fragments densify to sister confrontation; closure RR (hand solidifies) with conceptual cost of rejecting erasure legible in "fog has been my home." Orientation anchored early in ship/mirrors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carousel horses and emerald dress constrain choices (Maya rides for phantom motion, card as talisman); foggy bay evolves causally as fog thins at closure, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim sister/memory) tightens via sister reluctance ("trying to forget"), forcing narrative agency; cost felt in flickering form and risk of permanent loss, under accumulative cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs erasure emerges organically; final image (card falls, matching world) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting Garden as "erasure dressed in green."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (warped mirrors splitting self); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Let us remember together"), distinguishing voices via echo/water effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in peak (sister flicker to solidity); minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("pleading hands") risks coherence but pattern-taught and purposeful, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garden as erasure on carnival ship transforms lost-sibling trope via memory unreliability; fresh synthesis in narrative-weaving resolution feels inevitable from prior fragments.</comment>
