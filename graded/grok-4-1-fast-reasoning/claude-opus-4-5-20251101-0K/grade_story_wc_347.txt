<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker motivation rooted in dreams and backstory anchors present choices effectively; endurance of burden earned with felt cost in final acceptance. Internal conflict leans summarized rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, like precise steps amid reluctance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: nut marks cause birds to shift and travelers to follow, culminating in DC/RR closure with legible cost of accepted role as birds sing true song. Orientation anchored immediately in cliffside descent; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth and birds constrain choices (marking paths despite dives); frost evolution affects tactics. Sensory details (copper warnings, brass beaks) filtered through Maren's orchard-honed precision charge final safe emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) signaled early; causal tightening as marks stir birds narrows options with agency. Cost visible in ice forming and dive risk, charging poise at safe valley overlook.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of burdens choosing bearers emerges organically from cursed grove ties to labyrinth rescue; final image of graceless valley and birds' song offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (instinctive precision, orchard bias); sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Follow it upward"). Rhythmic control modulates tension without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel through descent to rescue; no loops or scaffolds. Final line's "one glowing mark at a time" recharges nut motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed nuts reactivating guardian birds transforms tropes organically; risk in connecting orchard-cliff logic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at birds' song.</comment>
