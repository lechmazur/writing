<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between ethical diligence and guilt act in carving decision during pendulum pause; embodied via step-counting ritual and loupe inspection, earning acknowledgment without self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ritual density tightening to carving in pendulum pause as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in "first small weight lifted," reconfiguring isolation into shared guilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian grooves constrain weathered climb and pendulum bob charges carving image; tide pool mirrors reflect guilt, filtering through watchmaker's precision to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Guilt stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via rake discovery to carving renunciation of solitude; agency forecloses isolation path with felt lighter burden on descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Carving "Maren Voss. Seventeenth of October. Seventeen seconds. Four souls" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting guilt as communal incremental process without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature fixates on time mechanisms like pendulum arc and step counts; rhythmic control modulates from ascent tension to descending poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High-density propulsion with varied syntax peaks at "time itself seemed to hold its breath" carving; zero loops or scaffolds preserve closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rake handle as shared confessional liturgy transforms guilt trope into communal incremental absolution; inevitable from precision ritual, risking lyric density payoff.</comment>
