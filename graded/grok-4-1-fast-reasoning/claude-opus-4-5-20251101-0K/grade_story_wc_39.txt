<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to decode the box roots consistently in his poet-vagrant traits, culminating in an earned reconfiguration of purpose with embodied cost ("ache of beauty too large for his chest"). Interiority particular via sound-gathering and jar uncorking; minor abstract summary in epiphany dilutes contradiction in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of gathered sounds builds to RR closure (Charged Poise in final whisper and indelible stories vs. erased footprints) with conceptual cost legible in "stories that nothing could wash away." Orientation anchored by para 1; single tightening via emergent "Samuel" story pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt/kelp smells, sand cascade, jar sounds) filters through Marcus's priorities, constraining choices (loft as sound-trap) and charging closure image (dunes/sun painting loft). Recurring jars/box evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/translate) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mingled sounds yielding "Samuel," narrowing to purpose endurance with felt cost (lonesome exile sweetened but aching). Agency in patient gathering; no live antagonist but internal want/need friction coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connecting discarded sounds/stories emerges implicitly from particulars (jars, box, "grief made small enough to carry"), reweighting premise in final image (footprints erased, stories enduring) without moralizing. Resonance from Marcus's arc inextricable from gleaned redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (sound-obsessed noticing: "thin cry of wind," jar releases); lyrical rhythm modulates wistfully to charged closure without elision or drift. Prose texture (syntax echoing poet mind) heightens pressure in dawn emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (read-aloud flows: short punches in "sand cascading," long swells in loft description); purposeful figuratives ("patient architecture of storms") integrate without muddle in peak realization. Minor paraphrase in reflection beats ("purpose," "calling") avoids loops but caps perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sound-jar alchemy decoding maritime grief transforms vagrant trope into fresh translator calling; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off inevitably at "whispered the name Samuel," heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
