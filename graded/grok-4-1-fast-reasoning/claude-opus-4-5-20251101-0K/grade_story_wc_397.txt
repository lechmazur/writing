<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied stroke effects ("colors bleeding at their edges, time moving in stutters") and micro-choices like joining volunteers reveal contradictory impulses toward Zurich vs. new purpose; earned endurance in uncertain calendar. Captain Elise's wisdom applies targeted pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("loosened hold on reality") borders therapy-speak but ties to actions without flattening flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to stroke-rewritten purpose to Charged Poise closure ("suspended in the vast space between intentions"). Orientation anchored early (Svalbard marina). One tightening via volunteering fold forecloses suicide path with felt cost in abstract future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains trawling and charges final image ("marina groaned again, and she leaned into its song"); sensory hierarchy (groans, fogged breath, blue ice cathedrals) filtered through Maren's post-stroke perception. Ice sounds evolve, mirroring internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (euthanasia vs. Arctic purpose) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through stroke and volunteering discovery; agency in joining dinghy narrows options. Cost legible in Zurich uncertainty charging poise, but slightly abstract viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile survival/patience emerges organically from parasol, ice shifts, stroke; final image ("waiting itself had become a kind of living") offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration reweighting initial intent without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("world had shifted sideways"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation under reflection (e.g., "fold between certainty and surrender"). Elise's dialogue natural, subtextual ("You see between things now").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful metaphors (ice "cathedral," "breath fogging") taught early without muddle. Ice groan motif patterned, not looped; final line recharges cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourist stroke-altered by Arctic volunteering/parasol survival; bold lyric risk in reflective accumulative drive heightens quiet closure stakes organically.</comment>
