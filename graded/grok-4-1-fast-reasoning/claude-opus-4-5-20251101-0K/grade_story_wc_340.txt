<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in mother's diary and service history compels the release action with earned change; warmly inquisitive trait shown through past inquiries enabling insight. Interiority concrete via embodied goggles warmth and steady heartbeat under cold. Minor slip: internal conflict more reflective summary than simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal ascent beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelation density tightening per floor toward RR/Charged Poise closure: jar lifted scatters light, reconfiguring grief with emotional cost legible in Vesper's gasp and tears. Orientation anchored immediately in elevator/spire; single continuous scene with causal floor linkages narrowing to decisive release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator constrain timing/ascension, with prismatic ice walls charging final light-scatter image; sensory details (groaning gears, frosted windows, seeping cold) filtered through Mira's priorities, evolving causally to observatory jars. Micro-setting of goggles-as-prism ties body/tool to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release preserved joy beneath grief) signaled early via diary, tightens accumulatively through floor-deepened knowledge forcing stance crystallization in jar-lift agency; cost felt in ending reconfiguration of Vesper's detachment. One meaningful cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of joy under grief's "heavier coat" emerges organically from diary quotes, service reflections, and final luminous scatter without statement; resonant non-literal answer in light touching Vesper's face reweights prior anguish particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light-scattered rainbows and prism views; rhythmic prose modulates from steady ascent to soft closure dialogue. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("these memories are ready to come home") advances release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., floor passes weave action/revelation); varied rhythm accelerates via short diary quotes, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative consistency in light/ice/prisms without muddle in peak release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Goggles' decryption via scattered light offers fresh synthesis of inheritance, service, and frozen preservation; risk in ascendant structure heightens inevitability without gimmick, transforming grief-trope through spire specificity.</comment>
