<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as "forgiving skeptic" act simultaneously in the digging beat, with embodied doubt yielding to earned commitment; final renunciation of skepticism carries visible cost in years of ache, fully satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as evidence density (tooth to bones) culminates in Conceptual Repricing at "She would not rebury these bones," with legible conceptual cost in realigned worldview; orientation anchored by maze emergence in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hollow femur held to moonlight constrains examination and charges final image; garden's jasmine/honey and maze evolution filter through doctor's priorities, satisfying 9+ gate without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving doubt tightens via bone discovery narrowing skeptic options, driven by agency in digging; cost unmistakably felt in "all the years she had refused to listen," charging pursuit under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of box with fragment offers resonant non-literal answer to certainty's cleft, reweighting grief-to-scholarship without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars like opalescent tooth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with doctor's perceptual signature ("puzzles of calcium and cartilage") modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via lines like "shrewdly innocent in her trespass"; zero loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, passing 9+ test cleanly through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore through doctor's "bone setting" for beliefs transforms trope organically; risk in excavating grief heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at maze closure.</comment>
