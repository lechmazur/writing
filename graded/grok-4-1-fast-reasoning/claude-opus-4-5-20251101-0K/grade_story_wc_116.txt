<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority particular through observations like "silence was not absence but accumulation," revealing motivation to witness without judgment; endurance in final breathing earned via prior loosening. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal witnessing moments, leaning declarative. Strong single-POV coherence sustains under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from discoveries to methods, culminating in CR closure: "catacombs breathed around her, and she breathed back" reconfigures witnessing with conceptual cost of dissolution into silence. Orientation anchored early in catacombs; continuous shards with legible wandering transitions. No ambiguity or causality breaks; persistent constraint of crumbling shapes final poise.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory details like "roots threaded through collapsed shelves and moss softened the spines" filter through keeper's priorities, constraining burrowing and charging final breathing image. Micro-setting (river, refuge) guides choices and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent in passages; environment evolves causally with decay.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake to witness without judgment signaled early, tightens accumulatively via swan folds' methods and loosening grip, narrowing to endurance with felt cost in "become part of the accumulated silence." Pressure coheres under textural lens; one deepening (refuge discovery) reweights options. No abstract stakes; micro-costs like crumbling shelves alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Regenerative silence emerges organically from decay/growth images, reweighted in final breathing without moralizing; invites ambiguity on judgment's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme via witnessing choices. Resonant non-literal answer in "world changed without knowing it was being remembered" charges prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: selective noticing of "dripped constellations of moisture" reflects philosophical bias. Rhythmic control modulates from burrowing propulsion to charged poise; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density with lines like "books became soil became roots became new words" advancing texture and theme; rhythm varies naturally, read-aloud ear strong. Minor purposeful repetition ("loosely," "crumbling") fits accumulative mode without loops obscuring closure; no filter stacks or scaffold in peak beats. Figuratives consistent, no muddle.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of decay-as-regeneration via origami folds as geometric prayers transforms tropes; origami swan's evolving role feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk in textural witnessing heightens stakes without gimmickry; conceptual integrity in crumbling catacombs commits fully. No derivative echoes; particular details anchor originality.</comment>
