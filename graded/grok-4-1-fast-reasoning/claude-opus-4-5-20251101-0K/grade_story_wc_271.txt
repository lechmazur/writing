<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak embodied in hawk-triggered freeze versus grounding hand on soil, earning final endurance with visible bodily cost; no unearned epiphanies or label-speak dilute closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of trauma cues building to Charged Poise closure in seedlings as "small vote for the future"; hawk beat tightens with legible cost of receding panic, orientation anchored by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum's salt soil and netting constrain panic response (hand flat against earth) and charge final greenhouse image; selective sensory hierarchy (fog, hawk, foam) mirrors POV survival bias without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring realism amid trauma tightens via hawk reversal, forcing somatic agency that forecloses freeze with felt shoulder ache and persistent sky threat charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl of stillness emerges organically from Fatima's photo to seedlings image, reweighting "world could grow gentler... might not" with non-literal resonance and countervailing truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with somatic/plant perceptual signature modulates rhythm under hawk stress; purposeful compression in ritual beats teaches pattern paid off at closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to ending without loops (somatic naming pattern-taught purposeful); minor clinical edge to "somatic markers" in peak hawk beat contained, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone survivor as "quietly talented" botanist transforms trauma tropes via orchid parallels and lighthouse ghost; risk in lyric accrual heightens stakes organically.</comment>
