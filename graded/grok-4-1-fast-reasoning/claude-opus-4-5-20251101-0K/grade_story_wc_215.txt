<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in grandmother's ghost compels endurance as keeper, with contradictory impulses in preserving vs. potential release visible in "Perhaps Maren would find her. Perhaps she would open the box." Internal conflict embodied in holding box to chest; flaws like solitude compound without tidy resolution. Earned stasis forecloses easy release with patience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to Charged Poise/CR in final image of listening to silence, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of patience ("The tangled covenant demanded patience"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via ghost's interaction narrows to preservation stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stained glass box as micro-setting constrains choices (opened for ghosts) and charges final image (bees of gold on walls). Wasteland/oasis sensory details selective via Maren's calm POV, mirroring internal tranquility; evolves with ghost arrivals without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve silences) signaled early, deepens accumulatively with mother ghost's gestures forcing micro-choice to seal words. Cost legible in burden ("another stone in the cairn") and "not yet" renunciation; pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence's weight emerges from box interactions and ghost gestures, resonant CR in "the silence told her everything" reweighting unspoken as eloquent without moral state. Subtext in ghost peace vs. living child's wonder invites ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (reading gestures "as others once read books"); rhythmic diction modulates from descriptive calm to charged end. No head-hopping or elision; voice reflects Maren's tranquilly perceptive mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stained glass box, its panels depicting bees... scattering... across her weathered hands"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (bees/cairn/silences). Propulsion aligns with accumulative texture to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible ghosts and silence preservation via interpretive box transforms spectral trope into covenant of muteness. Risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes; final CR feels inevitable from oasis/box particulars.</comment>
