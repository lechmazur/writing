<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses to mend vs. unravel act in scene through needle work; final hand-steadying renunciation of perfect restoration earned by guilt-trade causality. Embodied emotion in trembling-to-steady hands reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: confession density tightens to her realization (DC/RR), reconfiguring silence economy with felt cost in "trading silences." Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/net; closure image of needle in dawn seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains via refracting confessions/answers, charging final release into daylight; selective sensory (starlight fractures, cold pressure) mirrors internal hush. Micro-setting (net knots, needle) guides unraveling choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits/own guilt) signaled early, accumulates via knot-releases narrowing to personal admission; agency in sustained unraveling forecloses failed-restoration path with hand-cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trading silences theme emerges organically from net confessions to kintsugi-masks image, reweighting restoration premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer in "leave the cracks visible, stitch gold."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in hush/fracture diction; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via Callum's curiosity pressuring Mira's pause.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varying rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful lyrical figures consistent without muddle in peak unraveling. Opening anchors stakes, final needle-ray resolves image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-secrets economy and kintsugi-mirrored restoration transforms tropes; risk-taking in textural hush accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
