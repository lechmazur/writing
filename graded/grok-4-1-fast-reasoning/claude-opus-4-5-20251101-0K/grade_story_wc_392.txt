<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like methodical photography amid fear; motivation to expose smuggling earned through prior discoveries and renunciation of Harrison's control. Minor therapy-speak slip ("associative recall") diagnostic without full embodiment deducts from peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: notes lead to lantern discovery therefore to smuggling evidence therefore to decision; Charged Poise closure in ladder climb and plan to report, with legible cost in "whatever consequences awaited." Orientation anchored early; single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp walls, vibrations through bones, lantern's ventilation holes) constrain exploration and charge final beam on lantern. Tunnel as micro-setting guides choices, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; rain bookends payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth, break from Harrison) signaled early, tightens causally through discoveries narrowing options to exposure; agency in precise documentation forecloses silence path with felt cost of retaliation. One deepening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of courage amid vulnerability emerges organically from tunnel histories and rain/drought metaphor, resonating in final emergence without moralizing; mother's quote integrates as cue tilting present stance. Lantern reprise reweights freedom/truth without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: empirical, body-grounded noticing (bones vibrating); rhythmic prose modulates tension precisely. No dialogue; elision of backstory anchors to present cues without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, strong verbs propel through discoveries; minor repetition of "empirical observation" fits voice without looping. No artifacts dull closure; final image clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad tunnel as smuggling route transforms tropes via investigator's empirical lens; risk in historical/personal convergence inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
