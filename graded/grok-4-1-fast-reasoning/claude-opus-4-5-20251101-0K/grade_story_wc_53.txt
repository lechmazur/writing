<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—survival pragmatism versus ambition—act simultaneously in negotiations, embodied in the cold ghost proximity and spray only wetting her; final renunciation earned by collected stories, foreclosing denial with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, negotiation density tightens via overheard regret fragment, yielding Resonant Reconfiguration when ghost dissolves after "I regret... pretended the stopping was a choice," with conceptual cost of admitted fear legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon's churning luminosity and selective spray (ghost unwet) constrain scavenging and negotiations; charges closure as ghost joins "fragments caught in perpetual motion," mirroring Mira's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ghost reconciliation accumulates pressure through failed talks, deepened by overheard story enabling agency in regret admission; cost unmistakable in foreclosed pretense, reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eroded ambition theme emerges from debris collection paralleling self-assembly, resonantly answered non-literally in "even broken wheels turn" and churning lagoon image reweighting stasis into potential motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with time-slippery perceptual signature; dialogue subtext advances negotiation goals distinctly—Mira practical, ghost accusatory—tightening rhythmically in climax exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High-density propulsion with varied rhythm and integrated images like "ambitions erode like everything else up here"; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures, even in peak admission beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal fusion of halted carousel world and self-ghost negotiation transforms ambition erosion trope organically; risk of blurred time heightens stakes, inevitable in lagoon-charged closure.</comment>
