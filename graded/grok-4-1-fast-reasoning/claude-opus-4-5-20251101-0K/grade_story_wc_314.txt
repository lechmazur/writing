<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—precision vs. hidden sentimentality—act simultaneously in the crystal-flame beat, earning the wholeness at closure; no unearned epiphanies, embodied ache against sternum ties to mother's gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to starling descent to transformation RR (empty chain as felt cost, "She had become the bridge"); orientation anchored in opening paragraph, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's chiming leaves and spiraling blossoms constrain ritual (kneeling under oldest tree) and charge final image (ancient freshness carried forward); sensory hierarchy reflects alchemist's priorities, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition or become nothing) signaled early, tightens via starling signal and flame-action agency; cost legible in crystal's transformation, but abstract risk lacks one visceral on-page complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (equations interlacing intuitions); final image non-literally answers "Logic builds the vessel. Intuition fills it with light," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical lyricism: "breathing poem"); rhythmic control modulates from patient circular time to sunrise-through-water intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure (e.g., short spirals of blossoms build cadence); no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (prismatic mist to wonder-touch).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual via starling geometries and dew-crystal fuses familiar wonder tropes into inevitable transformation; risk in sentimental core heightens stakes organically.</comment>
