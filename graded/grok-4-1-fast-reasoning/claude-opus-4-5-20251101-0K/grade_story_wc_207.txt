<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing compass between palms; embodied emotions (breath caught, sternum pull) reveal particular traits without labels. Minor slip: no clear contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the vision beat, but earned change at awakening forecloses return path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from descent to spinning compass; orientation anchored early (descent after factory). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final image ("no longer looking for the way back") with conceptual cost of belonging to mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (bioluminescent spirals, petrichor scent) filter through Maren's priorities, constraining silence for collection. Lagoon's evolving patterns charge final "welcome," mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Threshold) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to vision and patterns narrowing rational frame. Agency in psychometry and jar ritual forces stance crystallization; cost legible in compass spin reconfiguring direction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of explanations failing emerges organically from particulars like Vennard vision and petrichor keys; final image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring mystery images reweight premise with ambiguity embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (mineral air, pulsing letters); rhythmic control heightens pressure in vision shift. No dialogue; purposeful compression in awakening moment pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and strong verbs; minor overwriting in metaphors ("cathedral columns, impossible lace") adds texture without muddling peak vision. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion aligns with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, petrichor harvesting, and Threshold transforms mystic tropes; compass reprise feels inevitable. Bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
