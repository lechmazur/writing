<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in fractal entrapment drives all micro-choices like orienting the loom; embodied interiority shines in "fractals...spread into her thoughts"; earned change to "edges she could finally feel" shows endurance with cost of absorbed sorrows, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as burden-weaving densifies pattern toward RR closure; on-page cost legible in "calcifying...into structure" and merged weaving; single scene oriented early ("bronze grotto after the first snowmelt"), no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bronze walls' "mineral sweat" and "shingled hush" constrain choices by directing loom orientation; starlight aperture charges final dawn shift; sensory hierarchy (acoustic echoes over visual) mirrors POV urgency, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor fractals or mind calcifies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered burdens narrowing infinite propagation; agency in weaving forces trade-off, cost felt in "heavy, grounded" fractal and self-structuring; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-structure emerges organically from burden-weaving and name recovery; final image ("Elara" whispered, fractals bounded) resonantly reweights premise without moralizing; recurring patterns shift from trap to anchor, embracing ambiguity of persistent fractals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with fractal-perceptual signature ("patterns that never quite resolved"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to dawn lightness; purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid in closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shingled hush" advances setting/stakes/voice); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language pattern-taught in fractal motifs, coherent without muddle even in peak weaving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal gift as curse/need, burden-collection via resonant grotto, and name-restoration transforms tropes; risk in abstract-cum-tactile (echo-weaving) heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early motifs to "lightness of being found."</comment>
