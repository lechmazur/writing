<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots clearly in grandmother's gift and her budding status, driving micro-choices like deliberate key-turning under pressure; interiority embodies growth via marked hands and deepening understanding. Contradictory impulses surface in her inexperience vs. stepping up, earning her final readiness with felt cost of relearning isolation. Secondary pressure from automaton corrects her precisely, revealing flaws without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: spoon-bending → rune shifts → key insertion awakens automaton → explanation reveals cracks → guided rune-tracing seals them, closing with Charged Poise as shadows return and Mira reconfigures from learner to sentinel. Orientation anchors early (Mira, observatory, post-bending). Closure cost legible in "precision...requires a scholar" line, her novice hands paying via corrected angles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating isle and brass observatory constrain choices—runes hidden under telescope base, dome reveals inter-star voids—charging final image of shadows journeying home amid false dawn. Sensory details (creaking dome, whispering gears, glowing clouds) filter through Mira's rune-biased perception, mirroring internal relearning. Micro-setting (key slot, rising automaton) evolves causally, tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return noon-shadows) signals early, tightens causally via automaton's revelation narrowing to timed sealing; her agency in tracing modified runes forecloses failure path with inexperience cost. Escalation driven by her novice errors corrected on-page, pressure coheres to Charged Poise. One reversal (shadows visible, requiring new runes) suffices, visible prices (weeks practicing, heart racing) alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of closing/reopening loops emerges organically from bent runes, fleeing shadows, and Mira's relearning arc, reweighting premise in final "some loops...meant to begin" without moralizing. Returning images (runes, key) shift meaning, charging closure with conceptual cost of shifted reality. Subtext in shadows' humanoid outlines invites ambiguity on light's hostility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Mira, perceptual signature in rune-tracing bias and deliberate calm; voice modulates rhythmically from quiet ascent to precise awakening. Automaton dialogue distinct (chimes, ancient tone) pursues exposition-as-action with subtext on shadows' flight. No head-hopping, diction fits budding scholar without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short gears-whisper to unfolding limbs); rhythm breathes with scene (slow key-turn to dawn touch). Minor paraphrase loops ("relearning" thrice, "quietly deliberate" reprise) deduct lightly, not obscuring closure image. No artifacts in peak (rune-tracing), vivid verbs (curling spoons, kindled eyes) over modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bent reality (spoons curl, shadows flee noon) transforms portal fantasy via rune-loops and relearned scholar, inevitable in hindsight from key gift. Risky quiet escalation via dialogue-revelation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, bold premise commits fully.</comment>
