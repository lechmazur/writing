<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—defying surgery while embracing her "aberration"—act in scene through micro-choices like pocketing the hourglass, earning the brother's alignment; Thomas applies crucible pressure without stereotypes. Final endurance of her gift forecloses normalcy with felt cost. Minor reflection on mother's scars tilts present without excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant whispers and coffee-ring message accumulate to Charged Poise closure as sand falls, reweighting miracle premise with cost of pursuit over cure. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tower, post-surgery dawn). Single scene tightens via brother's choice; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting constrains via garden passage and plant senses mirroring urgency; fern/ivy/moss filter Mira's bias, evolving with dawn light and frost. Final descent charges image. Sensory selection (whispers, vibrations) purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find mother's last patient before doctors) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via persistent telepathy and brother's grief-forced stance crystallization; plant urgency narrows options. Protagonist agency in reading rings guides escalation; cost legible in "tunnel out" defiance, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars as stories emerges from rings, mother's work, Mira's brain "wound"; final sand fall reconfigures aberration-as-miracle without moralizing, resonating via particulars. Subtext in brother's seeing "nothing but stains" creates irony. No tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (plant-hearing bias); dialogue natural/subtextual ("chasing ghosts") distinguishes voices under stress. Rhythm modulates to hushed dawn poise; no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via image integration ("sand... frozen in its descent"); rhythm varies for dawn hush, no loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor density ("bled across the horizon") purposeful for tone, not muddling closure sand image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, scar-reading, frozen miracle transforms tropes organically; coffee rings as fortune map risks bold ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via mother's legacy payoff. No derivatives.</comment>
