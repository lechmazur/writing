<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in guilt-driven decoding; contradictory impulses peak in mirror reflection where realization confronts self-forgiveness. Final dropping of knight earned by prior micro-choices with embodied cost ("something unknotted"). No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through thread-decoding to pattern break at mirror, cadence shifts with time resuming as CR closure. On-page cost legible in knight drop rippling "like water, carrying... weight." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (frozen village, labyrinth) constrains decoding choice and charges final image; recurring knight/tool embodies guilt. Sensory hush/thunder selective via POV, mirroring internal stasis. Platinum paths and frayed threads tactile, lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at mirror ("taught chess, not murder") narrowing options to renunciation. Protagonist agency in tracing/decoding forces trade-off; cost felt in piece drop foreclosing endless wandering. Tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (guilt's labyrinth dissolved by stasis) emerges implicitly via decoding and knight drop; final image ("hands finally still") reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in irreversible past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (thread/path decoder); rhythmic modulation heightens hush to repose. Compression purposeful, taught early; no elision or head-hopping. Prose texture character-specific, biased to geometry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak (mirror/knight drop clean). Concrete images replace generics; sentence propulsion matches emotional cadence. Zero artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess guilt + frozen hush + thread-labyrinth transforms time-trope into penance site. Risky CR closure ("look up") inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
