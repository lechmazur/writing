<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation to rebuild hearing through plants is rooted in trauma and intensifies via embodied persistence (fingers cramp), culminating in earned reconfiguration when her own hummed vibration maps in gold. Interiority concrete via thermal focus over abstract diagnosis. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("auditory cortex") doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated strikes build density to self-mapping climax as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting silence with cost of traditional recovery foreclosed ("music wouldn't sound the way she remembered"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory's crystalline walls and frozen specimens constrain via thermal/vibrational responses, charging closure when her chest warms in gold against the darkening glass. Sensory hierarchy (thermal over auditory) POV-specific. Details woven into action, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from orchid patterns to self-humming with felt cost of irrecoverable sound. Agency in endurance/renunciation tightens options. One deepening (personal mapping) coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence as new expressive language emerges organically from plant "symphonies" and her gold-mapped emotion, offering non-literal resonance without moralizing. Final image reweights premise via particulars. Ambiguity in "stubborn refusal" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in thermal/silent noticing; rhythmic modulation builds from precise setup to lyrical close ("translating the impossible into something she could finally hold"). No elision or head-hopping; diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language (ice motifs) pattern-taught early without muddle in peak (humming beat clean). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion aligns with accumulative build to glowing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes trauma, synesthesia via plants, and thermal music—fresh angle transforms disability trope. Risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at self-mapping turn, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
