<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between perfection and imperfection act in her alchemy choices; final embedding of coin earns change with cost of carrying legacy openly. Interiority concrete via "hands steady despite the trembling in her heart." No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from setup to CR closure in crucible reveal, reweighting redemption with cost in "weight of his name shifted... no longer purely leaden." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry constrains via furnace/workbench, charges closure with "old iron beams into something luminous"; sensory hierarchy (rain percussion to fire shadows) reflects alchemical focus. Recurring rain evolves causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption) tightens accumulatively through process cadence to CR; agency in impure mixing forecloses purification path with cost in honored imperfections. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from kintsugi particulars, resonant CR in metal's "imperfect sheen" reweights perfection premise without moral; ambiguity in sacrifice lingers honestly. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (alchemical noticing: "light like captured tears"); rhythmic control modulates from rain's "patient percussion" to dawn's charge. No head-hopping; elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short peak sentences in crucible open); metaphors coherent/purposeful, no loops or drift. Minor figurative density in process beats doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh kintsugi-alchemy synthesis transforms redemption trope; risk in "factually mystical" philosophy heightens stakes organically. Final coin embedding inevitable from particulars.</comment>
