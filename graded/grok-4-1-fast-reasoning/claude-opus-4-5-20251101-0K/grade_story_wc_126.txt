<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied knot unbinding during second play; contradictory impulses (fight hush vs. listen between) act simultaneously, earning final endurance of imperfect music with visible cost to prior style.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failed play accumulates to adaptive listening/playing between silences, landing Charged Poise closure where hush reconfigures from suffocation ("pulled notes down") to "space between notes" with emotional cost legible in unbinding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain via tide rising to floor and acoustic hush absorbing sound; final image of bowl glowing amid listening wrecks/trees charges closure, sensory hierarchy acoustic-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (play amid hush) signaled early tightens via adaptive play that forecloses old forceful style; agency in listening narrows options with cost to music's former richness, though single deepening keeps under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from interrupted stories, unripe fruit, hesitant notes; final "silence... space between notes" offers resonant CR reweighting hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with acoustic perceptual signature (hears "absence," water "almost" music); rhythmic control modulates from hesitant to patient prose mirroring stakes, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short frustrated sentences to flowing adaptive ones); zero loops, metaphors cohere (hush as "held breath"), propulsion peaks in unbinding without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn "chronic hush" and acoustic perception transforms silence trope; risk in lyric adaptation of music pays off in inevitable-feeling closure without gimmickry.</comment>
