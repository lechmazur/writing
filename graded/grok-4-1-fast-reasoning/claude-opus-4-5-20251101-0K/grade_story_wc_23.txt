<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular via patchwork charts and trembling grip on censer; contradictory endurance (stays despite evacuation) compels building with raw-hand cost. Final choice earned by call's clarity and family anchors. No diagnostic speak; flaws deepen stakes without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of calls and moon phases builds to CR in final call/image of gathering lights, reweighting grief with conceptual cost (absence to presence). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; closure charged poise legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Censer and shattered lenses constrain building choices and charge final array test; sensory hierarchy (starlight, churning sea) mirrors navigator bias. Micro-setting (workstation mirrors) evolves with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide lost home) signaled early, tightens via moon-clarity call forcing array build; agency in positioning mirrors forecloses mechanical repair with raw-hand cost. Accumulative deepening reweights options without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-path emerges via particulars (coordinates, censer return); final image/voice recognition offers non-literal answer, reweighting Departure without moral. Resonance from salvage beacon, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited perceptual signature (navigation via stars/sea whispers); rhythmic modulation peaks in "starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams." No elision issues; diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense propulsion, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("groaning like wounded") purposeful in opening, clears pressure beats; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Soul-beacon from hydraulics/salvage transforms Departure trope; reverse migration synthesis inevitable via calls/array. Risky future-self voice heightens conceptual cost without gimmick.</comment>
