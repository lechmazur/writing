<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior conflict embodied in shard-tracing and fear of becoming mother culminates in earned whisper ("Mama"), foreclosing silence with emotional cost; contradictory impulses act in visions of accident; no therapy-speak undermines peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of song/images builds to CR closure in shard visions and "I knew, little moon," reweighting silence with relational cost; orientation anchored early in boat/mangroves; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangroves/roots constrain movement (platform step, oars), moonlight/condensation charge final image; sensory hierarchy (song in chest, warm shard) mirrors emotional thaw; recurring shard as micro-setting evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via spirit/words/shard to agency in whisper; cost unmistakable in "twenty years of silence crack"; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forgiveness emerges from shard's shifting visions, non-literal answer in mother's words reweighting blame; ambiguity lingers in flaws' shaping without tidy moral; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias (medium's reflections) distinct; spirit's song indirection advances; rhythm modulates to crescendo at "silence crack like ice in spring thaw."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (fog over water, silver threading); varied rhythm propels to charged final image; zero scaffold in peak shard beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove spirits/shard for forgiveness transforms ghost-story tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes; inevitable hindsight from early "unsent letters."</comment>
