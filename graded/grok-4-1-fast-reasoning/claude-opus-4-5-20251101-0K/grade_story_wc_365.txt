<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's sensory mapping drives concrete micro-choices under pressure, like touching the floor to confirm her mother's gait, earning the final purposeful charting. Interiority particular via neural interface imprints; embodied emotions in shard warming and surge cresting. Minor slip: reflective summaries slightly abstract motivation early, but anchor present actions without flattening drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory layers build to vision shard, tightening via surge to CR closure where truth reconfigures inheritance with cost ("weight... settle into her bones"). Orientation anchored by para 1 (Mira in bay). One deepening suffices; vision pays off thin-reality setup without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bay's derelict details (drones, lipstick cups) selectively constrain: unit as rift thread enables surge. Mirrors internal via "cathedral to obsolescence"; spatial choreography clear across shards. 9+ gate met: setting charges final rift step.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maternal truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shard pulse and surge vision narrowing to toxicity revelation. Agency in riding surge forecloses abandonment illusion with inheritance cost. Visible price in accumulated exposure alters tactics to protected charting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial truth-as-anchor emerges via shard filter realization, resonating in final image without statement. Particulars (gait pattern, officer argument) build complexity; ending reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature ("texture... seep into fingertips"). Voice texture modulates rhythmically; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("crystals reveal the rifts"). No head-hopping; elision in vision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short surge sentences). Figuratives purposeful ("reality thin as membrane") but sparse in peak vision. Minor paraphrase in bay descriptions (-0.3), no loops or artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory neural mapping + dimensional toxicity filter transforms multiverse trope organically. Risk in lyrical shards heightens stakes; final anchor-flight image inevitable from particulars.</comment>
