<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in trembling fingers at uncasing, embodying oath vs. necessity; flaw of "madness" compounds to earned insight shift from grief to armed potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via flute vision to CR closure ("insight burned..."); driftwood constraint shapes return with disobedience cost legible in "sworn never to uncase."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hollow's "avalanchingly quiet" constrains perception during flute play; copper-tasting path and River driftwood enable marker choice, charging final silence as "potential."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens in vision's "dark thread" flaw, narrowing to discordant readiness; agency in playing despite oath forecloses harmony path with "terrible act" cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed by solo keeper's counterpoint insight and inter-reality driftwood safety net; fresh inevitability in silence reframed as "potential."</comment>
