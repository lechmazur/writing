<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied analysis of emotions as "data points," driving sacrificial choice; "logically emotional" trait enables hum despite pain but edges label-speak without deeper contradiction in peak sync moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: news of vessel (inciting) → skiff commandeer → key unlock → hum match → tone release (DC closure); cost legible in "body could not sustain... consciousness dispersing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and chapel constrain urgency via scraping hulls, fleeting light, thickening air; recurring coat/key charge final image as "relic without purpose," mirroring dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect via release) tightens causally with vessel lights narrowing time/options; agency in vibrational match forecloses hiding path with self-dissolution cost on climax page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absolution theme emerges via release granting world-wide grief dissolution; final "frequency of absolution, eternal and free" reweights commodification premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters engineer bias (incremental frequency adjustment, adaptation); rhythmic modulation peaks in sync's "unmade and reassembled," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; minor "fleshly ethereal" reprise purposeful for tone, no loops/artifacts dulling closure's "ripples" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic absolution via vibrational self-sacrifice transforms guardian trope organically; dissolution into global hum feels inevitable from family key/Consortium pressure.</comment>
