<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses as affectionate skeptic yield to body-led belief, earning the final gathering of slivers with fragile hope as visible cost; micro-choices like sleepwalker navigation reveal values hierarchy. Interiority embodied via somatic markers avoids labels. Final renunciation of doubt feels inevitable from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density layering from somatic tingles to chamber discovery as CR closure; cost legible in "hope rising...as fragile and luminous as light through willowglass." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene tightens via knee buckle to hidden seam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio micro-setting constrains via wall seam and light wand guiding somatic search; recurring mica and wand charge final name-painting image. Sensory hierarchy (tingling palm to amber glow) reflects urgency. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent through sleepwalker path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to illuminate pathways escalates accumulatively via somatic deepening from shoulder grief to knee-concealment, narrowing to chamber payoff with fragile hope cost. Agency in body-led choices forecloses doubt path. One tightening suffices, reweighting pill as control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of body-truth over mind-lies emerges via mica layers mirroring Daniel's complexity, reweighted in journal as control revelation; final wand-painting offers non-literal answer without moral. Particulars like fractal light avoid abstraction. Resonance from skeptic arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in fractal precision and light metaphors; diction modulates from doubt to luminous resolve. Rhythmic compression heightens somatic beats. No withholding; inference matches Maya's knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "swept the light wand...right knee buckled" advances action, somatic cue, stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent (fractal spirals). Zero loops or scaffolds. Closure image propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Somatic telepathy via shock transforms trope into fresh synthesis of body recall, light-painting, mica breadcrumbs; risk in nonlinear body-guidance pays off at charged poise. Non-obvious moral calculus of control vs. illumination inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
