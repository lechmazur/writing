<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mother's paintings compels theft with felt personal cost; interiority concrete and embodied in breath-catching disbelief at jar's glow. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in theft beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore signals (flowers warn/adjust approach/theft); on-page Decisive Change in jar swap with legible cost (collector's cry, lifelong pursuit foreclosed path). Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald tiles pulsing under moonlight constrain reveal/timing of jar, charge final image as station fades; sensory details (glow seeping seams) selective via POV urgency. Micro-setting (flowers, platforms) guides choices fluidly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate jar) signaled early, causal tightening via flower codes forces adjusted approach narrowing options; agency in brush-past theft with on-page cost (guards implied, dismay cry). No reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared beauty vs. hoarding emerges via theft/particulars, final image (moonbeams pulsing with heartbeat, mother's presence) reconfigures "corrections" non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with light-obsessed perceptual signature modulates rhythm under pressure; single dialogue line natural/subtextual, advances ploy. POV stable, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration (slow pace to fluid theft); high density integrates motif without loops. Minor lyrical overwriting (e.g., "painting their dreams in silver") risks purple but fits tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist thief via moonbeams/portraits transforms hoarding trope; risk in luminous tone heightens redemption stakes organically.</comment>
