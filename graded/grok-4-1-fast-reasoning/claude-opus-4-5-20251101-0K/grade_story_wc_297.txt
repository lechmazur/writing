<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's scarred body and visionary limits drive concrete micro-choices like clutching the clipping; internal anxious elation shows contradictory impulses acting in the trembling voice line, earning her anchor-renunciation at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from convergence cue to scar-overlay density, yielding RR closure in "roots strained... hold the door steady" with anchor cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's roots tangle feet and constrain Mira's agency, evolving causally with topiary weave to charge final dawn-through-door image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dream-intersection access signaled in "purposefully curious about what seeped through"; scar-linking deepens textural pressure, forcing group-circuit with her endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "root-bound... preparation" realization non-literally reweights dream-geography theme, crystallizing shared access via anchors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with visionary perceptual bias in "scars glowing faintly"; rhythmic modulation peaks in economical scar-reading sequence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in "roots erupted... weaving with the ones already tangled" propels without loops; metaphors like "bleed at its edges" cohere texturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scar-cartography synthesizing dream-paths into tangible maze innovates collective unconscious; root-preparation twist risks bold anchor-cost payoff, inevitable from early cues.</comment>
