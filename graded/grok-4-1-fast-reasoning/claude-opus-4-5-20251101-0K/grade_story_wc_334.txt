<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's folklorist curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like tracing constellations and lifting the mushroom, earning the closure renunciation of routine with embodied cost (weeping, stiff knees). Interior contradiction shines in "habits break" realization amid petrified trees. Family curse flaw complicates without hedging, revealed in grandmother's prophetic line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glass patterns to mushroom lift to jar release (DC/RR), with legible cost in "hungry forgetting" line reconfiguring future. Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored by second paragraph. No lens ambiguity; closure image of fading ring charges before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, petrified trees, and shipwreck ring constrain alignment choice and charge final fading ring image. Cracked glass as constellations filters through folklorist POV, mirroring internal cracks. Sensory damp, whistling wind, salt-rust integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early tightens accumulatively via pattern detection to jar unscrewing, narrowing options with emotional cost in wave-like return. Agency in lifting/unscrewing forecloses forgetting path. Moral calculus emerges in protection imperative, felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory burial/recovery emerges from jar fog colors and "gathering memories like mushrooms," reweighting premise without statement. Final image of new patterns answers forgetting's threat obliquely. Complexity in family curse avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with folklorist perceptual signature (constellations as star charts, mushrooms as markers). Voice crisp-nostalgic, rhythm modulates to wave rush at climax. No elision or head-hopping; diction biases toward myth-dismantling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors like "broken constellations" purposeful without muddle in peak jar beat. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; propulsion peaks in "memories returned like a wave." Concision weaves setting into action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore remedy, sunken geometry, and petrified orchard transforms memory-loss trope via glass-mushroom-jar logic. Risky constellation method feels inevitable in hindsight. No template echoes; bold family-curse protection arc heightens stakes organically.</comment>
