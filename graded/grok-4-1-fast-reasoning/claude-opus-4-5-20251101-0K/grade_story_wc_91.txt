<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied releases ("something in her chest unknot") and micro-choices under dispossession pressure; final renunciation of jars earned by prior philanthropy pattern, with visible cost of emptiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via jar-release progression tightening to CR closure ("texture of transformation under her fingertips"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in emptied jars and rising lightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Black sand heat, bioluminescent waves, and volcano hush constrain releases over summit climb and charge final erased footprints; sensory hierarchy reflects Miriam's textured sensitivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasp transformation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through twelve-jar deepening forcing realization/renunciation; cost felt in jar emptiness foreclosing collection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of release-as-transformation emerges organically from jar actions and prophecy reweighting; final dispersing constellation offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward "invisible threads"; rhythmic modulation heightens release beats without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels releases; no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence (e.g., "planets orbiting, like light escaping glass") enhances without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pivotal lightning bugs as soul-pivots synthesize fresh angle on dispossession; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative closure feels inevitable from coincidence orchestration.</comment>
