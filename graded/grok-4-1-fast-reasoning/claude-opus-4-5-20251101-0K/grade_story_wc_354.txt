<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via worry stone dent and nexus pull, revealing contradictory hopeful melancholy; knight sacrifice memory earns exile's motivation without unearned epiphany. Minor label-speak in "beauty in the difficult sacrifice" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensations build density to Charged Poise closure ("She had discovered... beauty woven through it"), with legible cost in endured exile; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus and basalt stone constrain waiting/writing choices and charge final image ("pressed her thumb into the familiar dent"); sensory hierarchy (electromagnetic whisper, warm stone) reflects chess-precise POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew covenant via documentation) signaled early, escalates via field strengthening/pen accelerating under Accumulative lens; one tightening (moon rise/nexus pulse) narrows to stance crystallization with felt exile cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-loss emerges via chess sacrifice parallel and final journal torch image reweighting exile; no moralizing, resonant non-literal answer in "game continued... beautiful in its most difficult moments."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (precise correlations, silence translation); rhythmic modulation heightens nexus pulse, diction controlled without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensation; minor paraphrase loops ("thoughtfully precise" x3, melancholy echoes) dull mid-section slightly, but no closure touch or template cadence; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess philosophy, magnetic esoterica, and covenant renewal feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame transforms exile trope via nexus/stone particulars.</comment>
