<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (questioning axioms yet seeking patterns) compel the realization; motivation rooted in father's legacy intensifies via discoveries. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "lucid contradictions" borders label-speak but stays anchored to concrete cues. Final endurance to live in contradiction feels earned with visible cost of paying debts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from textbook note to seat discovery to CR closure in realization of irreconcilable multitudes. Orientation anchored early (library, rain, inheritance). Cost legible in "She would pay his debts... learn to live inside it," reweighting her path with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (clover scent, greenish light, old paper) reflects math-professor bias toward patterns; mica lantern charges final image, mirroring fragility. Setting subtly guides reflective choices without overt symbolism. Recurrent rain evolves to soften, contrasting internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher contradictions responsibly) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via seat coordinates to library folder. Agency in her project/endurance forecloses dismissal path; cost felt in debt payment and embrace of compulsion-knowledge coexistence. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges organically from notes/symbols, reweighted in realization without moralizing. Final image (candle through mica illuminating/obscuring) offers non-literal resonance. Father's dedication ties arc to theme; avoids tidy binary by embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in chaos, scents as melancholy). Prose rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged introspection; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice specificity in math-tinged observations like "mathematics of chance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts—sentences multi-job (advance insight + atmosphere). Propulsion peaks cleanly in realization without overwriting. Final line's image recharges lantern motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gambling/probability via subway scrawls transforms trope into poignant CR. Ingenious GPS in father's hand on seat 14 drives turns organically. Risky reflective mode heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
