<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ezra's inadvertent stubbornness with broken things compels the inciting refusal to discard the lens and sustains library burials; contradictory impulses between sensibility and purpose act in scene, earning final stasis with deepened weariness as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via pulsing fragments to coordinates to fusing burials, delivering RR closure in lens blaze and ascent; cost legible in "his weariness deepened... but so did his sense of purpose," reconfiguring endless exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater library's coral spires and impossible shelves constrain soul-finding, mirroring grief geometry; lens fragments recur to charge shelf placement, with bioluminescent fish filtering through Ezra's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring unburied souls tightens accumulatively as each rite fuses a fragment, narrowing drift to rest; Ezra's agency in naming bears visible cost of weariness, charging poise at surfacing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of burying brokenness for kept stillness emerges via lens-soul parallel, answered non-literally in final shelf image and "chased silence catch[ing] him"; reweights refusal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature on silence and fragments; rhythmic diction like "geometry bent like grief" modulates pressure to charged resolution without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image in lines like "each funeral rite fusing another fragment"; varied rhythm propels without loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak library work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker mending drowned library via reforming lens transforms burial tropes; risky surreal spaces heighten stakes organically, inevitable at "library slept in peace."</comment>
