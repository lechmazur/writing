<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via ripple-marks tingling against walls, embodying conflict between body knowledge and changed reality; final mapping choice earned through obsolete maps' cost, revealing values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: vibration details and ice cracks build to stone-whisper test as RR/Charged Poise closure, cost legible in "earned exhaustion"; orientation anchored by para 1, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen waves and ice spirals constrain choices (spiral draft leads to chamber), charging final image where walls whisper via touch; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (quiet amid beings' song) signaled para 1, textural tightening via stone's silent absorption narrowing options to mapping; cost felt in "hammered repose" without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of claiming silence in storm emerges via particulars (beings' metal-song vs. hush), resonant final image "quiet held her, and she held it back" reweights coexistence without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in vibration/ripple filters (e.g., "marks told her which passages sang true"); rhythmic control modulates from groaning caves to hushed absorption, stable close-3rd POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "notes that made her teeth ache" advance sensory pressure; no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm peaks in "silence was not empty but full," propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic world (resonant beings warping caves) via mapkeeper's tactile marks; risk in lyric hush-eye poise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
