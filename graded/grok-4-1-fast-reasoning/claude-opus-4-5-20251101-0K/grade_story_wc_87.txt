<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied shame (water biting calves, chest knot loosening) and contradictory impulses (paddle despite paralysis); earned stasis in keeping compass reveals values under regret pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure: tucking compass reconfigures navigation/memory with grief's "heavy as brass" cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Utility poles and compass as micro-settings constrain choices (navigation method) and charge final image; fog/water sensory narrowing mirrors internal softening under fog-grief parallel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action amid regret) signaled early, tightens via observation=trust realization post-cormorant; agency in solo paddling endures with visible emotional cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect navigation emerges via poles/compass shift, resonating non-literally in flickering faith image without moralizing; ambiguity in "maybe" futures lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (nautical intuition on poles as "sentinels"); rhythmic modulation builds melancholic propulsion, no leakage despite reflective density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor regret paraphrase early but purposeful under Accum lens, no closure-dulling loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh utility-pole navigation transforms grief trope into quirky, grounded ingenuity; quiet risk in lyric poise feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
