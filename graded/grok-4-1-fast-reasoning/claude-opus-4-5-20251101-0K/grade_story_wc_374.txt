<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's skepticism drives contradictory impulses—tasting undeniable truth yet demanding more—culminating in earned realization of her own weather; embodied via tongue/ring, with brother's loss as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via sensory revelations to CR closure: ring humming and leaf-tasting reconfigure her isolation into systemic purpose with conceptual merger cost; orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (chlorophyll ballots, metallic sweetness) constrain perception and charge final leaf image; lavender/aurora evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn weather carriers' why) tightens via arrivals' explanations, forcing skepticism's renunciation; agency in taking leaf forecloses doubt, but minor abstractness in forest election dilutes visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emergent connections reweights skepticism through tasting particulars, resonant in petrichor/possibility future without moralizing; brother's merger echoes her own, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct taste/perception signature biases all noticing; voice modulates lyrically under pressure, dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual (fog woman's anchor claim), stable single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety propels via sensory propulsion; minor metaphor density in opener ("lights bending toward her like questions") risks overwrite but pattern-taught and closure-clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting weather, forest elections, emergent compass transforms tropes into inevitable web; risk in synesthetic POV heightens stakes, fully committed premise.</comment>
