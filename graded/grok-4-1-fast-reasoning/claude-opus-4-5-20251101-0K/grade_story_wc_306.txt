<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Keeper's sincerely insincere professionalism and motivation to introduce nuance shine through micro-choices like chime positioning and final reflection; contradictory impulses (sincerity breaks her, insincerity useless) act in scene. Sera's desperation feels embodied in clutching the shard and crumpling face. Minor slip: keeper's epiphany on certainty as trap reads slightly diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chime interpretations build density toward Charged Poise closure in Sera's shifted shoulders and keeper's vulnerability image, with felt cost in "wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats." Single scene oriented by ~50 words (lighthouse at dawn); one tightening via bone chimes adding grief/relief. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind chimes as micro-setting constrain the keeper's reading of Sera and charge closure ("chimes settled into silence... stirred again"); dawn light interacts with shard. Sensory selection (breeze on chimes, sea view) purposeful and POV-biased toward liminal clarity. Spatial choreography clean in spiral stairs and crown.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Sera's search guilt vs. release) signaled early, deepens via chimes (doubt to grief/relief) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to "hold two truths" renunciation with relational cost. Agency in keeper's advice forecloses guilt path. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration vs. visceral payoff slips high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nuance in certainty emerges organically from mirror's emptiness as "space waiting to be filled differently" and chimes' interpretations; final image reweights prior doubt without moralizing. Subtext in silence and implication (sister "didn't want to be found"). Resonant non-literal answer in keeper's protected vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on keeper with perceptual signature (chimes as moral decoder, light/shadows liminal); voice rhythmic and textured ("thin as sea glass"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("permission to stop"); distinct idioms (Sera's whisper vs. keeper's professional poise). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "groaned against the coastal wind" advances setting/action); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (chimes' "minor key, hesitant") without muddle in peak advice beat. Propulsion clean to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience-as-chime-reader in lighthouse transforms moral guidance trope; wind chimes' mechanics and hollow shard create inevitable ingenuity. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
