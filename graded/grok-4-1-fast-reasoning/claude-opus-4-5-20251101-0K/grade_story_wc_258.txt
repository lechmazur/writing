<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's steady curiosity and Marcus's control obsession create earned contradiction, peaking in his Moon choice that reveals unconscious shift without tidy resolution. Interiority embodied via measurements and observations; micro-choices like shuffling expose values. Final endurance of her mapping project shows visible cost in patience amid desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: card choices and measurements build density toward CR closure in Moon selection and final mapping image, reweighting beliefs with patience cost. Orientation anchored early in loft and project; single scene causality via client data accumulation. No slips touch ending's conceptual payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain and skylight constrain mood and mirror Vera's patience, charging final unraveling image; onyx cards and tape tactilely guide choices. Sensory hierarchy (light-absorbing ink, drumming rain) reflects cartomantic priorities. Environment evolves with intensifying rain, pressuring Marcus's crack.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping myths) signaled early, deepens texturally via Marcus's Wheel-Emperor sequence then Moon reversal, narrowing to control illusion with patience cost. Agency in Vera's confiding and measuring; one tightening forecloses his disbelief. Cost legible in inherited endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of crisis-revealed myths emerges via card particulars, resonating in Moon choice reweighting control narrative without moralizing. Subtext in choices (83% stat) implies cultural architecture; final image offers non-literal answer to surrender question. Complexity in ambiguity of what clients reach for.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable on Vera's perceptual signature (measuring patterns, body confessions); dialogue subtextual (Marcus's "I don't believe" vs. reaching). Rhythm modulates with pressure, diction cartomantic (whispering cards). No head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor repetition ("watched his") contained pre-closure; metaphors consistent (rain patience). Peak beats clean, no figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot as cultural data-mining post-crypto crash transforms tropes via measurements and stats. Risk in analytical confiding heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in Moon revealing surrender pattern.</comment>
