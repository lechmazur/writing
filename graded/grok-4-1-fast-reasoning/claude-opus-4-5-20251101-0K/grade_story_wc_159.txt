<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's diamond-hard motivation to preserve names drives all micro-choices, embodied in tasting her daughter's lost name "like spring rain and copper pennies"; contradictory grief enables the final weeping endurance with visible cost. Interiority particular, flaws (regret) complicate without safety-hedging. Single-POV coherence exemplary, final ritual earned by causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tending to restoration climax with RR/Charged Poise closure as tube sings names into orchids, cost legible in "tears adding their own small music." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via song gathering emotions suffices. No lens ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal library's glass orchids and solidified moonlight constrain ascent/ritual, charging final rainbow refraction; foxglove regret mirrors internal state purposefully. Sensory selection POV-biased (emotional territories), vivid/evolving without stalls. Micro-setting (altar of echoes) alters tactics at peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore daughter's name/sound) signaled early, textural escalation via melody absorbing extinct emotions seals fracture, narrowing to cascade payoff with agency (humming lullaby). Cost unmistakable in tears/persistent regret foreclosing total loss. Coherent pressure under lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges organically from particulars (cracked tube to rooted names); final image of "hope [sharing space] with foxglove regret" reweights premise non-literally, with ambiguity lingering in ongoing work. No moralizing, resonance from struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "untranslatable griefs" and biased noticing of emotional galleries; rhythmic modulation heightens ritual intensity without filter excess. Voice texture distinct, syntax reflects crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm (short peak sentences in restoration); figurative layering (e.g., "drinking in resonance like parched earth") coherent/pattern-taught in lyric mode, no muddle/loops touching closure. Minor density slip in opening metaphors, but serves texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct emotions library transforms loss tropes via glass orchids/names; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from setup particulars to charged final rooting. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
