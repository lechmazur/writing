<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the pivot where Mara unstraps her satchel but halts, earning her renunciation through prior ascent struggles and self-doubt; interiority feels embodied in "softened her edges" and fingertip glow. Final stasis costs her measurable power, revealing values hierarchy. No safety-hedging or labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from ascent to garden realization; closure as CR in "She let the crystal fall back" reconfigures seeking into witnessing with conceptual cost of forgoing quantifiable magic. Orientation anchors early in Spire palm-press; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen flowers and "impossible geometry" constrain via mist walking necessity and charge final image of unnamed colors. Sensory filter via Mara's softening matches urgency; no tourist catalog, all goal-directed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred simple vs. automated power) tightens at keystone hesitation, narrowing to renunciation agency; cost felt in unclaimed glow mirroring her "fizzle." Accumulative deepening via spire pressures coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from refusal and "light that lingered because she had finally stopped trying"; final fingertips reweight automation premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like preserved petals avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature biases toward "brilliant dimness" and softening; rhythmic modulation peaks in mist-walking dispersal. No head-hopping; compression taught early via spire impossibilities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "light that had nowhere to go"; varied rhythm propels ascent without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "needle threading heaven" cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic era with internal "wondering" arc transforms mage-quest trope; risk in quiet refusal heightens stakes via irreplaceable spire logic. No hedging, fully committed premise.</comment>
