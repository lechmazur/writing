<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via static electricity sensing residual emotions; contradictory impulses (numbness vs. pure grief) act in the inhalation beat, earning the final permeable change with genuine tears as cost. Micro-choices like tucking the petal reveal values hierarchy. Blind spots (tolerance to synthetics) drive the inciting inhale and climax subsumption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from entrance sensing to dusk inhalation closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting numbness with tears and crystallized motivation; cost legible in "hemorrhaging into something messier." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains via accumulated emotions sensed electrically, charging final palm-press gratitude and petal-tuck image; sensory hierarchy (pine resin, static hum, fractured light) reflects Vera's priorities, mirroring internal dissolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (subsume numbness via pure emotion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening blotter grief to climax realization; agency in deliberate inhale forecloses clinical distance with emotional cost in tears, charging final image under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of synthetic vs. genuine feeling emerges organically from petal's compassion message and half-truth profession; final tuck offers resonant non-literal answer (gift for next soul), reweighting counterfeits toward empathetic fusion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (electrical emotion-mapping); rhythmic prose modulates from poised entry to compressed climax tears, diction biased to sensory chemistry; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged dusk image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "amber deposits caught the dusk light and fractured it into a thousand burning fragments" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor overwriting in metaphors consistent and voice-motivated, untouching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-dealing via scents/static transforms numbness trope into electrical transformation; petal's molecular message and grotto shelter pattern feel inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative lyric closure heightening stakes.</comment>
