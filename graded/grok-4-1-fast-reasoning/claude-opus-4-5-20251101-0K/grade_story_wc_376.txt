<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with wilting condition driving micro-choices like piecing the map; final inscription renunciation of ignorance earned by causal buildup of revelations. Contradictory impulses in shaking hands amid steady craft reveal hierarchy of values. Flawless single-POV execution with no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds to Archive CR, reweighting premise of lost words with emotional cost in "She wept as she listened." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; shards (workbench, journey, revelation) cohere without disorientation. Closure decisive with inscribed words foreclosing secrecy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Toxic sky and rust-scented tunnels constrain journey choices, charging final cathedral image; gilding tools as micro-setting enable inscription payoff. Sensory hierarchy (warm pane, clinking tools) reflects calligrapher's bias. No white-room; details evolve causally, mirroring wilted truth-seeking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth amid dishonesty) signaled early, deepens via map/journey to revelation tightening under Accumulative lens; agency in prying floorboards and playback forecloses ignorance path with wept cost. One reversal (tin box yield) narrows options viscerally. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pre-journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented candor emerges organically from map scraps to inscribed "Where lost conversations wait," reweighting mother's letter without moralizing; final image resonant CR answers "where lost conversations go." Subtext in silences (unfinished letter) invites ambiguity. No tidy binaries; embraces oblique costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (gold leaf precision amid decay); diction/rhythm modulate from precise ("zinc-etched postal plate") to charged ("cathedral of magnetic tape"). No head-hopping or filter excess; voice embodies wilting sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands never trembled...today they shook" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "soap bubbles refusing to burst" opening, but purposeful. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh Archive premise transforms lost-words trope into lived quest; risk in solo journey through unschematicked tunnels heightens stakes organically. Inscription turn inevitable from calligrapher traits/world logic. No derivative echoes; synthesis of post-apoc intimacy feels singular.</comment>
