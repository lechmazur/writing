<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line walker's peripheral awareness and balance of past/future embodied in engine room descent and consecration compel closure choice; "strangely honest" trait enables confrontation truth-telling with felt exposure cost. Keeper applies relational pressure without overshadowing. Minor tell in trait summary ("strangely honest for someone in my profession") avoids deeper contradiction deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: murmurs density builds to conjured clearing RR (Charged Poise) at consecration, reconfiguring preservation stakes with prophet's rage as conceptual cost ("You walk lines that should not be crossed"). Two-shard structure (pavilion to dunes/return) transitions legibly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion silks and kinetic parapet constrain tactics (descent/access, murmur channeling); dunes hum charges final image ("Somewhere beneath the sand, the engine hummed"). Sensory hierarchy (humming marble, stirring panels) reflects POV urgency without catalog; world rules consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve murmurs vs. prophet's silencing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via night saving under dawn threat; agency in peripheral guiding forecloses destruction path with on-page hesitation cost (followers pause). Escalation coheres without reversal overload; prophet's torches test commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wisdom amid erasure emerges organically from pavilion echoes to sealed clearing; final image ("sensing... the next dying song") offers non-literal reweighting of balance motif without moralizing. Subtext in honest reply ("I walk all lines") charges closure ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (peripheral awareness filtering); voice texture modulates rhythm from murmuring stir to whisperfield calm. Dialogue subtext-driven ("I cannot promise salvation. But I can promise to try"), distinguishes voices; no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("channeling the pavilion's murmurs into a newly conjured clearing"); rhythm varies with pressure, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in consecration ("intention and breath") borders overwrites but supports textural lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line-walking gift, kinetic machinery, conjured clearings transforms preservation trope; risk in invisible sanctuary payoff feels inevitable from parapet setup. Bold perceptual POV heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
