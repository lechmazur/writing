<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation rooted in brother's drowning compels light-weaving choices under pressure; interior contradiction in silence vs. action embodied in shutter adjustments. Boy's shift feels earned via observed response to patterns. Final endurance of vigil forecloses isolation path with ongoing cost, satisfying 9+ test; minor deduction as boy's interior remains opaque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from spiral to constellation to heart-beam, culminating in Charged Poise RR where boy's wave and departing silhouette reconfigure darkness-as-canvas with vigil's felt endurance cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in dock/canal/guardian setup. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "guardian remained at her post" and canal's shifted whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock and canal constrain boy's crouch and guardian's vigil, mirroring internal duality; dental mirror and shutters as micro-settings charge choices and final image of artificial-to-real stars. Sensory selection (pooled sky fragments, stillwater tension) reflects guardian's perceptual bias, evolving with light patterns. 9+ test: shutters/recurring water alter tactics and recharge ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing boy from courting darkness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via escalating patterns forcing his attention shift and stance crystallization in wave. Agency in guardian's weaving forecloses boy's submersion with cost of her perpetual vigil. One decisive deepening sufficient; high-band as pressure coheres but boy's response lacks micro-turn friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silent empathy and darkness-as-canvas emerge organically from shutter demonstrations, reweighting half-spoken secret via boy's witnessed turn. Final image of slipping mirror and stars offers non-literal resonant answer to isolation theme, charging prior motifs without moralizing. 9+ test passed; complexity in ambiguity of boy's future return lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/dark bias ("taught darkness the value of stars"); rhythmic modulation builds from calm description to pattern intensity. Lyrical compression taught early via mirror/shutters, legible at closure. No head-hopping or elision withholding; diction matches guardian's quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring pattern builds; metaphors coherent (nautilus spiral, scattered diamonds) without muddle in peak beam-to-heart beat. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; rhythm passes read-aloud test, accelerating to crisp closure image. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent light-language via dentist's mirror and boathouse shutters transforms grief trope into empathetic demonstration. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable ingenuity in "weaving meaning into geometric play," inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
