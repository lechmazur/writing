<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via tablet warmth and rune traces embodying fractured selves; contradictory impulses peak in descent then release of tablet, earning wholeness realization with felt cost of accepting endless splitting. Final choice aligns with prior micro-choices like tracing runes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rune patterns and timeline glimpses layer density to CR closure in "She was periodically eternal," reweighting fragmentation as wholeness with conceptual cost of no singular self; single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's glowing algae and rain-slick stones constrain descent/ascent choices and mirror internal paradoxes; "rain falling in sheets that turned the viaduct into a river of light" charges final image under darkening brightness motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conquer self-labyrinth signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening of rune configurations narrowing to acceptance; agency in retracing generates felt cost in foreclosed "center," legible in release moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of self as procedural labyrinth emerges organically from timeline shards and rune shifts; final "helix of possibility" reconfigures premise without moral, resonant via prior particulars like seventh timeline death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward paradoxes like "darkening brightness"; rhythmic control modulates from suspended poise to spiraling flight, with purposeful compression in realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose propulsion, varied syntax; minor repetition of "shifted" and "runes" purposeful under pattern but edges toward loop in mid-build, not touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation as self-labyrinth transforms multiverse trope; risk in lyric paradoxes like "space between the drop and the ripple" heightens stakes inevitably to wholeness CR.</comment>
