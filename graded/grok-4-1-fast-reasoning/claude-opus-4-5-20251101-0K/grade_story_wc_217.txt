<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find beauty in imperfection is rooted in traits and drives micro-choices like adding the feather, earning her philosophical affirmation. Interiority concrete via grandmother cue anchoring present action. Boy as secondary applies light pressure; minimal contradiction limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of incomplete objects (ink, feather, kite) builds density to Charged Poise closure as kite soars unevenly then steadily over lagoon, reweighting "different flight" with felt acceptance cost in "imperfect light" image. Orientation anchored early (lagoon, post-rain Mira). Single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (iridescent feather shift, rain-washed earth scent) selective via Mira's bias, constrain choices (feather found at waterline, kite on rocks). Lagoon/feather charge final soaring image, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend ruined kite via imperfection philosophy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through mending/adding feather, narrowing to "different flight" with agency/cost in boy's shift from dismay to curiosity and kite's wobble. Mild pressure limits intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incomplete emerges organically from feather/kite events, reweighted in final kite climb and Mira's writing as non-literal answer to woven dawns without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (imperfections as "honest"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("It won't be the same" tests philosophy). Rhythmic control modulates serene intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful figurative pattern (burnished hush, woven dawns) taught early pays off without muddle. Minor overwrite in descriptive beats (e.g., "polished glass") borders excess but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's imperfection philosophy with kite-mending transforms trope organically; feather-kite integration memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
