<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in trusting "texture of memories" over records act in scene via label touch and listening choice; final resolve to confront doctor earned by layered backstory anchors, foreclosing passive grief with cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments density tightens to Meridian overhead, yielding CR closure in "voice of someone who had already died"; cost legible in "presumed dead" patience atop rising tide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers constrain descent/climb amid tide; "mud flats where oldest containers rested, half-sunken monuments" mirrors internal erasure, charging final high-ground poise image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild erased histories) signaled early, deepened by overheard Meridian/poison pattern narrowing to doctor confrontation; agency in patient waiting forecloses erasure path with identity cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "irreducible weight of remembered lives" non-literally answers erasure question, reweighting fragments into monuments via layered particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias for "spaces between official records"; rhythmic diction like "breathed with the rhythm of tides" heightens textured immersion, dialogue snippet distinct/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "She held her breath. The Meridian had been her husband's ship" layers info without scaffold; varied rhythm, zero loops, specific verbs propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased woman layering whispers in tidal container maze transforms detective trope into textural monument-building; "evidence of an erased history that belonged to no one and everyone" inevitable fresh synthesis.</comment>
