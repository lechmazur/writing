<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in family legacy, embodied in the heart-clenching arrow tip moment; micro-choices like surrendering to water flow reveal values under pressure. Slight tidy progression to epiphany lacks stronger contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers and growth patterns build density to CR closure where "resilience was not a substance to be harvested but a practice," with conceptual cost of non-extractable knowledge legible in seed-planting. Orientation anchors immediately; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and water flow constrain navigation choices; whirling silence and mineral air charge inversion climax and final humming grove image. Sensory hierarchy (pilot's instruments, boot crunches) filters through urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early tightens via arrow tip/voices during inversion, forcing realization trade-off; agency in planting seed forecloses harvest path with felt legacy cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience from collective brokenness emerges organically via growing roots around arrow; grandmother's voice line slightly echoes thesis, muting pure subtext resonance despite charged final seed image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (water currents, gravity countdown) biases toward pilot priorities; rhythmic prose modulates from hum to whirling silence without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short inversion sentences accelerate); zero loops, no figurative muddle, clean propulsion to "grove hummed with welcome."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchards, echo accumulation as resilience source transforms tropes; gravity inversion/echo chorus risks bold inversion payoff heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
