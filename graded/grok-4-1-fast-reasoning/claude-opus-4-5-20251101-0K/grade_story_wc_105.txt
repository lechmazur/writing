<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with synesthetic trait concretely shaping perception and work; motivation intensifies through mother's memory-cue to earned realization of her own voice in the break ("It sounded like her own voice"). Contradictory impulses (belief vs. betrayal) act in the imprint beat; reflection anchors to present glass fragment without flattening pressure. Final renunciation of revenge for understanding earned with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density of absences builds to CR closure in imprint revelation with legible emotional cost ("Marina held the device against her chest and wept"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (descent to greenhouse); single scene coherent, no shards. Lens unambiguous at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world constrains choices (forge heated by vents for imprinting; pressure suit embodies fathoms of loss); shipwrecks supply fossils, aurora filters "singing green" to charge synesthetic perception and final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hears colors); details evolve tactilely (kelp sway, creaking sympathy). No white-room; 9+ gate met via forge/aurora shaping climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound of trust breaking) signaled early, tightens via imprint reversal narrowing understanding; agency in collecting/placing glass forecloses naivety with weep-cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively, reweighting options in "murky amber of disappointment" to her voice. One decisive deepening sufficient; cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memories as sonic fossils emerges organically from particulars (glass residue, fossil collection); final image ("forge cooled... battered marvel of a workshop holding steady") offers resonant CR repricing absence as audible with conceptual cost of enduring loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "perhaps it would help." Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (colors as "low hum... whispered vowels"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to compressed weep ("held the device against her chest and wept into her helmet"). Prose texture synesthetic and biased; no elision or head-hopping. Diction reflects mind under pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "aurora's light filtered... ribbons of singing green" advances setting, sensory, stakes); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts (paraphrase-free). Figurative purposeful and consistent (cathedral ribs, sonic fossils); propulsion clear to closure image. Zero scaffold; read-aloud propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, sonic absences, underwater forge transforms memory trope into tangible craft; premise (hearing aids for dead's absences) non-obvious, implications followed to CR without retreat. Risky lyric immersion heightens stakes; irreplaceable details (ashen forge imprint) feel inevitable. No derivatives.</comment>
