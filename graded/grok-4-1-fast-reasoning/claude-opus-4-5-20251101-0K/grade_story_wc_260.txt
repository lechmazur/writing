<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gentle hands trained for animals now strip pretense patiently, embodying contradiction between care and self-respect; micro-choices like cradling vial reveal values hierarchy with cost. Diagnostic phrasing like "balance self-respect and compassion" borders therapy-speak but anchors in vial/enclosure work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection density builds to Charged Poise closure in "enclosure frame stood complete... vial on shelf," reconfiguring betrayal into affirmed compassion with conceptual cost of mourned deceptions. Orientation anchored early in workshop/mist; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars constrains repair (starlight shifts tail colors, mist heavies as midnight nears); vial/enclosure as micro-settings charge final image, sensory hierarchy POV-biased (gentle hands tactile, owl hoot subtle). Details evolve causally with night-to-dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance self-respect/compassion post-betrayal) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via creature reflections tightening to enclosure rebuild; agency in reconstruction forecloses poisoned cynicism with felt cost ("not everything... lie"). Minor abstraction in stakes declaration tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of betrayed compassion rebuilding emerges via tail/enclosure images, final vial repricing as "reminder... of surviving deception" offers non-literal resonance reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vivid colors in death, mist breathing); rhythmic texture modulates from stillness to dawn cadence, diction character-specific (patient, gentle).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy work beats amid lyric flow); minor metaphor density ("stars wheeled... patient witnesses") purposeful for textural build, no loops obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctuary betrayal via chameleon tail/enclosure reconstruction transforms recovery trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
