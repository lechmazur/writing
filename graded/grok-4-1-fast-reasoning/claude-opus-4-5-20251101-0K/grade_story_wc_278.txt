<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation roots deeply in familial guilt, embodied in trembling hands reading letters and the decision to tattoo during the fold; contradictory impulses surface as she laughs at then verifies the amber's function. Final release—"a tether cut"—earned by prior causality with felt emotional cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like inherited dissonance complicate her search organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from letters/amber discovery to hearing translated sounds to tattooing constellation, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("dissonance quieted... tether cut") with legible conceptual cost in uncertainty over past change. Orientation anchored early (Vera in lab at fold). Single scene coherent; backstory interleaved anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lab's resonance chambers and fold constrain tattooing choice; amber as micro-setting handled tactilely, warming/syncing with heartbeat. Sensory hierarchy sound-focused (hums, cries, meteor hush); final dawn "tasted... like forgiveness" charges image. Vivid, selective, POV-biased without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hush inherited guilt—tightens via amber's translation deepening knowledge, narrowing to tattoo during fold; agency in mapping letters forecloses parallel frequencies with felt release cost. Accumulative escalation coheres without reversals. No abstract stakes; pressure viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of translating silences into heard love emerges organically from amber cries, unsent letters, tattooed constellation; final image ("dawn that tasted... forgiveness") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior dissonance without moralizing. Particulars drive irony and ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with sound-perceptual signature ("frequencies the world had forgotten"); rhythm modulates from hummed density to meteor hush release. Purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("time curled back... like smoke remembering flame"); metaphors consistent without muddle in peak tattoo beat. Minor overwriting in opening but purposeful; no loops, scaffolds, or closure-dulling artifacts. Propulsion clear to "amber cooled... still at last."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-preservation lab, amber firmware translating cries, letters-as-constellation transforms trope of ancestral guilt. Risky lyric premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight; no derivative templates, bold closure reconfigures time/forgiveness.</comment>
