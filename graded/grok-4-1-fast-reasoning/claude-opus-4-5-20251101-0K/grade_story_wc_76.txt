<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in daughter's loss drives all micro-choices, culminating in yoyo cast with embodied tremble; interiority particular via backward clocks as "prayer"; earned change forecloses normal time with exhilaration's terror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: stone coordinates → yoyo match → disassembly → glow → cast accesses time fold (DC/CR hybrid); cost legible in "chasing the laughter toward a moment he'd spent seventeen years trying to reach"; single scene, orientation anchored by arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent tide ("slow exhale...returns, slowly covering") constrains timing/closure; rocks "like vertebrae," backward stairs mirror obsession; selective sensory (light trail, laughter echo) charges final beam spin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unwind time for daughter) signaled via clocks/stone; causal tightening at yoyo reassembly narrows to "fall through something"; agency in casts forecloses fate with on-page cost of desperate chase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of desperation unlocking hidden causality emerges via stone/yoyo shift from warning to key; final image (tide hides path, lens spins wrong) reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of "whatever lay beyond."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("wrongness felt like home"); diction/rhythm modulate to peak ("bleak exhilaration flooded"); purposeful compression in reverse logic pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "gears within gears, springs coiled in directions that made his backward-running clocks seem pedestrian"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in "yoyo fell through something, trailing light."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hunger stone/yoyo as time mechanism transforms time-travel trope via reverse causality; risk in "unwound like thread" culminates inevitably in counterclockwise beam.</comment>
