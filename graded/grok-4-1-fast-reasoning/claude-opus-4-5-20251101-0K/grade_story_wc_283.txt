<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation as hourglass turner intensifies through discoveries, compelling shift from reversal to creation; interiority concrete via embodied actions like cataloging buttons. Final acceptance of keeper role earned by pattern causality, with felt cost of "weight of responsibility." Minor epiphanic phrasing at "She understood" lacks deeper contradiction but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button finds build pattern to constellation and jar reveal. Closure as CR reprices prophecy with conceptual cost in final climb ("carrying possibility... salvation in her pockets"). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse vividly constrains search (shelves, cracks, dust) and charges closure (silence settles like held breath). Sensory details (resin stalactites, honey crates) filter through Marlowe's priorities, mirroring internal shift from catastrophe-mending to beginning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy) signaled early, tightens via button constellation narrowing to jar; agency in methodical cataloging drives deepening under accumulative lens. Cost legible in role acceptance foreclosing reversal path. No reversal but cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom as rebuilding manual emerges organically from buttons-to-voices pattern, reweighting forgetting via final image without moralizing. Resonant CR answers "end with forgetting" non-literally; complexity in prophecy's dual nature lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (time as honey, thread); rhythm modulates from descent tension to inspired poise. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to Marlowe's restorative worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short discovery beats to flowing realizations); metaphors cohere around amber/time without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; final line recharges opening silence image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of buttons-as-memories constellation transforming prophecy into manual feels inevitable; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in forgetting-as-cleansing.</comment>
