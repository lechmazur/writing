<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's boredom and love for Maricel root clear motivation, with embodied interiority (teeth hurt by frequencies) and micro-choices (whispers to others) showing contradiction under storm pressure. Final change from stagnation to living feels earned via fragment's guide. Minor slip in direct epiphany phrasing ("immortality's curse wasn't living forever") edges below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: storm disruption builds density to spatial mutiny, intrigue tightens, CR closure lands on-page ("boredom...began to crack," fragment burns) with conceptual cost of shedding permanence. Orientation anchored in opening lines; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint of prison walls shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite vividly sensory (crystalline walls refracting unearthly light, singing frequencies), filters through Vera's dimensional awareness, constrains choices (storm reorganizes into corridors). Final space "hushed thunder" charges closure image, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting (amulet fragment) enables map reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape stagnation via goodbye's threshold) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intrigue and mutiny tightening options; agency in "careful words" and stepping through forces trade-off. Cost legible in Aldric's scream, collapse, fragment's burn charging final poise. No agency-driven 9+ under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over permanence emerges organically from fragment-map, mutiny, to CR ("goodbye was a door, not a wall") reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image of colorless light resonates prior boredom/prism motifs non-literally. Complexity in refusing tidy reunion with Maricel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sensing "membrane-thin boundaries," spatial fabric vibrations); voice texture poetic yet biased (boredom "achingly"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've freed us"). Minor register elevation in epiphanies prevents 9.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., storm "disrupted everything" cascades); rhythm varies for crescendo. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dimensions folded like origami") coheres but clusters slightly in climax without obscuring. No loops/artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal boredom trope via dimensional prison, solar storm-map to post-goodbye transformation; risk in abstract "hushed thunder" space pays off in CR. Inevitable hindsight from fragment's early pulse; no derivative echoes.</comment>
