<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stellar doubt acts simultaneously with quiet enthusiasm in repeated castings despite growing certainty, earning final full embrace; coins-on-edge impossibility reveals values hierarchy with dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as coin castings densify toward static-decode and edge-landing CR; "every coin landed on edge" delivers legible conceptual cost of un-becoming as transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ambered deck constrains readings via console/table/receivers and charges closure glow; blue-shifting stars mirror doubt, filtering through Mira's signal bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Doubt-as-stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through message reversal and perfect alignment, forcing acceptance; edge-landing forecloses doubt with transformation trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of dissolution-as-becoming emerges implicitly via backwards signals and coin spiral; final "universe remember her into being" reweights prophecy non-literally without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases chaos toward patterns; rhythmic modulation from doubt ("stellar doubt crept") to poise sustains cosmic intimacy without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels via varied syntax; "coins...fell toward outcomes already determined" line exemplifies clear, multi-job precision untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reversing-probability divination in contracting cosmos synthesizes fresh alignment quest; edge-balanced coins riskily heighten stakes, transforming end-times via lived particulars.</comment>
