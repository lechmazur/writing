<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in failed portraits dissolving into "eyes that belonged to different people"; redesign choice earned by prior block and thread pull, foreclosing unity with cost of world's potential rejection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via walls contracting and lantern intensifying to charged poise closure in redesigned portrait shifting "depending on the angle," with cost legible in lighthouse exhale and "honest incompleteness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library shelves "pressed inward" constrain redesign urgency; lantern's "amber grief" charges final image, mirroring internal fragmentation through tactile dust and groaning walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively as walls close, forcing redesign agency that narrows options from fixing to layering; cost unmistakable in "ready to return to a world that might not understand."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fragmentation theme emerges organically from layered failures to prism portrait, final image resonating as non-literal answer to "portrait... window or prism?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with artistic perceptual signature (faces as "negotiations"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "shades of amber grief," eliding nothing essential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or muddled metaphors in peak redesign beat, propulsion clear in "layering transparency over opacity."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes lighthouse as introspective crucible for fragmented art epiphany, transforming block trope via thread-untangling to shifting portrait frame.</comment>
