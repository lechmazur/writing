<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veren's motivation to belong is embodied in reed-weaving choices that drive the search; contradictory impulses shine in her marginal watching turning to active sculptures. Secondary characters like Senna mirror her flaw effectively at climax. Minor weakness: Mira/Thom/Pell named but apply no distinct pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as symbol patterns and sculptures build density to Senna's discovery under the arbor. Closure as resonant reconfiguration lands with cost of isolation foreclosed in "we dedicated ourselves." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via ritual suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain search sites and charge final image of trees scattering light as "new tongues." Sensory details selective through Veren's transformative bias. Spatial choreography clear across rows and arbor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging signaled early, deepens accumulatively through shared ritual narrowing isolation options. Senna's fear makes cost visceral at reveal; agency in sculptures forces communal crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of offering strangeness for community emerges organically from sculptures to final "webs of kinship" image answering isolation. Resonant without moralizing; ambiguity in ache lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of transformation-noticing; dialogue sparse but subtextual in Kael's invitation. Rhythm modulates pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but dense figuratives like "wounded with beauty" border overwriting in opening without payoff. No loops; propulsion strong to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reed-tags in crystalline world transforms belonging trope; tag as "roots or rivers" pattern feels inevitable to arbor vigil.</comment>
