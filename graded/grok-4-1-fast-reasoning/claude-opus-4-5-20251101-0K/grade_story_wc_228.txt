<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Edwin's motivation to honor the promise via the seashell anchors choices, embodied in "colors now faded but still warm enough to hurt"; internal conflict between backward gaze and creation earned through painting reveal without unearned epiphany. Minor diagnostic summary in "He understood now" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mirror sign to cave discovery to painting CR closure with impermanence cost legible in "This chamber would flood" and renewed quay drive. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via unintended path suffices. Lens coherent to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave specifics ("phosphorescent life," "ancient hands reaching") constrain via tide whisper and charge final mirror-shards image mirroring fragmentation theme. Sensory hierarchy artistic/POV-specific; evolves causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor promise, break backward gaze) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in painting reveal narrowing options to integration; cost felt in "temporary eternity" acknowledgment foreclosing pure nostalgia. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art as enduring promise emerges organically from shell, painting merge, and quay return; final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; "temporary eternity" integrates as earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with artistic perceptual signature ("scuttled like living punctuation"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, diction POV-apt. No elision issues; voice distinct and pressure-responsive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak painting beat. "Intimately aloof" phrasing purposeful; rhythm breathes with scene without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cave-oasis for ancient/modern artists transforms nostalgia trope via painting revelation; fresh synthesis of shards, shell, quay feels inevitable. Minor familiarity in epiphanic artist journey tempers peak band.</comment>
