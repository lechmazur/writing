<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Painter's motivation to persuade mirrors roots consistently in traits like patience, shown in deliberate strokes; borrowed heartbeat adds particular depth with old woman's wish. No strong contradictory impulses in scene limit to 8.4; calm dominates without embodied conflict at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to charged poise in final shimmering image, reconfiguring reflection with conceptual cost of borrowed heartbeats and vanishing. Orientation anchored early in terrace/prism after rain; closure cost legible in "painting shimmered, its mirror showing... possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet after rain constrains painting (light refraction essential) and charges final image with embedded rainbows; sensory hierarchy (hush, light fragments) reflects painter's perceptual priorities. Vivid, selective integration via action like light playing across parapet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete mirage before bells) signaled early, tightens texturally via borrowed heartbeat integration and figure's definition, narrowing to timely grace under hush. Cost felt in heartbeat trade-off and vanishing, charging final poise; minor abstractness in stakes legibility holds from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reflection as revelation emerges organically from painting process and final image of girl "strong, beloved, whole"; resonant non-literal answer reweights mirrors without moralizing. Mirror persuasion motif shifts via concrete events, inviting ambiguity in possibility vs. reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (light as "fragments of possibility," mirrors as "active witnesses"); rhythmic modulation builds to prayer-like wrist turns. Elevated diction fits ethereal voice; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands moved with perceptive calm... painting guided her"); varied rhythm supports hush-to-bells propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "colors that shouldn't exist" slightly muddles peak strokes, docking from 9; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elusive artist with borrowed heartbeats persuading mirrors transforms mystic trope; "borrowed heartbeats" premise follows implications to pulse in painting without retreat. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in crystalline timeframe, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
