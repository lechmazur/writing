<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marta's characterization excels with embodied senses (nose from decay to life traces) and contradictory impulses acting in the digging scene, earning her final choice to follow the living with visible cost of abandoning retirement. Ven applies precise secondary pressure via the riddle without stealing focus. Flawless internal progression from body-finder to life-seeker anchors motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent/memory/discovery density building to Charged Poise closure ("gathered the map, the leaf, and the last of her courage"), with legible cost in foreclosed past life; orientation anchors firmly by para 2. One tightening at pit dig suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scrapyard details (compressed cars, rust-bleeding pit) constrain choices (digging site) and charge final image (metal dreaming earth echoes leaf/settlement transformation). Sensory hierarchy via bloodhound nose filters post-apoc wildness perfectly. Micro-setting (compost pit) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite via personal ciphers) tightens accumulatively through riddle/pit/map, forcing agency (run, dig, walk) with felt cost of isolation; one deepening at leaf discovery narrows options to pursuit. Minor abstractness in eastern "impassable" territories slightly mutes visceral price legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation (growing things/end, metal-to-earth) emerges via particulars (leaf, pit, grooves), reweighting death-search to life-pursuit in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Sera's breadcrumb agency invites ambiguity on belief's cost. Resonant non-literal answer in eastward gaze.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with bloodhound perceptual signature (scent over sight) and rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences in dig). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("She left you a riddle"), distinguishing Ven's caution. No head-hopping; voice textured without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (long atmospheric opens to punchy actions) and zero loops; metaphors cohere (rust painting, hush deepening) without muddle in peak dig/closure beats. Minor scaffold in opening fridge perch ("graying muzzle twitching") but integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc bloodhound POV with analog cipher (grooves/leaf) transforms tropes into inevitable riddle-path; risk in anthropomorphic depth heightens emotional stakes without gimmick. Transformation test passes: swap elements breaks cipher intimacy.</comment>
