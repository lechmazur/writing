<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in inversion beat ("chest stretching contracted, expanding and tightening") revealing embodied panic vs deliberate listening; final renunciation of fear-driven limits earned via layered silences with doll's accumulating weight as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as silences densify to "possibility" hush absorbed on-page; Charged Poise closure ("Tomorrow, she would climb higher") reconfigures stance with conceptual cost of deferred bunker confrontation, persistent doll weight shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Xenial trellis and inverted vines constrain choice by suspending Mira amid welcoming growth that combats panic, charging closure via permanent "directions that no longer made physical sense" mirroring her shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming fear via silences) deepens agency-driven during inversion endurance, reweighting via hush absorption; unmistakable cost in doll's "weight increase in ways that defied measurement" foreclosing old panic patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contrasting silence "flavors" (bunker dense vs. gilded possibility) emerge organically to reweight father's walls through vine image, offering non-literal answer to exposure-vs-limits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature frames silences as tasted/weighed ("tasted like possibility"); rhythmic modulation from tight panic sentences to expansive hush sustains close third-person without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in inversion ("buds emerged and climbed downward") with varied rhythms propels without loops or artifacts; coherent metaphors (vines as growth) sharpen peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence-collection as flavored/weighted premise synthesizes fresh sensory fantasy with claustrophobia escape; vine inversion risks heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doll's evolving load.</comment>
