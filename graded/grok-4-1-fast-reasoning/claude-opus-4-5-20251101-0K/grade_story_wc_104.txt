<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scout's trembling rifle and hovering finger embody internal war of duty vs. desperation, forcing Mira's persuasive micro-choice; her chained decoding reveals patiently strategic endurance with visible physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through decoding → scout arrival → mercy → vault descent, landing DC closure in seed-pocketing amid rumbles, with legible cost in persistent chains and collapsing wall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Piano bench keys and forgotten toys constrain decoding choice and mirror unclaimed prizes theme, charging final empty carnival image; dust motes and yellowed keys filter through Mira's urgent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens at scout confrontation, narrowing options via signal arrow threat; agency in whispered persuasion forces trade-off, with time/cost felt in "distant rumbles announced the wall's first fractures."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seeds and chains recur to reweight liberation premise non-literally in final stride; mercy beat yields emergent theme of resilience-through-impossibility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias in "patterns where others saw noise"; dialogue subtext in "I'm a farmer's daughter who learned to pick locks" pursues goal while revealing character idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies in scout beat from short pleas to held-breath fade; no loops, high density in key-decoding without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keys-as-staff code transforms carnival decay into musical secrecy, synthesizing post-Scorch stakes with fresh ingenuity; arrow reprise risks symbolic without gimmick.</comment>
