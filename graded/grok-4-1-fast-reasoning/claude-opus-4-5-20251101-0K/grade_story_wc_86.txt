<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to recycle brother's mistakes into wisdom drives her presence and fair terms, with contradictory impulses (excuse vs. abandon) embodied in gripping the drawer pull and holding off his apology. Internal conflict acts in scene via micro-choices under personal pressure. Final renunciation of quick apology earns relational stasis with felt cost on her gaunt brother's weighted eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wait → Varen arrives → dialogue tests stakes → moon clears → prisoners untether and cross → descent reconfigures family bond. Closure as Charged Poise in "space between apology and forgiveness stretched before them," with cost legible in deliberate silent steps and erased footprints. Orientation anchored in parapet/mist by para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist, crumbled parapet, and moon constrain tactics (15 paces, sync timing) and charge final image (mist erases footprints). Sensory hierarchy via Mira's negotiator bias: moisture-heavy coat, shifting gray silhouettes. Details evolve causally (clouds thin overhead) mirroring internal mist between forgiveness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brother's exchange) signaled early, tightens via perfect moon timing narrowing to countdown. Agency in Mira's "On my count... Agreed?" forecloses violence path with relational cost on brother's gaunt face. Causal escalation coherent; one decisive deepening sufficient, though external pressure leans verbal over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile peace from personal flaws emerges via neutral moon, drawer pull reprise, and final road image reweighting brother's recklessness as earned wisdom. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like "recycle her brother's mistakes into wisdom" crystallized in sleepless motivation tying to closure. Ambiguity lingers in deliberate walk without tidy forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Mira's perceptual signature (historical anchors like drawer pull, treaties). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Superstition?" → "Practicality") distinguishes voices; rhythm modulates from hushed tension to silver-lit release. Prose texture biased to negotiator's precision without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "moon broke through... silver light across storm-worn stones" advances timing, atmosphere, climax). Varied rhythm/syntax propels (short countdown vs. flowing descent); zero loops, clean causation in "counted down from three, and then it happened." No overwriting in peak exchange beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: moon-sync neutrality transforms prisoner trope via personal forgiveness arc and drawer pull anchor. Risk in quiet emotional closure heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable moon/parapet logic feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
