<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of anger and forgiveness act simultaneously in the tuning/forgiveness beat, earning the clasp's opening with 17-year emotional cost; particular traits shown via philosophy and micro-choices like striking forks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of silences/frequencies to RR closure in clasp click and realization; cost legible in "seventeen years" surrender as fireworks shatter stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop and tuning forks constrain choices; stars and fireworks evolve to charge final image of silence inside sound, with sensory hierarchy via Vera's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of cataloging pre-fireworks silence deepens via frequency strikes to forgiveness agency, narrowing anger path under Accumulative lens; cost felt in heart's wait, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via vibration/non-force emerges organically from particulars, resonating in CR of "silence inside sound"; minor slip in final platitude "love was simply attention sustained over time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward silences/frequencies with rhythmic control modulating to climax; stable close-third POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but purple stacking like "painting the air with colors only the heart could see" slightly dulls peak tuning beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum/Buddhist tuning for emotional recovery feels inevitable; risk in frequency-empathy mechanic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
