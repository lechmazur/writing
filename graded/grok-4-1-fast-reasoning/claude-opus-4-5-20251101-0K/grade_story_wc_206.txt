<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Elias recognizes his dishonest hope for resurrection during the fourth box, forcing an embodied confession that earns the final renunciation with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as box-winding density builds to wilting reversal and dawn closure (Charged Poise), with cost legible in "The chip had dimmed to nothing, its light dispersed"; orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's copper walls and focal point constrain box arrangement and harmonics, charging final transmutation; sensory details (humming, pulsing light) filtered through Elias's repairman perception narrow with rising pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tether light before midnight) signaled early tightens via wilting reversal that forces honesty trade-off, escalating density under Accumulative lens; agency in confession narrows options with renunciation cost felt in chest-fading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transcending decay (rust covenant honored) emerges organically from rust transmuting to "copper stars," reweighting memory/future in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to "mend what isn't torn."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("songs things wished to sing") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful poetic diction taught early remains legible, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and coherent metaphors (rust as "minor key"); no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull propulsion, even in peak wilting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of philosopher's stone as music-infused chip and "covenant of rust" transforms alchemy tropes via repairman's lens; risk-taking in accumulative tinkersong cadence heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
