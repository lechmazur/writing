<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reckless idealist shines in descent despite dismissal and hole in chest embodied as shadow-life; contradictory impulses peak in accepting uncertainty over emptiness, earned by causal buildup to "I accept."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via backstory confession driving descent, card offer, sacrifice demand, and DC closure at chest-shift with legible cost of frayed destiny; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots through bones constrain path to oldest tree and charge final emergence into darkness as possibility; sensory glow and moss filter Mira's meaning-inlaying bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim destiny tightens via Gardener's uncertainty trade-off, agency in acceptance foreclosing certainty with on-page cost crystallized in "wounded bird"; causal escalation narrows options cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bartered destinies theme emerges via ledger skulls, roots embracing bones, to final reclaimed-but-frayed fate reweighting certainty's value; resonant image of night-as-possibility answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature of inlaying meaning; dialogue subtext-laden (Gardener's "wind through bone" laugh), rhythm modulates from descent tension to resolved smile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (roots snaking femurs) integrated into action; no loops or overwriting, propulsion peaks at "something shift in the darkness behind her ribs."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb orchard transforms underworld-deal trope via mineral-fed apples and soul-ledger bones; risk in dusky closure heightens reclaimed destiny's cost without gimmick.</comment>
