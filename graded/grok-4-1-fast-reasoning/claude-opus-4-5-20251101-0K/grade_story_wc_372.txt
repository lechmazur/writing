<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal choice of child's vow amid collapsing shelves reveals contradictory impulses to save all versus one, earned by prior measurements with embodied cost in her steady hands despite tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as resonance density builds to capture; closure as Charged Poise in "Elara raised the magic lantern slide and captured the light," reconfiguring options with library's dissolution cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library and cloud sea constrain measurements and final walk, charging image of "quartz tower crumbled into starlight"; cracks in floors and churning sea evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaningful preservation tightens via resonant vows (lullaby, brotherhood) to indivisible choice; agency in measuring forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in "shelves of luminous vows cascaded into brilliance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of selective meaning emerges organically; final "someone would always remember them remembering" non-literally reweights hoarding vows, resonant via slide's pulse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of precision ("gently meticulous precision"); rhythmic modulation from hush to "wild and beautiful and free" heightens pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulatively; no loops or muddled metaphors, e.g., "breath forming small clouds that froze and fell like snow" integrates sense and momentum cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable vows and selective oblivion transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric collapse pays off inevitably in slide's forward carry, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
