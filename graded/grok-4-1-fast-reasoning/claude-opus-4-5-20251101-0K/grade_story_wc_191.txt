<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meridia's wise caution (methodical peeling) contradicts ruler ambition, compelling the final step-through with earned cost of age and reluctance; interiority particular via lore-keeper lens on "scattered data points."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mural revelations tightening to central tree shimmer; on-page Charged Poise closure ("first stair materialize") reconfigures options with dawn-seal cost legible in final climb image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prismatic waterfall and circuitry bark constrain entry/peeling choices; ruby flake as micro-setting charges final dissolution, mirroring internal resolve in "translucent doorway."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stairway claim before dawn) deepens accumulatively through murals narrowing to trunk; agency in ruby-press forecloses hesitation with time-cost felt in "dawn approached" escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Legitimacy-through-lore emerges implicitly from succession trees to throne climb; final "stories... meant to be continued" reweights modern fragmentation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature filters sci-fi details via lore bias ("droplets gleamed like scattered data points"); rhythmic diction modulates from cautious ("worked methodically") to poised climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere without loops (e.g., "peeling back layer after layer until the final mural blazed"); varied rhythm propels to crisp closure image, zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sci-fi orchard with paint-map succession trees transforms mythic quest via circuitry/lore synthesis; "bark... becoming a doorway" turn feels inevitable from mural pattern.</comment>
