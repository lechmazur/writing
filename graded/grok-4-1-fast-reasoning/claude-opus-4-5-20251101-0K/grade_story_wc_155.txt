<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion culminate in genuine laugh escaping during painting, earning the realization of joy as practice; minor deduction for occasional diagnostic phrasing like "hollowed her spirit" that borders therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to charged closure via Conceptual Repricing in "joy was not a destination but a practice"; cost legible in bittersweet healing of art-commerce breach, fragment lightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-bound orchard constrains light-painting and charges final glowing mural image; selective sensory details like "fog-dampened wall" and skeletal trees mirror internal recovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy deepens accumulatively through unplanned patterns emerging and fragment integration, forcing trade-off of commercial hollowing; cost felt in "bittersweet but nourishing" pensive mirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as communion emerges organically from light-mural creation and old techniques; resonant final image of approving fragment reweights prior hollowing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in artist's noticing of faded murals and light flows; rhythmic prose modulates from dreamy to charged laugh without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor scaffold in repeated fog presses and "glowing" motifs, but purposeful for tone; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural network, light-painting, and fresco in foggy ruins transforms artist-reawakening trope; risk in sci-fi daydream frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
