<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to excavate truth drives consistent micro-choices like reassembling letters and digging up the diamond, with embodied reactions like "cold settle in her chest" and trembling hands revealing character under pressure. Blind spots in Consortium lies propel her without safety-hedging. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal diamond moment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build from mutations to letters to diamond, culminating in Charged Poise closure where she packs the diamond and orchard aids exit, reconfiguring options with felt weight/cost in "hands trembled... weight of what it represented." Orientation anchors immediately in orchard/post-liquidation. Lens taught early via observations, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting constrains via contaminated soil, Geiger silence at stillpoint, dust storms parting; recurring mutated apples charge final image of glowing fruit and "radiation being transformed." Sensory hierarchy (respirator, bones feel absence) filters through Maya's observant bias. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. Consortium lie) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter revelations narrowing to diamond proof, forcing agency in taking samples amid storm. Cost legible in trembling hands and implied exposure risk. One deepening suffices; minor abstractness in "end their monopoly" before on-page test holds back peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming poison (radiation/lies) into life/truth emerges organically via orchard proof and final "scatter it... like seeds, and watch what grew." Resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; returning orchard image shifts from grotesque to hopeful. No tidy binaries or statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in details like "matching torn edges, ink consistencies, paper grain." Prose texture modulates rhythm with pressure (short sentences in storm/diamond beats). No dialogue or head-hopping; diction fits post-apoc skeptic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "Geiger counter screaming until... falling silent" advance setting/pressure. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; specific verbs/nouns (gnarled trunks, spiral patterns). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc conspiracy with sci-fi diamond resonance transforming radiation grounds tropes in specifics like Siberian mine flaw. Risky stillpoint concept heightens stakes organically. Minor proximity to wasteland survivor archetype slightly tempers peak.</comment>
