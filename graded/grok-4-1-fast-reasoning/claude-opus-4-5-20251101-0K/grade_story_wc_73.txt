<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses—stubborn hope against endless climb—embody grief/hope tension, culminating in earned hand-press at rupture with visible endurance cost tied to father's death cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dice roll to crack discovery, delivering Charged Poise CR at crack-seal with conceptual cost of perpetual grief-loop legible in "new staircase... slightly more warmth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains choices (endless climb forces dice-test) and charges final image (warmer stone post-rupture), with pale light absorption mirroring internal absorption of loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture grief-texture) tightens via dice-led crack under Textural lens, narrowing to rupture-agency with on-page cost of sealed crack trapping her in warmer infinity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief/hope perpetual loop emerges organically from proofs and rupture, resonant non-literal answer in final dice-rattle reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with mathematical perceptual bias ("stress fractals, golden ratio"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "final proof completed itself... elegant and terrible."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor metaphor pile-up ("groaned... universe clearing its throat... equations cascading") slightly muddles peak rupture clarity without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infinite staircase as grief-engine transforms perpetual motion trope, with rupture turn inevitable from dice/chalk particulars heightening stakes organically.</comment>
