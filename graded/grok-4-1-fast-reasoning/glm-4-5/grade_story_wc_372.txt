<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's gently meticulous trait aligns actions with preservation motive, shown in precise ledger work and slide handling. Internal surge of hope at sampler results feels earned via accumulative detail under textural lens. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance reads competent without raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oriented early in frozen library with Elias's duty; single scene accumulates to Charged Poise closure via discovery of resilient vows and reinforcement path. Textural lens holds with density tightening at "patterns told a story of diminishing power, but also of resilience." Cost legible in "painstaking" future work foreclosing ease.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush "physical presence against his skin" and pulsing library constrain meticulous work; recurring ice-windows and brass sampler charge final brightening. POV-filtered details mirror internal resolve without tourist catalog. Body/tool as micro-setting enables precision choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve fading vows signaled early; textural escalation via sampler hum to hope surge narrows to reinforcement trade-off with "painstaking" cost. Agency in measurements drives one decisive deepening. No live antagonist but coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning from oblivion emerges via vow patterns shifting from faint stars to pulsing vigor, reweighting illusions' fade. Final image of slide aloft offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like starlight fragments avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in precise, hushed noticing; voice texture modulates from quiet hush to brightening pulse. Rhythmic control in short chime sentence heightens under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: "gently meticulous" x2, exact "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeat, "while illusions faded to memory" x2, "quartz hush" x3 dull propulsion. Template cadence in repeated "Elias [action]" stems across measurements. Density suffers from synonym churn in duty descriptions; closure image intact but dragged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh fantasy synthesis of measurable light-promises in cloud library transforms preservation trope via frequency sampling. Final slide reprise feels inevitable from particulars. Risks poetic accumulation without gimmickry.</comment>
