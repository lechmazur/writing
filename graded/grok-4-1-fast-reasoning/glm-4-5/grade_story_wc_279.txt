<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas's social perceptiveness drives mandala creation and interjection against zealots, but embodied emotions like "lilac unease" remain poetic abstractions without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sand patterns amplify grotto whispers into cultural memory, culminating in CR via collective mandala where hush reconfigures from unease to contentment with disassembly cost legible in "began to disassemble the mandala."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustics constrain Silas's back-to-entrance work and enable pattern resonance, charging final image of mist-thickened coexistence; sensory hush absorbs sound purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find meaning tightens via zealots' arrival, mandala adjustment forces interjection narrowing options under Accumulative lens, with temporary cost felt in collective acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in chaos emerges organically through mandala evolution, final image of shared truths reweights unlearning without moralizing, resonant via emergent hush shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters through artistic bias (whispers, patterns), rhythmic diction modulates from unease to contentment without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion without loops or scaffolds; minor elevated diction in "lilac unease" borders overwriting but doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic tile, sand mandalas, and unlearning transforms artist trope into inevitable collective revelation without derivative echoes.</comment>
