<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to ground spirits via silence accumulation drives unraveling convincingly, rooted in her brokenness and attribute; embodied tremors and conduit role reveal character under pressure. Internal conflict summarized ("broken in ways no craft could mend") rather than shown in contradictory impulses during climax beat. Self-mend at end ("one tiny section...repaired") borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: unraveling builds hush density to cadence shift at "net fell away...profound stillness." Closure as RR (spirits grounded, unrest to peace) with legible cost in Elena's subtle repair and secret's release. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary; single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's fractured light mirrors fragmentation, evolves to "patterns...like mended masks" charging closure image. Selective sensory (starlight bending unnaturally, pulsing energy) filters via Elena's bias, guides needle work tactilely. Net as micro-setting constrains unraveling tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via hush) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through knot-by-knot deepening ("each knot...whisper of history"), narrowing to final stillness. Agency in unraveling forecloses unrest with personal cost felt in self-mend. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of untangling knots (literal nets, inner fractures) for silence-as-gift emerges organically via events, reweighted in final "lucid...peace." Resonant non-literal answer in starlight patterns evoking mended masks. No moralizing; ambiguity in secret lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (silence-gathering bias shapes noticing); poetic diction/rhythm modulates for hush density. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven ("The net...suffering"); distinct from narration. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("conductor...fireflies") risks coherence (−0.4); minor hush/interlaced repetition borders loop. Varied rhythm aids ear test; strong verbs, no scaffolds. Opening anchors stakes poetically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of silence accumulation, net-unraveling, and spirit-grounding transforms tropes into fresh conceit; irreplaceable in hush climax. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes without obscurity; inevitable hindsight from attribute to gift.</comment>
