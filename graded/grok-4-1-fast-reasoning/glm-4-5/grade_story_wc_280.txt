<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's synesthetic perception grounds concrete interiority and motivation tied to lost life/wife, culminating in earned dissolution with essence cost. Mild internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak singing beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes build density of temporal ribbons intertwining to Charged Poise closure in final bow/dissolution, with felt spectral flickering cost on-page. Single scene oriented early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synesthetic details (colors singing, scents blooming) filter through POV bias, with stone stage as micro-setting constraining sacred performance and hedges bouncing echoes to charge healing. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal nostalgia without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save timeline/garden) signaled early, escalates via accumulative echo density tightening to dawn pressure, narrowing to essence-pouring agency with flickering cost. One deepening suffices, cohering under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of enduring hope through art/loss emerges organically from memory echoes and final garden renewal/ghost fade, reweighting encores as redemption without moralizing. Resonant non-literal close in "young tenor would discover," inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct synesthetic perceptual signature (thunder-taste glow, melody-colors); rhythmic lyricism modulates to intensity in singing without slippage. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful synesthetic metaphors, but minor figurative density in climax ("golden threads," "scent of starlight") borders overwrite without muddle; varied rhythm propels to closure image. No loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost tenor weaving timelines via song transforms ghost/redemption tropes into fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk-taking in sensory premise heightens stakes organically to final reprise.</comment>
