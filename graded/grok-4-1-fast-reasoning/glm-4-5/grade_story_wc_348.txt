<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via nature-analogies revealing career-family conflict; contradictory grief/curiosity impulses act simultaneously in foam-tracing beat. Earned change in phone call with relational cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "motivation crystallized" borders therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in sister call and chrysalis reweighting, with felt cost in "I need to atone." One tightening via foam insight narrows isolation to connection. Single scene with ellipses fits scope; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ravine/river foam/chrysalis specifics constrain insight choice and charge final polymer sketch image. Sensory selection (foam swirls, light shift) mirrors internal harmony via POV bias. No white-room; evolved details ground reflection without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile post-argument isolation) signaled early; foam insight deepens via lens, forcing call agency with admission cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively, foreclosing solo path. No abstract stakes; relational price legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Connection theme emerges organically from polymer/river motifs, resonant in final sketch reweighting separation. Earned via foam struggle, avoids platitudes. Direct lines like "science didn't have to be separate" verge on thematic echo, muting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with symphonic-scientific perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from grief to hope. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-rich ("paths...intersect"). No head-hopping; diction biased to chemist lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for reflection peaks. Purposeful chrysalis/river repeats pattern-taught. Paraphrase loops in "divergent path"/connection phrasing (e.g., multiple mid-story echoes) drag momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh polymer-river-music-family synthesis transforms isolation trope via foam insight turn. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in charged polymer sketch. No templates; particulars inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
