<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in "her mind already calculating pathways," rooting resourcefulness in linguistic traits that drive micro-choices like using dialects for extraction; contradictory calm amid "racing heart" embodies pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as diary discoveries layer to renegotiation and entry, delivering CR closure in "weight of countless unlearned lessons shifting" with cosmic cost legible; orientation anchored immediately in bookstore and time traveler's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Botanical/textual setting constrains via "shelves twisted like climbing vines" and ink guardians reshaping, charging final "mountainous form breathing"; sensory selection mirrors Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (library access for rescue) signaled early tightens accumulatively at guardian confrontation, forcing renegotiation agency with embodied cost ("racing heart"); pressure coheres to extraction without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of gaps-as-doors emerges organically from diary passage and rescue, resonating in final "silent promise" image that reweights knowledge without moralizing; complexity lingers in sacred/urgent opportunities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic/botanical diction ("dialects that could soothe angry text") sustains third-limited POV; guardian dialogue carries subtext via "hovering script," natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, propelling from "echoes of unheard symphony" to closing sigh; minor recurrence of "unheard symphony" pattern-taught, but occasional density dips in descriptive clusters without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of books-as-plants and unlearned lessons as prisons transforms fantasy tropes through diary's dialects and rescue logic; risk in ink guardians heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
