<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in bitterness-to-hope arc intensifies through embodied arrowhead interactions and shift from capture to witness; interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choices like tending plants revealing values; minor slip in epiphanic summary at "true mission had been to witness" borders unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from arrowhead discovery to celestial patterns; CR closure via arrowhead's luminous mirroring reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of professional isolation; orientation anchored early in first paragraph; one tightening in phone confession to pattern documentation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underground garden vividly sensory (cool air, frostbitten hope scent, bioluminescent mushrooms) and POV-filtered through researcher's priorities; recurring garden and arrowhead constrain observation choices and charge final constellation image; selective details mirror internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering transformations signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations narrowing from dissection to coexistence; agency in persisting undercover forecloses capture path with bitterness cost; pressure coheres but lacks one sharp trade-off to enter 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of untamed harmony emerges organically from cryptid symbiosis and personal metamorphosis; final cosmic joke image offers resonant CR answer reweighting bitterness without moralizing; subtext in arrowhead evolution avoids platitudes through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in observational lyricism (gremlins shimmering, moon-petal flowers); rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure; phone dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing isolation stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in integrated sensory-prose; minor overwriting in repeated "harmony untamed" and "frostbitten hope" echoes purposeful but borders loop in reflective beats; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of evolved cryptids in gravitational garden transforms folklore tropes via cosmic arrowhead logic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens wonder stakes; authentic vision in bitterness-to-hope arc avoids template generality.</comment>
