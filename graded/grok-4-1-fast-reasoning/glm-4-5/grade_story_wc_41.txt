<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prophet's precognitively forgetful trait creates internal conflict shown in clinging to memories versus innate forgetting, culminating in earned commitment at the arch drawing; caretaker briefly applies relational pressure without diluting focus. Minor slip in embodied contradiction during peak hearing lacks a micro-choice under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of fog, driftwood, chalk drawings building to Conceptual Repricing closure: sound emerges then fades, reweighting the quest with felt cost of inevitable slip in "before it slipped away." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via chalk activation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog sculpture garden constrains navigation via obscured paths, driftwood markers, and condensation-shimmering arch, charging final hum resonance; sensory hierarchy (fog ankles, faint sigh through water) filters through prophet's perceptual bias toward echoes. Micro-setting via chalk and arch integrates tactile choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate sound of growing older) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through memory returns on driftwood placement to chalk-induced hum under lens; agency in persistent seeking forecloses forgetting path with legible cost in fleeting commitment. Caretaker coincidence complicates via revelation without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of time's patient melody emerges organically from particulars like videotape hush contrasting arch echoes, reweighted non-literally in final fading hum without moralizing. Subtext in spirals representing changes lingers via ambiguity of capture's permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited POV stable with perceptual signature (echoes, fog ships) modulating rhythmically; brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("I think I know what you mean"), distinct from prophet's textured interior. No head-hopping, elisions purposeful for fogged revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short sensory bursts in peak beats, high density integrates action-image-reflection; exact phrase repetition ("arranging driftwood as directional markers" x3) creates minor template cadence loop dulling propulsion mid-story. No closure harm, metaphors coherent (fog tide, layered sighs).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precognitive forgetfulness, junkyard fog garden, and "sound of growing older" via grandmother's arch transforms aging trope into resonant CR; risk in abstract quest paid off inevitably through chalk spirals and hum.</comment>
