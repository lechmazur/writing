<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as intrepid pilot pursuing resilience source, shown via skilled navigation; interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Revelation via necklace feels earned by prior glow but misses deeper flaw-driven struggle. No embodied emotional contradiction under peak inversion stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: inversion triggers water-flow navigation, necklace glow narrows to First Arch, echoes deliver CR closure with conceptual cost of transformative knowledge. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Arion, Verdantis, Hour of Inversion). One tightening sufficient; persistent inversion constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward rivers constrain choices vividly (narrow passage steer); sensory hierarchy pilot-specific (water flow, rock resonance). Crystals/echoes charge final revelation image. World rules consistent via action (gravity shift, resilient trees).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover resilience) signaled early, tightens via causal inversion dangers narrowing arches/options. Agency in precise steering/endurance forecloses failure path with felt navigation risk/cost. Escalation coherent under causal lens to earned CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resilience/adaptation theme emerges via echoes revealing history and necklace-seed link, reweighting legacy in final smile/homeward turn. Subtext in "whirling silence" modulating wonder/dread; no moralizing, ambiguity in survival's origins lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature pilot-tuned (currents, arches). Voice rhythmic with purposeful "silence" motif modulating intensity; no head-hopping or distance slips. Prose texture distinct via inversion-specific diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion (short inversion tremor sentences to echoing visions); high density integrates setting/action. Minor loop in "whirling silence" x3 purposeful for tone, not obscuring closure; no filter stacks or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity-inversion orchards, water roads, arrow-seed accelerator transforms tropes organically. Necklace reveal inevitable from glow/roots buildup; bold premise commitment heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
