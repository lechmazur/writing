<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via blurring boundaries in greenhouse descent, with micro-choices like pressing card to temple revealing hierarchy of values; minor abstractness in epiphanic whispers dilutes contradiction at peak flood of memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory threads densify toward garden tree touch; on-page CR closure legible in card's dissolution and purpose reconfiguration, with felt cost of "trapped freedom—able to access infinite memories yet bound to never fully live them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald tree and fog-pressed portholes constrain final palm-press choice and charge closure image; selective sensory weave (creaking hull, shimmering leaves) mirrors internal blur without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity) signaled early, deepens via boundary-blurring threads under accumulative lens; one tightening at tree flood forecloses full self-ownership with legible cost in perpetual borrowed lives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant connections emerges organically from thread-weaving, resonating in final chronicler image that reweights isolation as purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (memories as "pieces scattered") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens density without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition (narrative threads); minor paraphrase loops in "blissfully aberrant" phrasing slightly dulls ballroom beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh chimera premise synthesizes memory-horror and identity via ship-garden logic; risk in accumulative fantasy pays off in inevitable tree dissolution.</comment>
