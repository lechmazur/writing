<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in "wavelength align with purpose," shown through sustained preparation amid Korin's doubt, but label-only repetition of "quiet enthusiasm" (three instances) undermines embodied contradiction. Loran's shift to certainty feels earned via coin spiral but lacks deeper internal conflict acting simultaneously. Korin's brief pressure via trembling words adds crucible without voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: static bursts and ritual build density to coin toss closure (RR via spiral realization reconfiguring destruction to rebirth). Orientation anchored early (deck, contracting universe). On-page CR with cost (trembling input of coordinates amid contraction zenith); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambered glow and obsidian slab constrain ritual choices, charging final image ("deck brightened as coins hummed"). Sensory selection (crackles, fracture light) reflects Loran's cosmic focus. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive contraction via interpretation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through distillation to spiral-forming toss narrowing options. Agency in coin release and coordinate input; Korin's doubt complicates pressure. Cost legible in "trembling but determined" fingers charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic alignment over human doubt emerges via spiral image reweighting prophecy (destruction to rebirth) without statement. Resonance from coin memories and static patterns; final hope lingers with ambiguity (order of foretold outcomes). No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward cosmic signals; voice texture cosmic-poetic fits ritual. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Korin voices doubt, Loran reassures). Minor register elevation ("distill the truth") but consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("quiet enthusiasm" x3, "stellar doubt" x3, prophecy echoes) creates paraphrase loops dulling density (-0.8). Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., equipment arrangement beats). Closure image propulsive despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contracting universe ritual with coins/static as interpretive tools; spiral payoff transforms tropes organically. Bold cosmic premise commits fully without retreat. No derivative echoes.</comment>
