<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation roots in peripheral awareness and oracle traits, with contradictory impulses shown in deliberate smudging despite training violation; final journey earned via prior causality. Backstory reflection on Corps recruitment anchors to present fever clarity without flattening pressure. Minor reflection excess tilts present stance effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density from fever obsession to margin smudges revealing map, tightening to Charged Poise closure as Elias steps out under auroras with legible burden cost ("shaking hands"). Orientation anchors early (station at 11,200 feet). Pattern taught implicitly, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting specifics like snow-blown floor and spectrographs constrain choices (altitude amplifies prophecy) and charge final auroral image mirroring internal sorrow. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (peripheral discolorations noticed first). Micro-setting (illustration margins) guides discovery actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth weight) signaled post-fever, escalates accumulatively via smudging density to journey prep narrowing options; agency in "occupying margins" forces trade-off (violate training). Cost felt in "trembling fingers" and "sorrow he now carried as both burden and purpose."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Swaying certainties theme emerges organically from quantum-like observations and margin revelations, reweighted in final image of "crystallized fragment... impossibly light and heavy." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like Alexandrae petals. Invites ambiguity on fate without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in edge-seeing diction ("margins of vision") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from fever clarity to nightfall intensity. Stable close third-person; purposeful lyric compression legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "smudge that hadn't been there yesterday" advances plot/character); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in aurora metaphors purposeful, not muddled in peak prep beat. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle physics with margin revelations and auroral sorrow transforms prophecy trope into "subcutaneous map drawn in sorrow." Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; bold premise commitment heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
