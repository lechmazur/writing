<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers and rituals, with the photo release as earned renunciation showing contradictory love/loss impulses. Diagnostic label-speak like "somatic markers" in the anniversary peak beat slightly abstracts emotion without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from daily rituals to anniversary tightening; orientation anchored early in arboretum/cliff. Closure as Charged Poise via photo release ("watching as it danced downward") reconfigures coexistence of joy/pain with felt cost of letting go.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seaside arboretum/cliff vividly sensory (salty air, crashing waves, cool earth), mirroring internal rebirth and constraining choices like cliff-edge release. Recurrent oyster shell/pearl charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (trauma vs resilience) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via somatic markers on anniversary narrowing to renunciation agency. Visible cost in photo release forecloses clinging path, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience from fragments emerges organically through rituals/images, with final cliff image offering non-literal resonance on optimism/realism. Minor thematic echo in closing lines ("anchored her optimism not despite... but because") borders statement without full subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (body signals, plant coaxing); voice modulates poetically from calm ritual to charged release. Brief child dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing teachable calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "pearl of stillness" explanation and repetitive "quietly" stems ("quietly talented... quietly one") create minor scaffold in early beats. Therapy labels like "somatic markers" add slight artifact density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone survivor as calm gardener transforms trauma trope via pearl/oyster specificity and cliff release. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens resilience stakes organically.</comment>
