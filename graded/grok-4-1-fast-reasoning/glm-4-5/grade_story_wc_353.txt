<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore music drives all actions consistently; embodied emotions peak vividly in "felt the sculptor's hands as if they were her own." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to resonant reconfiguration at closure; tears as "tiny prisms of sound" deliver legible emotional cost on-page. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator recurs to constrain strumming choice and charge final hum; grove's fog and roots mirror inner awakening without overt symbolism. Sensory selection (vibrations, rainbows) reflects symphonic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover music) tightens via emotional deepening in crack-strumming under accumulative lens; tears foreclose emotional numbness with felt cost. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy restoring silence emerges organically from absorption and tears; final "work of redemption" reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like cracks-as-notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with symphonic perceptual signature (harmonies in leaves, sway) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from quiet ritual to charged renewal without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with musical metaphors integrated purposefully; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in opening fog simile doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Silence sculptor reading wood memories transforms fantasy tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
