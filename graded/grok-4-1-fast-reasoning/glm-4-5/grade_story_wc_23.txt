<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Patchwork body scars and grafted skin embody survival, compelling micro-choices like tracing censer edges; rare smile on "weathered lips" earns redemption amid sorrow without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from hydraulics backstory to moon-zenith censer peak; closure Charged Poise in "Welcome home" and ship's blink reconfigures loss with past wrecks' cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains choices, warming/humming/glowing to guide configuration; starlit station and gibbous shadows filter through navigator's intuition, charging ship's horizon approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding reverse migration tightens accumulatively via midnight call and censer peak enabling hidden pathways; quick reconfiguration narrows to instinct with hot bronze as felt physical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Loss-to-hope theme emerges from scarred landmarks and ship returns, reweighted non-literally in final cycle of "departure and return"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in pride/sorrow mix.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "silver thread" and "geography of loss"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates to emotional peak in murmured welcome.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "censer foot" evolutions and "pathways" slightly dull mid-beats; closure image of hot bronze touch propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moon-fluctuating censer talisman and spiritual reverse migration synthesize fresh frame on navigation tropes; patchwork scars transform body-as-map originality into inevitable hope reconfiguration.</comment>
