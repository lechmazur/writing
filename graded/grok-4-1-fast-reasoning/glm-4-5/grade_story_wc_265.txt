<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via gear's warmth guiding choices to nexus realization; interiority concrete in hum vibrations and windsong distinction. Minor slip: epiphanies like "probable miracles" border on unearned without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from gear exam to nexus CR closure ("tone shifted to wonder"); orientation anchored early; one tightening at clearing convergence pays off cost in transformed existence. No causal breaks, but lacks persistent physical constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest sensory-specific (copper needles, solar leaves, silver bark) guides choices via windsong to nexus; recurring trees/gear charge final image of internal rainforests. Details filter through philosopher's bias, mirroring mindscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel translocations) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum crescendo and gear pulse narrowing to integration; agency in following sounds/placing gear forecloses unconscious wandering with felt cost in systematic shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mind-manifested reality emerges organically from particulars (gear integration, windsong language); final image of infinite landscapes reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from gear's transformation bridges dimensions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in metallic/nature synesthesia; rhythmic diction modulates from stillness to symphony cadence. No dialogue; compression purposeful in dream shard transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("small gear" clustered, "wild frontier" reprise) and repetitive stems ("He...") dull mid-section propulsion; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical mindscape and sleep-translocation transforms dream-journey trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens philosophical stakes, inevitable in gear's crux revelation.</comment>
