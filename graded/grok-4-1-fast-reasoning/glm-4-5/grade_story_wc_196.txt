<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to find solace in histories drives consistent micro-choices like dust analysis, with embodied grief ("ache of her grief never quite faded") contradicting her hope. Final kinship earned through prior solitude. Minor slip: Benjamin's brief appearance lacks deeper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure in dialogue ("Then we both found what we were looking for"), reconfiguring solitude with emotional cost legible in "voice cracking slightly." Two shards transition cleanly via "months later"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-setting constrain investigation and charge final image when Benjamin presents matching button. Sensory details (tarnished brass, yellowed papers) selective via POV. File room evolves with lamp adjustment, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering solace tightens accumulatively via file discovery narrowing options to Benjamin link; escalates to call/meeting forcing stance reconfiguration. Agency in dust method; cost felt in persistent grief yielding to kinship. No live antagonist but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of invisible threads/small kindnesses emerges from particulars like winter coat note, reweighted in closure image of bound souls without moralizing. Subtext in silences implies complexity of fractured journeys. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (dust signatures as "unique method"); voice textured, modulating from quiet examination to charged dialogue. Lines like "You found my button" carry subtext of reconnection; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("tactfully hopeful," "accumulated dust patterns" repeated without new pressure); some overwriting in reflective blocks dulls propulsion mid-story. Rhythm varies; closure image clear. Density high overall, no artifacts touch end.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust-pattern forensics transforms archival trope into ingenious causal tool for mystery; button synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in method specificity heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
