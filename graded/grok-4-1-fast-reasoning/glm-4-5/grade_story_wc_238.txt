<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation rooted in past wrong intensifies via ritual micro-choices like scent release and field adjustment, earning imperfect reconciliation; embodied tears and hand tremor under pressure reveal contradiction without labels. Beatrice's forgiveness line forces stance shift with relational cost. Dialogue metaphors distinguish voices, avoiding convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from setup to shimmer, dialogue, energy arc, and fade, culminating in Charged Poise closure via the incomplete sheet left on piano—a resonant reconfiguration reweighting reunion with imperfection cost, legible in "like their reconciliation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic's dusty sheet music and piano constrain ritual shimmer location; perfume's jasmine/regret scent anchors sensory progression, mirroring internal states through dust motes disturbance. Orchard hush outside charges final tremors, evolving with events to pressure fading moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect/apologize) signaled early tightens via apparition gain in substance from proximity and field increase, narrowing to temporary arc bridge; agency in rheostat adjustment forecloses permanence with felt imperfection cost in fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of partial healing emerges organically from perfume unlock, metaphor dialogue, and sheet finale offering non-literal resonance to apology premise without moralizing; final image reweights "incomplete composition" with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward scents/memories; poetic diction and metaphor rhythm modulate effectively in ritual buildup, distinct from Beatrice's grittier ethereal replies pursuing forgiveness goal with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats with varied rhythm, but frequent metaphors like "melodies slept dormant in their paper coffins" border overwriting without muddle; no loops, clear propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise ingeniously synthesizes journalism, electromagnetism, and music for fresh ritual; sheet music payoff transforms ghost reunion into imperfect duet echo, risking bold supernatural physics without gimmick.</comment>
