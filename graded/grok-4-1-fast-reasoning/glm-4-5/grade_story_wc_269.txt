<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of drifting/moored embodied in tapping and final logging choice; realization earned via childhood anchor and data accumulation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure in "the Earth slowly returning... erasing paths"; cost legible in foreclosed human-engineered world, folding atlas seals reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station at continental shelf constrains observation and mirrors internal drift; atlas page as micro-setting charges final fold and journal placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of path-disappearance discovery tightens accumulatively in sleepless pattern-match; agency in patient cross-referencing forecloses denial with felt planetary cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclic reclamation emerges via shifting coastlines and coral hues; final image of tapping amid alarms offers resonant repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in rhythmic oceanic diction and selective data-fish schools; stable limited POV biases toward ancient cycles under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful tapping motif varying rhythm; no loops, propulsion peaks in "digital coastlines bled across paper ones."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban resilience via torn atlas erasing fossil-era paths; risk in quiet CR heightens planetary stakes organically.</comment>
