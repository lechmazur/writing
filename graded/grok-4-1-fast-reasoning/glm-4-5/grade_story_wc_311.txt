<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Naming "Solitude" to the chest ache embodies contradictory loss and release, earning the shift to purpose through prior causal buildup of Elara's memory and atlas tracing; micro-choices like whispering her phrases reveal flawed eternal isolation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as naming density reconfigures fears into defined beauty; closure CR lands on-page in lighter cloak and Elara's fancied whisper, with conceptual cost of crystallized sorrow legible in "legacy not of death but of understanding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracked glass panels and scattered light constrain naming acts and charge final image by crystallizing monsters; brass contraption and dome evolve tactilely, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears tightens accumulatively through successive namings ("Lost Hope," "Elara's Eyes"), forcing emotional trade-off; cost unmistakable in released burden as observatory sighs approval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of naming tames dread emerges organically from sea monsters to personal pains, reweighting premise in final image where fears turn beautiful; resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with skeletal/perceptual bias ("voice like dry leaves") stable in single POV; diction modulates from taunting memories to quiet purpose without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density weaves action, image, reflection without loops; minor repetition of "scattered light" purposeful for pattern but borders template cadence in late beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper naming emotional leviathans like ancient cartographers transforms trope; risk in lyric naming cadence heightens healing stakes organically.</comment>
