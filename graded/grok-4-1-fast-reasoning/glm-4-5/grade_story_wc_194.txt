<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in pursuing truth to end dynasty, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied stress acting simultaneously during crank-turning climax; no flaws complicate choices on-page, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from hum to vibration and compartment opening; closure as CR via parchment reveal reweights dynasty legitimacy with felt historical cost in "weight of the moment."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sepia reading room and golden shadows anchor vividly and constrain gramophone positioning; recurring shadows charge final image as "silent witnesses," mirroring internal revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens via frequency adjustment under Accum lens, narrowing failure option; cost legible in steady heart amid "momentous" discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over force emerges organically through waves and intuition bridge; final image of truth reigning offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature in sepia-toned noticing; rhythmic control modulates but minor register elevation in "ethereal knowledge" jars slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("gramophone crank handle" x6, "eloquently silent" x2, "golden shadows" x4) create synonym churn and template cadence in descriptive beats; purple touches like "long, warm fingers" muddle clarity in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone-standing waves premise transforms trope of hidden truths via scientific intuition; risk in sonic resonance pays off inevitably at compartment reveal.</comment>
