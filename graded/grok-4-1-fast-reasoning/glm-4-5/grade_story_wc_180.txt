<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied emotion peaks poignantly in "quartz eye ache in sympathy with the tears"; feisty trait shown via sore-fingered determination and muttering challenges; minor slip in alternating regret summaries over simultaneous impulses caps below exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising from bag-opening to seed-planting CR ("roots remain" whisper reconfigures vows); cost legible in tears watering seed; shards transition legibly via returns, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard rafters constrain via out-of-reach apples bridged for harvest symbol; charges final seed-plant near carved column; sensory specifics (apple scent, moss pew, golden light) filter through mender priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bloom/footprints/seed discoveries forcing hopeful endurance; agency in persistent returns forecloses isolation path with emotional tear-cost; no agency-driven reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Deciduous vows motif emerges organically from ribbon regrets to seed promise, resonating via CR image; penalized for final-paragraph thematic echo ("Deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists") replacing pure image pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mender-noticing (bent nails repurposed); rhythmic lyricism modulates from feisty mutter to hopeful murmur; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.1<comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("vows withered and dropped") woven into action; minor template repetition ("endearingly feisty" x2, "feisty heart/ nature") dulls slightly (-0.4); propulsion clear, no loops obscuring closure tears.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quartz-mender world, rafter orchard, vow-as-leaf premise transformed via bridge/seed arc; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
