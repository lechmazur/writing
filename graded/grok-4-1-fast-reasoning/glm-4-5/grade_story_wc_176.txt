<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in forgiveness and preservation drives precise reconfiguration; embodied tears freezing on cheeks reveal emotion under pressure. Micro-choices like nimble thread separation earn her keeper role with felt cost of endless work. Minor label-speak in "snowmelt ardor" repetitions slightly abstracts interiority without harming climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from entry to rope reconfiguration, culminating in Charged Poise closure where new card patterns reconfigure her future with conceptual cost of perpetual duty. Orientation anchored early in sanctum entry; linkages like card-to-rope comparison motivate peak illumination. Cost legible in "her own name was transcribed into memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice channels and basin constrain climax convergence, charging final image; aurora curls around rope in pivotal illumination. Sensory hierarchy (frigid bite narrowing to glowing pulse) reflects caster priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks descent to heart cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transcribe names tightens via reconfiguration success forcing keeper stance; density increase under Accumulative lens narrows options to endurance. Agency in "meticulous work" drives illumination reversal; cost felt in tears and isolation as new patterns form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through gentle labor emerges implicitly from rope braids and crystallized names, reweighting forgiveness in final card reprise without moralizing. Subtext in faded wall carvings contrasts successful transcription. Resonant ending answers loss via ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in tactile details like "fingers nimble from wax casting"; diction modulates from chill tension to glowing release. No head-hopping or elision; rhythmic control heightens pulse intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action with sensory propulsion; varied rhythm in reconfiguration beat accelerates tension. Minor overwriting in aurora metaphors slightly muddles peak glow, but no loops or scaffolds obscure causality. Closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax casting, organ card, and rope braids transforms memory preservation trope into tactile ritual; risk in magical payoff feels inevitable from early pattern-matching. Final self-transcription image heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
