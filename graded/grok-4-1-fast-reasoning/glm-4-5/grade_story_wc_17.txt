<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries, embodied in "heart quickened" at diaries; interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding smooth rather than conflicted progression to commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure in final paragraph's realization of walls' dreams as "accumulated consciousness," with conceptual cost of legacy's burden legible; one tightening at film development pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and vines constrain access and mirror rediscovery theme, with rain pattering overhead charging the chamber find; sensory filter (vibrations, cold stone) reflects Elara's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering wall dreams escalates accumulatively via diaries to film glimpse, narrowing to deepened knowledge; cost felt in "weight of this knowledge" and renewed commitment foreclosing prior detachment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of architectural memory emerges organically from sonic/visual bridges, resonant in final image of "adding her own voice to the dreams of walls"; avoids moralizing with earned complexity in legacy's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sound/vibration focus ("subtle resonances"); rhythmic prose modulates from exploratory calm to "trembling hands" intensity without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loop in repeated "Elara realized/began to understand" near end dulls final propulsion slightly; no major artifacts obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo cartography and "walls dream" premise transforms ruin-exploration trope via sonic memory logic; risk in perceptual conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at film's pristine passage reveal.</comment>
