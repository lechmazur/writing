<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's haunting optimism and poetic nature drive consistent micro-choices like whispering to the plate and pocketed needle, embodied in sleepwalking persistence despite exhaustion. Internal conflict subtle in unconscious drive vs daytime weaving life, revealed through village worry. Final endurance earned with visible cost in ongoing journeys, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses in a pivotal on-page beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from plate discovery to sprouting orchids, culminating in RR/Charged Poise closure via enduring labyrinth image ("growing more beautiful with each year") with felt cost (exhaustion, bridged worlds). Orientation anchored early in workshop/harbor. One tightening via sprouting threads narrows to communal reverence; structure fits continuous narrative with smooth time elision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and etched paths constrain sleepwalking choices, charging final pilgrimage image. Sensory details (mist serpents, starlight carvings, orchid glow) filtered through Elara's poetic bias, evolve causally (stitches sprout). Micro-setting via thread/needle integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early via plate dreams; accumulative escalation via sprouting orchids and village discovery tightens to communal bridge, forcing endurance trade-off. Cost legible in daytime exhaustion and ongoing nights. Agency in sleep-sewing forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of art weaving past/present emerges organically from stitching ancestors' paths, resonant in final image of overlapping footsteps without moralizing. Orchid growth reweights ruin/reverence tension. Subtext in dreams vs conscious work invites ambiguity on glory vs restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (paths as dances, threads as prayers) modulates rhythmically with intensity. Lyrical compression taught early via shanties/tapestry, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short stitches in canyon, expansive finale); density high but minor paraphrase loops ("overlapping paths" recurs 4x without full pattern payoff). No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; purposeful lyric repetition fits voice. Slight template cadence in transformation summaries dulls one mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sleep-sewing growth from stone transforms ruin trope via dream-plate logic. Fresh synthesis of wharf-weaving/orchids in canyon feels inevitable, risks bold lyric accumulation without gimmick.</comment>
