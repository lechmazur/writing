<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment drives all choices consistently, culminating in earned stasis against tempting silence. Interiority embodied through "loose grip... anchor, preventing absorption," revealing contradictory impulses acting in the regenerative void. Minor abstractness in emotions slightly limits depth, but micro-choices under pressure feel particular and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from river's rush to silence's void, with clear orientation by para 1. One tightening via anomaly sensed → burrow → chronicle, yielding CR closure: keeper etches secret, foreclosing stasis with felt cost in "loose grip... anchor." No orientation debt; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (ozone/paper smell, solidified honey sink) filters through keeper's loose-reality POV, constraining burrow via swan. Recurring river/refuge charges final image, contrasting silence. Overgrown library subtly mirrors entropy, evolving causally without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chronicle anomaly sans judgment/succumbing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dissonance → burrow encounter, narrowing to endurance choice in void. Agency in notation/return crystallizes stance; cost legible in "frayed edges" healing temptation resisted, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of change vs. stasis emerges organically from river decay/library rot/silence preserve, reweighted in final river return etching "secret... soul and stones." No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, with ambiguity in keeper's anchor lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of bleeding realities and cryptic distortions; diction/rhythm modulates from fluid ("ink on wet parchment") to thick ("solidified honey"). No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct, biased to entropy's moods.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "sunlight fractured... sketched symbols"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("cold silk," "solidified honey") risks coherence in void para, but no loops touch closure; purposeful lyricism fits lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami folds as reality-burrow key transforms trope of hidden knowledge into regenerative void encounter. Risky loose-reality POV heightens stakes without gimmick; final "secret etched... stones" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
