<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in artistic kinship with ghost compels playing the code, earning closure choice; interiority concrete via bodily sensations like cold water in boots. Minor weakness: emotions poetic but occasionally abstract, lacking sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, e.g., no hesitation before playing despite "alien music."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of water/images/music builds to cadence shift at final chord where program dissolves, delivering Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost of bridging worlds legible in peaceful hush. Single scene oriented early; no causality breaks, one tightening via decision to play.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house with ankle-deep water and flickering lanterns constrains choices (wading to piano, light shifting notations) and charges final image (lanterns brighten like stars, reflecting melody). Sensory hierarchy musical/POV-specific; vivid, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel ghost code) signaled early, tightens via agency to play alien notation amid rising pull, reweighting options under Accumulative lens; cost felt in program's dissolution foreclosing liminal trap. Escalation coherent without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of music as wordless bridge across worlds emerges organically from playing and ghost sighting, resonant in final reconfiguration of hush without moralizing. Closing image reweights liminal premise non-literally; complexity in ghost's eternal wait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (musical metaphors like "unstruck chords"); voice lyrical, rhythmic, modulates intensity during play. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible, diction POV-apt without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High info density with propulsion, but overwriting penalty (−0.6): figurative language (shadows dancing, pearls in deep, shimmering stars) in most sentences of playing beat without pattern payoff, risking muddle. Minor paraphrase loops on "music"/"melody"; rhythm varies but elevated diction borders purple in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms haunted opera trope via water-damaged notation as capricious code, synthesized organically with musician's journey; fresh inflection in program's dissolution reweighting silence. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
