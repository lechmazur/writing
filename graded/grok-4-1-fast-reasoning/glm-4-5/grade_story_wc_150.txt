<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's warmly curious trait roots motivation and intensifies through intuitive piecing of sundial fragments, earning his final spiritual shift; embodied tears and trembling hands ground emotion. Internal conflict between diaspora loss and heritage pull shows in micro-choices like offerings and old-tongue speech. Elena applies light secondary pressure via observation, but lacks crucible depth; some epiphanies like "this was homecoming" border unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to sundial discovery, purposeful wandering, and rebuild, tightening to CR closure where light striking sundial reconfigures his interrupted journey with exile's felt cost in "weight of exile lift." Orientation anchors early in orchard and tomb excavation. Single extended scene over days fits scope with one deepening; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard vividly specific with roots "snaking between bones," filtering through Kaelen's reverent POV to constrain choices like tracing bark and fitting pieces intuitively. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile/history amid urgency of excavation. Tree roots embracing base charge final image, mirroring renewal; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore artifact/self amid diaspora loss) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening density of rebuild beats narrowing to faith renewal. Agency in wandering and offerings forecloses exile path with on-page cost in tears and "shift into place." One meaningful cadence shift at sundial completion suffices; cost legible in final shadow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical return/renewal emerges organically from sundial rebuild and roots/bones motif, reweighting interrupted journeys without statement. Final image of light on bird carving offers non-literal resonance tying diaspora to endurance. Subtext in Elena's whisper and Kaelen's reply avoids moralizing; earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in heritage-tinged noticing (e.g., "old tongue... flowing freely"); voice modulates poetically yet consistently. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing Elena's professional tone. No head-hopping; diction reflects returning cultural lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "journey" (e.g., "interrupted journeys," "journey completed," "path rediscovered") and repetitive stems dull density slightly. Figurative density like "roots tightening... sensed renewal" risks overwrite in rebuild beats without harm to closure. High info density integrates setting/action; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora homecoming via intuitive sundial rebuild in bone-orchard transforms tropes organically. Catacomb roots/sundial bird carving offer non-obvious angle on renewal; risk in eerie harmony pays off at closure without gimmick. No derivative echoes; particular voice anchors vision.</comment>
