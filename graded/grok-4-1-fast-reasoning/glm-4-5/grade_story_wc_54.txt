<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving her to bypass circuits with precision; actions align with engineering traits. Interiority concrete in moments like fingering the console, but label-speak ("functionally creative mind," "stoic determination despite the wonder") dilutes embodied contradiction without simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to work to illumination, with causal linkages like sextant find prompting power center move. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final image of sextant inscriptions reconfiguring hope, with felt cost of journeys' weight; orientation anchored early in spaceport after carnival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective via engineering POV: transformers as "sleeping giants," lights "like stars awakening" mirror internal states through action. Terminal constrains choices (dormant systems bypassed) and charges final image; no white-room, spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect for hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hours of precise rerouting culminating in switch-throw hesitation-then-success, narrowing failure option. Agency in her work forces stance crystallization; cost legible in "stoic determination" endurance, charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of hope via engineering/navigation emerges organically from particulars like sextant equations; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting journeys. Minor slip in directness ("equation for hope") borders thematic echo without full subtext layering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in functional metaphors (mapping dots, redirected flows); rhythmic prose modulates from exploration to climax intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density in action-integrated details, varied rhythm aids propulsion; metaphors coherent (stars, sleeping giants). Repetitive phrasing ("maze of intentions" x3, "stoic" variants) creates minor paraphrase loops without obscuring closure, but dulls some momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport post-carnival with brass sextant (out-of-place yet fitting journeys) transforms abandonment trope into hope via engineering; risk in poetic accumulative drive pays off coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
