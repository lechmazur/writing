<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in desperation drives consistent choices to exhibition; interiority concrete via embodied revelations like heart quickening. Minor slip: tidy emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in peak studio beat, but closure change earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of revelations builds from fragment to communal display. On-page CR in final image reconfigures ruins as reborn tradition with felt cost of prior desperation; orientation anchored early in ruins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog and ruins constrain inspiration-seeking and mirror internal fog-to-joy shift; recurring mist motif charges closure image of hope rooting in fog. Sensory selection purposeful, fog tactile and visual throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment reveal to exhibition success; agency in light-painting forecloses isolation with communal cost legibility in visitor transformations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden joy emerging from ruins arises organically via particulars like dancers in fragment; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting fog as preserver without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/color bias; voice textured, modulates poetically under inspiration pressure. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("We remember"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in revelations; minor figurative density in studio beat ("liquid dawn") borders overwriting but purposeful. Slight paraphrase loops on "joy" in ending deduct without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Painting with light" and fresco-as-film transform rediscovery trope into fresh synthesis; risk in light-therapy method heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight for communal rebirth.</comment>
