<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to grasp time's texture drives consistent choices like navigating temporal paths, but internal conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene; merger feels earned yet lacks embodied contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reveries building to DC closure via body disintegration; orientation anchors Elara/garden immediately; single tightening from first fragment encounter to reappearance pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garden's pulsing bridges and hyperbolic shifts constrain navigation and charge final merger image; sensory details like breathing vines filter through designer's bias, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of time's texture signaled early escalates via garden changes and second reverie, forcing agency in activating fragment; deepening reweights options with dissolution cost legible in final disintegration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time as tapestry emerges organically from fading memories and merger, with final image offering resonant CR repricing linear time without moralizing; subtext in garden's evolution avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of geometric/temporal noticing; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, though minor syntactic similarity in reverie beats slightly dulls under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops around "fading photographs" and "quaking reverie" in mid-reverie reduce density; strong propulsion overall, but synonym churn on time texture in sketches beat drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, living garden, and temporal merger transforms maze trope into bold conceptual risk; final disintegration feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
