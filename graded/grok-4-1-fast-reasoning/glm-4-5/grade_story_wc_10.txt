<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in trauma, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; smooth success without embodied struggle or micro-choices under pressure weakens earning of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from fork strike to pattern mapping; closure as CR lands on-page in lighter case and smile, reweighting silence with legible past-trauma cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory vividly amplifies heat patterns, constraining and charging her mapping; final shadows through glass evolve to mirror resilience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early with accumulative deepening via plant responses to vibrations; one tightening in complex resilience patterns, but low opposition leaves cost more conceptual than viscerally narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from heat patterns and rebirth image; final packing reconfigures silence-to-music without moralizing, though repetitive phrasing slightly dulls subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in visualizing vibrations as music; rhythmic modulation supports quiet intensity, marred only by minor repetition bleed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("capsize survivor" x6, "tuning fork case" x7, "winterglass conservatory" x6) create template cadence and redundancy across nearly every paragraph, dulling propulsion and closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent world, heat-mapping emotions, and visual music transforms tropes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight via conservatory vibrations, with bold conceptual risk.</comment>
