<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's curiosity drives micro-choices like following the pulse and connecting the photo to the predator, earning her heroic shift with embodied tension in her tightening fingers on the hearing aid. Internal conflict emerges in doubting the child's tale before realization hits. Secondary girl applies pressure via description matching the photo; backstory anchors without flattening present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pulse because hearing aid -> follow therefore girl -> photo link therefore predator realization -> security call as DC with child saved and hearing aid calming as legible cost in prevented tragedy. Single scene oriented early (atrium at twilight by para 2). Closure reconfigures routine work via photo's fulfilled warning, cost felt in "unspeakable fate" averted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and twilight fog constrain movement and heighten urgency, narrowing to pulses and bench; hearing aid as micro-setting charges choices. Photo recurs to constrain realization and final reframing. Sensory selection (dim blue light, purple cloak) mirrors emotional hush without catalog; spatial choreography clear from atrium to garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace lingering emotions) tightens causally to child protection via photo link, narrowing options to alert security with on-page cost in frantic pulse calming post-resolution. Agency in following trail and calling authorities forecloses predator's path; moral calculus between routine assurance and intervention sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of posthumous protection emerges organically from pulses linking grandma's warning to child's save, resonating in final photo reframe without statement. Subtext in "dead call for reasons" implies vulnerability bridging life/death; ambiguity lingers in device's transformation, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias to emotional pulses; voice texture via rhythmic phrases like "reeling hush" modulates tension. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven (girl's description advances plot); no head-hopping, inference matches Elena's knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pulse strengthened, racing with what felt like warning" advances plot/character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifact in repeated "reeling hush"/"persistently curious" (-0.4), but purposeful for tone; no loops dulling closure image of calmed pulses and reframed photo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes antique hearing aid as soul-tracer linking grandma's photo-captured predator to present save, transforming ghost trope into incidental heroism. Fresh angle on closure via fulfilled warning beyond death; risk in ethereal rules paid off without gimmick.</comment>
