<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in condition drives quest convincingly to earned transcendence, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; diagnostic realization at "paths that choose their walkers... dynamic interplay" borders on unearned epiphany without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising via storm-ritual-dream to CR closure ("boundaries... dissolving... trinity of perception") with legible conceptual cost (quest's half-life toll); single scene fits defaults, dream shard tightens coherently without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (thunder rumble, vines breathing, dust motes in sunlight) mirrors internal chaos-to-clarity; bunker/storm constrain ritual choice and charge final image, satisfying 9+ test without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge past/future to present) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storm catalyst and dream deepening that forecloses isolation path; agency in ritual surrender yields visible cost (life consumed), but no live option explicitly narrowed mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal destiny emerges organically from visions-to-realization arc, resonant in final thought without overt moralizing, but penalized for Thematic Echo as character articulates thesis verbatim ("walkers also choose... true nature of destiny") replacing image pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in chaos, precisely playful tracing); rhythmic prose modulates from ethereal buildup to charged poise, no head-hopping or withholding; elision in dream taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, but minor overwriting in dream beat ("dissolving like sugar in water") mixes metaphors without pattern payoff, docking figurative coherence; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal affliction into storm-dream transcendence transforms fate tropes via specific bunker ritual; risk in nonlinear perception pays off inevitably at CR without gimmickry or derivative hedging.</comment>
