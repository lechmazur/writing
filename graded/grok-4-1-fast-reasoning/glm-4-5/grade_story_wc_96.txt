<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong particular voice and flawed fragmentation drive endurance of mission, with Elias as emotional anchor amid memory gaps. Contradictory impulses more summarized than acting simultaneously in scene, like molting's tradeoffs told via reflection. Final rebuilding stacks as earned stasis, but lacks peak embodied crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tin reveal to seed-scattering, culminating in CR via final image of sealed tin and traced words reweighting anarchy as unchained truth with persistence cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains rebuilding amid decay, with starlight through broken roof mirroring psyche and charging final image. Sensory selection (moonlit whispers, rust) reflects poetic priorities, selective and purposeful. Micro-setting of tin/tools integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resistance via rebuilding signaled early; textural escalation via deepening density (tin contents, seeds among shelves) narrows to endurance with felt cost of fragmentation and entropy. Final continuation forecloses forgetting with legible conceptual price. Agency in scattering/resealing shapes poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges organically from seeds intertwining books, shifting to final resonant image of anarchy quote reweighting premise without moralizing. Luminous fracture motif charges closure but borders overt repetition. Complexity in persistent beauty vs. decay lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (decay as luminous fracture) with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure; POV stable single focalizer. Prose syntax reflects molting mind, purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; purposeful repetition of motifs (tin, Elias) pattern-taught without loops obscuring closure. Minor figurative density in reflective beats but coherent; rhythm varies read-aloud, propelling to final image. No scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet, seed-tin resistance in ruined library transforms vagrant trope into inevitable CR of unchained truth. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
