<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in restoring beauty amid self-aware flaws, with embodied failure on knees driving earned determination; interiority concrete but occasional label-speak like "bitter sweetness filled" slightly abstracts contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from assembly to transformation/fade, delivering on-page CR ("true beauty couldn't be assembled") with legible cost in reversal and illuminating despair; single scene oriented early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrated—palace quaking responds to egg, stalactites anchor while dreaming flight charges final image; mechanical details constrain organic attempt, mirroring internal shift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) tightens via assembly glow-to-fade under Accumulative lens, agency in final piece click forecloses mechanical path with on-page cost (knees, reversal); pressure coheres without excess reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of organic imperfection vs. mechanical precision emerges from failed transformation and egg's faint glow, reweighting premise in non-literal CR; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like "flawed genesis."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in hypothesizing wanderings; rhythmic prose modulates from reverie to intensity, distinct texture in lyrical syntax without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but minor loops ("hypothesizing" x4, "bitter sweet" reprise) and occasional overwriting in transformation spill dull peak slightly; rhythm varies, no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical cavern/prince's organic quest transforms tropes via egg's flawed genesis; risk in suspended palace's awakening heightens stakes, inevitable CR from particulars.</comment>
