<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit tricksters roots consistently in obsession and cautious hope, compelling the interference choice with embodied tension like "hairs on her arms stand." Interiority shows particular struggle via sleep deprivation and faculty dismissal, earning her final documentation. Minor flaw: backstory summaries slightly dilute peak pressure, but no unearned epiphanies touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via preparation→activation→signal stop (DC) with risk cost legible in "rupture her equipment or worse." Orientation anchors early (Elara in radio station at midnight). Two shards cohere (station scene to week-later effects) with legible transition; closure reconfigures options as tricksters may return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully: cramped studio's "vintage equipment" constrains subsonic mods, antenna "reaches toward the heavens" during climax. Sensory details like "air crackled" and "papers sliding" mirror interference, narrowing to immediacies under crisis; charts as micro-setting charge pattern discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop signals amid division) tightens via risky activation narrowing options, driven by agency with felt cost in vibration surge. Escalation causal: recalibration→pulse→stabilization forecloses passive endurance. Week-later healing charges poise without resolving return threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle conquest through division emerges organically via back-channel discovery and community easing, reweighted in "new power plays" realization. Final image of wan smile offers resonant non-literal answer to manipulation premise. No moralizing; irony in Merrick's sheepish return deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (e.g., "whispers in between signals"); diction scientific yet textured, modulating to urgency in climax. No head-hopping or withholding; rhythmic control heightens "blue light pulsed" moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in climax ("everything...seemed to vibrate") propels via varied rhythm; minimal loops. Minor artifacts: repetitive "cautiously hopeful" (twice) and synonym churn around signals cause -0.4; no closure touch. Strong verbs ground action without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic tricksters as perception manipulators via subsonics transforms alien trope through Elara's specific charts/alignment insight. Risk in interference heightens stakes organically; premise commits without retreat, inevitable in hindsight via pattern reveal.</comment>
