<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to repay debt compels pivotal vial release and fade, rooted in consistent traits; actions align with alchemical past. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses in scene, relying on backstory summary for depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to midnight tightening and RR closure via crumbling bead and bloom image; cost legible in dissipation and debt settlement. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse and vigil; backstory interleaves without flattening pressure under BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (bioluminescent petals, frost patterns) constrain ghostly limits and charge final bloom; greenhouse glass and fields mirror internal sanctuary/prison. Recurring vines/roots evolve causally with resonance, filtering through ghost's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seventh-winter vigil to midnight form-strengthening and seed release; agency in tender vial lift forecloses her presence with bead-crumble cost. One decisive deepening narrows to release-or-fade options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent love/debt emerges organically from bead-seed-bloom arc, final spiral center reweighting separation as reunion without moralizing. Mournful elation in ghost's smile offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in post-debt visitations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with ghostly perceptual signature (distorted constellations, pulsing blossoms); rhythmic modulation builds pressure to charged final image. Compression taught early via ephemeral drifts, paid off legibly at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with scene needs; purposeful figurative layering ("lovingly venomous") fits lyric pattern without muddle in peak midnight beat. Minor repetition (lovingly venomous x2) purposeful but borders loop; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical-ghost synthesis transforms tropes via bead-root resonance and pollen preservation; bloom-spiral payoff feels inevitable from prior particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
