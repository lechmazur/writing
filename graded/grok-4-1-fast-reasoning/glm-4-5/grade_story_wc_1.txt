<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in adaptive trait shown via frost method, but reflective summaries like "Lena had always been steadily adaptive" lean label-ish without full embodied contradiction in crisis peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from frost patterns to ledger links; strong CR closure in realization paragraph reweights premise with conceptual cost of purposeful transformation, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon microclimate and frost plates constrain choices (plate placement, chemical solutions) and charge final image of gathered evidence; sensory details selective via art-biased POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover attack motive) signaled early, tightens via frost-spiral mirroring sculpture leading to mineral conspiracy; agency in examination forecloses art-for-art path with resolve cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from frost patterns and ledger to final "artist must become the art"; resonant non-literal answer in resolve image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/refractive patterns; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "quiet canyon under stars" and "steadily adaptive" repeats dull momentum; synonym churn in resonance/solace/silence across reflective beats triggers -1.0 artifact pack without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass art, frost decoding, and mineral smuggling; frost-method turn inevitable from prior particulars, transforms conspiracy trope via artistic ingenuity.</comment>
