<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like fingers tracing the mica pane and contradictory impulses between father's gambling and her theory; motivation to widen perspectives drives the realization of peace. Final endurance of uncertainty feels earned with conceptual cost in the closing pilgrimage image. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("lucid contradictions" catalogued) slightly abstracts peak reflection without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (subway scrawls aligning with her encryption) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where journey becomes pilgrimage with felt cost of reconciled uncertainty. Single scene anchored early (library, midsummer, Moscow); one tightening via tonight's Fibonacci sequence discovery narrows interpretive options. No orientation debt; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica lantern constrains perception (numbers dance differently) and charges final image as she packs it amid clover melancholy. Sensory details (damp shoes, dust-smelling textbooks, rainwashed streets) selective via math-professor bias, integrated into action. Midsummer diminishment mirrors internal theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling gambling fatalism vs structured theory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through scrawl discovery forcing reinterpretation; agency in choosing pilgrimage path forecloses mastery illusion with conceptual cost in peace realization. One deepening reweights uncertainty beautifully. Enters 8+ via live option foreclosure in final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of probability's beautiful uncertainty emerges organically from particulars like eyeliner scrawls and Fibonacci encryption, culminating in non-literal resonant answer: mathematics as "language of hope" reweighting premise. Subtext in silences around father's unlearned wisdom avoids moralizing. Minor abstraction in repeated "lucid contradictions" slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (math patterns in light, subway scrawls); rhythmic control modulates from thrill to melancholy poise. Elevated diction fits professor's voice without register drift. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but paraphrase loops on "lucid contradictions" and "traverse" (e.g., repeated in reflective blocks) create minor redundancy; figurative density (clover melancholy, numbers dancing) coherent but borders overwriting in peak realization beat (−0.6 artifacts). Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively overall. No closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway scrawls as mathematical pilgrimage transforms probability trope into Moscow-specific quest; risk in lyric reflection heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Irreplaceable premise angle on anonymous equations as hope language feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
