<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength: concrete interiority in "ghost with flesh that hungers" and contradictory erasure vs rebuilding impulses drive endurance; earned final renunciation of paper identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density to CR closure ("identity... shared between human hearts"); legible cost in poison label's "fragility," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Containers constrain pilgrimage choices; poison label and tides charge final image, mirroring internal layering with purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity) signaled early, deepens via catalog accumulation under Textural lens; lacks sharp on-page option foreclosure or agency-driven turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonant CR reweights erasure premise through tides/poison image without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("palimpsest," "histories written in water") with rhythmic modulation; stable single-POV, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "layer"/"tides"/"fragments"/"erasure" loops (e.g., adjacent sentences on story collection) create paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion; density strong otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh bureaucratic-ghost premise transformed via oral palimpsest layering in port; bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
