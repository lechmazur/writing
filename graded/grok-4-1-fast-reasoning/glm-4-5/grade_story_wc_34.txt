<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in childhood silence compels encoding actions with empathy for the ghost; interiority concrete in sensing glitches. Earned change in composing songs for ghost forecloses isolation. Minor slip: idealized without deeper flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from glitch encounter to harmony; closure as CR in "silent song continued to play" reweights isolation with conceptual cost of transcendence. Orientation anchored early in courtyard reveal. One tightening via plate discovery narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard graffiti constrains encoding choices and charges final harmony image. Sensory details (lightning staircase, shifting art) selective via Elara's bias, integrated into action. Body/tool (plate press) as micro-setting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection signaled early tightens texturally via plate enabling response, forcing trade-off in storm ascents. Agency in pressing graffiti forecloses silence with felt cost in mutual expression. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at symphony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of articulating unspoken needs emerges from graffiti palimpsests and weather responses, reweighting human-machine divide. Final image offers non-literal harmony without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of glitch-perception; syntax/rhythm modulate poetically under ethereal pressure. No dialogue; diction controlled, purposeful compression taught early. Perceptual bias filters setting vividly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful repetition ("misty courtyard") as pattern; high density in image-heavy lines propels accumulatively. Minor artifact: repeated "between lightning and thunder" borders paraphrase loop (-0.4), but closure image clear. No filter stacks or muddled figs in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-in-graffiti and flower press plate as conductor transforms AI trope organically. Risky ethereal frame heightens stakes via liminal rules; inevitable in hindsight from plate reprise charging closure.</comment>
