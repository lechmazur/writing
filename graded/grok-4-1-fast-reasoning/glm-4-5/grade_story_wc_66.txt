<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in discovery accident, compelling broadcast endurance with risk cost; interiority concrete via ink-stained fingers and practiced radio adjustments. Minimal internal contradiction limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure in dust-dance image with felt risk cost; orientation anchored early in alcove and post-famine context; backstory shards tilt present without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded ember alcove and dust particles constrain hiding and transmission choices while charging final shimmer image; sensory details (radio glow, swirling mist) filtered through POV urgency, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undetectable broadcast) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lyric cloaking and dust method; on-page endurance forecloses detection path with legible danger cost, but external pressure mostly implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of free narratives via dust emerges organically from broadcast and final walking image reweighting silence premise without moralizing; resonance in dust's invisible network avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in musical/copyist details (transcribing notes, humming dust); rhythmic prose modulates calm preparation to whisper broadcast, legible poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops in backstory (story famine silence, dust discovery) and heavy figurative layering (mist swirling, dust dancing) dull peak momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust-as-storyteller synthesis transforms pirate broadcast trope through sound-vibration mechanics and post-famine world; fresh premise follows implications to quiet revolution closure without retreat.</comment>
