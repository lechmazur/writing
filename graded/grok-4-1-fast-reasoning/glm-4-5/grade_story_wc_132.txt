<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to control plants via study intensifies credibly through failed interventions and Marco's doubt, earning her final renunciation with embodied cost ("trembling hands"). Internal conflict shows in dismissing Marco yet growing doubt, but some diagnostic phrasing like "reluctant metamorphosis" abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm observations build density to pattern break (leaf vanishes, shoots emerge), culminating in CR closure when she opens vents and sees explosive growth with destruction cost. Orientation anchors early (nursery, soil, post-thunderstorm). One tightening suffices; no shards or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis after rain recurs to constrain choices (leaf pinned there, shoots emerge, final watching) and charge closure image. Sensory details like "moist soil" and "dripping rainwater" filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring her rigidity vs. flexibility without overt symbolism. Weather causally evolves setting and drives action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. nature's adaptation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed shields and Marco's words to tightening decision ("opened the greenhouse vents"), foreclosing rigid path with visible cost ("destruction in some areas"). Agency in release drives resolution under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of surrender over control emerges organically from plant observations and Elara's arc, with linden leaf/trellis shifting to charge final image. Resists tidy morals via "reluctant" framing, but "circuitously sincere" advice verges on thematic echo in close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (plant-vein tracing, growth charting); voice modulates from rigid ("pinned the leaf... compass and ruler") to intuitive. Sparse dialogue natural—Marco's line carries subtext, Elara's whisper reveals under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" loops thrice as awkward artifact, creating paraphrase churn (Marco, Elara's communication, advice) without payoff; minor template cadence in storm summaries. Rhythms propel otherwise, with vivid density in "bend with the wind but rarely break."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh angle on nature-as-teacher via specific linden anomaly and trellis shoots transforms trope; Elara's reconstruction by release feels earned. Lacks bold risk, settling into familiar epiphany arc.</comment>
