<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits like strategy, compelling choices like decoding under chains; actions align with liberator arc, earning self-freedom with cost. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene—mostly competent execution without deep internal friction. Final escape reveals values hierarchy via seed prioritization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrow leads to bench, decoding opens vault, early voices force escape (DC with urgency cost in partial seed grab). Orientation anchored early (carnival center, chained Elara). Closure legible in back-door slip, reconfiguring stakes to future planting; one tightening via premature crew.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful—dust motes, broken windows, piano bench constrain decoding and flight; sensory narrowed by urgency (clink of chains, voices). Micro-objects like keys and wall mirror internal resistance. Spatial choreography clear through corner-to-wall moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save seeds pre-demolition) signaled early, tightens causally via early crew narrowing escape options with partial haul cost. Agency in decoding/jimmying forecloses chained path. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in flight image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of chained renewal emerges organically from seeds/chains motif shifting to green fields; final laughter image resonates as non-literal answer to drought loss without moralizing. Subtext in ironic carnival prizes vs. real value. Earned via particulars, invites ambiguity on full victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward graceful endurance; voice texture via rhythmic phrasing modulates urgency (e.g., clinking chains). No dialogue; diction character-specific, avoids filters in key beats. Consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive "staggering grace" (4x) creates template cadence loop across beats, dulling propulsion; minor synonym churn in resistance phrasing. Rhythm varies but overwriting in opener (dust motes dancing) pads density. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-vault in carnival refuse transforms dystopia tropes via chained grace and seed liberation; arrow/piano puzzle inflects organically. Risk in poetic tone heightens renewal stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from strategic particulars.</comment>
