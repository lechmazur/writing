<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skeptic's internal conflict between sensory evidence and doubt acts in scene through embodied tastes evolving from metallic skepticism to sweet acceptance; final convergence choice earned by escalating revelations. Storm man's arrival forces relational crucible without status overload. Minor slip in diagnostic "symbiosis" articulation, but cost of lost skepticism visible in transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from ring vibration to aurora flare and hand-touch fusion, culminating in DC (ring dissolves into skin) with legible cost of merged identity. Single scene anchored early on lavender bluff; no orientation debt. Closure reconfigures observer to carrier without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via taste (ozone/copper to honey/ash) filters through skeptic's bias, constraining perception and charging final image of lavender opening. Aurora patterns and forest roots evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (bluff, ring) guides convergence choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (researching weather carriers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via salt-tears cue to storm man's arrival and hand-touch, narrowing skeptic to participant with agency in acceptance. Cost unmistakable in "no longer skeptical" and inherited responsibility. Minor abstractness in forest elections scale, but on-page pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of symbiotic election emerges organically from tastes, ring, and convergence, reweighted in final "walking memories" CR without moralizing. Subtext in "futuristic nostalgia" lingers via particulars; ambiguity in carrier responsibility invites reflection. No Thematic Echo despite explanatory dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via taste diction and luminous skin intensifying; voice modulates from skeptical scan to revelatory fusion. Brief dialogue natural with thunderous subtext advancing revelation; no head-hopping. Elevated register consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats with figurative density ("rustling democratic processes," repeated "terrestrially cosmic") creates minor coherence drag (−0.6); paraphrase loops on tastes/energies dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies but template echoes in sensory stems. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather symbiosis, taste-sensing, and forest elections transforms myth tropes via grounded sensory logic; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes. "Tin compass ring dissolved" turn inevitable from prior vibrations. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
