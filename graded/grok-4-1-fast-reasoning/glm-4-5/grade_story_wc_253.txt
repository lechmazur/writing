<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong motivation to cultivate lightness in grief shown through embodied rituals like whittling expressive faces contrasting blank expression; internal conflict in morally ambiguous performance vs. authenticity earned via daily endurance. Final giving away figures forecloses isolation with social cost. Minor slip: interiority externalized through narration lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of ritual beats building to Charged Poise closure in final equilibrium image; orientation anchored early in farmhouse/turbines. One tightening via intricate whittling drawing people, reweighting isolation. Closure CR legible with conceptual cost of world's hollow interior, crystallized in "remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines and farmhouse constrain choices, moaning as "remade hush" mirroring internal ritual; dried flowers and wood handled tactilely, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy selective via performer's grief-filtered perception. Final turbine witness recharges setting's symbolic pressure without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protesting oblivion via rituals signaled early, escalates accumulatively through whittling progression to communal draw, narrowing to endurance with cost of blank isolation. Agency in persistent narration/micro-choices like touching petals. Cost felt in "layers of expectation" carved away, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of emotional equilibrium emerges organically from carving forbidden faces and post-mandate void, reweighted in final "space between where humanity truly lived." Subtext in brittle petals flaking like "natural death." Resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing, though narrations border explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with theatrical perceptual signature in narrated mundane acts; rhythmic modulation builds ritual cadence under grief pressure. No head-hopping; voice distinct in Shakespearean intonations like "theater of existence." Experimental narration taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines integrating action/sensory/theme, e.g., "curl of wood falling... layers of enforced sincerity." Minor paraphrase loops in repetitive narration stems ("this... is to/my protest"); rhythm varies but elevated diction occasionally drifts in peak ritual beats. No closure harm; propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-mandate world with whittling criminalized emotions transforms tropes into inevitable ritual protest; risk in blank-face authenticity ambiguity heightens stakes. Final CR reconfiguration feels earned from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
