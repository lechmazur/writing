<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in obsession drives consistent micro-choices like phrasebook use and journey, with subtle confidence enabling persistence; interiority particular via scholarly murmurs and dream patterns. Limited internal contradiction or embodied stress during journey flattens peak agency at discovery. Final report-writing endurance earns closure cost against skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening patterns (condensation, falcon, phrasebook) across mosaic shards; orientation anchored early at outpost. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with final condensation image confirming source, legible cost in proof-gathering against disbelief. Journey shards transition legibly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wind whispers, ice shifting, auroras) filter through scholarly POV, mirroring internal states via recurring condensation that charges final image. Rusted outpost and frozen lake pressure isolation, guiding inland trek. Inland convergence integrates as tactile discovery site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern density and journey to discovery tightening. Agency in following falcon and gathering proof forecloses doubt with proof-cost. Minimal reversal but coherent pressure under lens; discovery tests obsession viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of myth-science convergence emerges organically from particulars like inverted deltas and indigenous "water birth," reweighted in final realization of "why humanity needs to seek." Resonant CR ending answers premise non-literally via charged condensation source. Avoids moralizing, embraces ambiguity in skepticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in terrain readings and polyglot precision; voice modulates scholarly-dry to reverent at convergence. Prose rhythm purposeful, diction character-bound. Brief custodian dialogue natural but minimal subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, propulsion aligns with beats. Purposeful "condensation" recurrence avoids loops, charges closure. Minor paraphrase of tranquility (twice) nudges down slightly; no artifacts dull peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydrology myth as "intention" via singular convergence transforms tropes organically. Condensation motif risks bold lyric pattern, heightening stakes without gimmick. Discovery feels inevitable from early patterns.</comment>
