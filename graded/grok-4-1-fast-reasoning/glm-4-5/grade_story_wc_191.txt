<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in protecting lore to prepare throne for heir, embodied in reverent approach and final gestures; interiority concrete but leans summary in "wisely adventurous" backstory without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal peeling or descent beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelations building density to Charged Poise closure (throne awakening with time cost legible in "first hints of mechanical sunrise"); orientation anchored early, causality via flake's responses narrows path without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting specifics like "memory-formatted forests where digital trees whispered nostalgia in binary code" and "crystalline circuitry" constrain choices (treacherous path, trembling ground) and charge final throne image; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway before sunrise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via flake resonance and ground response forcing descent; agency in peeling and gestures forecloses claiming path with felt time cost in narrowing window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honoring past/future through proper power restoration emerges organically via murals and throne projection; final smile offers resonant non-literal answer to worthiness question, reweighting quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lore-filtered details like "binary code that only the trained ear could decipher"; rhythmic diction modulates tension, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful specifics advances momentum; minor overwriting in "earth dissolved politely beneath her feet" quirks tone but no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Retro-futurist synthesis (holographic deserts to solidified light throne) transforms quest trope via specific world logic; fresh "elevator shaft" reweighting of "stairway" feels inevitable from mural buildup.</comment>
