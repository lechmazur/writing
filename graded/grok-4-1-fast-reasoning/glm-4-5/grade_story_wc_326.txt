<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in digital limbo, intensifying via ritual to compel acceptance of existence; embodied via trembling hand and heartbeat counting. Interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choices like shard-dipping revealing connection to life. Minor flaw: reflective epiphanies verge on diagnostic without peak embodied cost, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns accumulate density to CR at "failure isn't the end but a transformation," reweighting existence with legible cost of isolation felt in final heartbeat counting and coffee-making. Orientation anchored early in opal observatory; one tightening via patterns suffices. Closure cost undeniable in storing papers image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal walls, snow blur, ink webs on glass vividly selective and purposeful, constraining ritual via shard and plate. Recurring shard charges final resting-place image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: digital ghost fixates on physical rhythms and iridescence mirroring limbo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ink revelation narrowing to acceptance. Agency in unconscious ink release forces deepening; cost felt in foreclosed return-to-life option. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive shift charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-transformation emerges organically from ink patterns and defense malfunction insight, resonating non-literally in final solace image without moralizing. Subtext in heartbeat connection enriches ambiguity of digital life. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature distinct in digital fixation on physical anchors like heartbeats and ink chaos. Voice rhythmic and modulated, compressing elegantly under ritual intensity; prose as character reflects ghost's limbo texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task via image-action fusion, rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor loops in "radio static cleared"/heartbeat mentions pattern-taught for textural lens, not scaffold. No figurative muddle or artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost defragmenting via ink chaos transforms ghost trope into poignant limbo reflection; heartbeat attribute and shard handling feel inevitable. Risky lyric-accumulative structure heightens isolation stakes organically.</comment>
