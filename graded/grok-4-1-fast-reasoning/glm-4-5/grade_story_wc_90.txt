<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's pacifism and shadow work integration show contradictory impulses acting in the stitching scene, earning the transcendence choice; embodied lightness from hope reveals character under pressure. Minor therapy-speak in "inner reconciliation" slightly abstracts emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from preparation to rift widening; on-page closure via final stitch opens dimension with ship's dissolution as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in spaceship meditation chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship constrains via groaning bulkheads and ghosts echoing isolation, charging final dissolution image; sensory hum of tear and rift pulses mirror internal states through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dimensional stitching signaled early, tightens accumulatively as concentration risks void trap, narrowing to lightness-enabled crossing with ship-loss cost legible in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of compassion's triumph emerges via tears motif shifting from sorrow to connection, resonant in final chorus welcome reweighting humanity's extinction without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward shimmers and tears sustains single POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in stitching beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "recycled spaceship" (repeated 7x without new pressure) and "steadfast pacifist" create template cadence, dulling propulsion in opening third; rhythm varies but synonym churn on tears/sorrow drags density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stitching dimensions with tear-needle and happiness-lightness transforms isolation trope; risk in ghostly lyricism heightens transcendence stakes organically.</comment>
