<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to defy fate is consistently rooted in her counter-clockwise trait, shown through precise micro-choices like tracing the yoyo's contours and twisting against its spin; interiority feels embodied in "bleak exhilaration surged through her veins." Minor weakness in mild internal conflict—warnings of sanity are noted but not shown acting simultaneously as contradictory impulses during the climax twist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: actions like tool use and yoyo twist directly cause stone shift and radiance seep ("As she twisted it... something within... shifted"); on-page CR closure in "Everything shifted—not just the light or the tide, but the very fabric," with felt conceptual cost of altered reality as tide returns. Orientation anchored early in shore/lighthouse/stone setup; single scene tightens meaningfully at tailored-yoyo realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rocky shore, cold seeping water, and pulsing stone constrain choices via tide window, charging final image as "first wave... approached"; lighthouse beam interacts purposefully with glow. Sensory hierarchy fits inventive POV (focus on mechanisms over weather); no white-room—tactile, lived-in navigation of stone/yoyo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve yoyo before tide) signaled early, escalates causally via resistance to realization to click ("The yoyo's mechanism resisted... final mechanism clicked"), narrowing options with tide pressure; agency in reverse-engineering forecloses failure path. Cost legible in narrow window and world-shift risk, though physical price remains oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time as choice emerges organically from particulars like backward clocks mirroring yoyo twist, reweighted in CR ending ("world revealed itself... as fluid potential"); no moralizing, ambiguity in "ancient or newly born" light invites reflection. Final smile offers non-literal answer to fate-defiance without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mechanistic noticing: "neatly inventive adjustments... patterns that others might have missed"); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate ("fingers... traced") to peak vibration ("resonated... through time itself"). No dialogue; purposeful diction like "slow exhale of low tide" sustains texture without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cold water that seeped through her trousers" advances setting/embodiment/action); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor artifacts: "bleak exhilaration" reprises twice without strong pattern payoff, and minor synonym churn in "defied... defiance" loops near climax (−0.4 applied here only); no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes clocks/yoyo/stone into fresh inevitability: backward nature anticipates puzzle ("tailored specifically to her counter-clockwise nature"); risk in reality-alteration pays off without gimmick. Transformation of tropes (ancient artifact) through inventive POV and conceptual shift feels organic and memorable.</comment>
