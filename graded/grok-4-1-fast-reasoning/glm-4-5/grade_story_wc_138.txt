<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority in boredom evaporating to intrigue, embodied via amulet hum and field tendrils; final guardian shift earned through Elara revelation without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses (monotony vs. curiosity) act in discovery beat. Minor flaw: motivation shift to Elara feels slightly retrospective rather than fully conflicted on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds: amulet discovery → storm linkage → portal step as CR closure with cost (escondite collapses, "forever changed" reconfiguration). Orientation anchored early in escondite/solar storm. One tightening via Elara's amulet realization narrows to personal quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prismatic walls shift from distraction to dimensional windows, constraining manipulation via storm's tendrils; body/amulet as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (magnetic pulses felt dimensionally) reflects POV bias. Final collapse charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end boredom → restore balance) signaled early, deepens via Elara link forcing portal choice with trade-off (escondite loss). Agency in field manipulation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in acceptance of "continuation." No reversal overload; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (immortality post-goodbye) emerges via particulars: amulet fracture → essence message reweights premise in final image without stating moral. Resonance from spatial chaos contrasting personal acceptance. Avoids platitudes through Elara's sacrifice cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (dimensional awareness colors all notice); diction modulates from languid ("taffy") to charged ("hushed thunder"). No head-hopping; elision of Elara backstory anchors to present cue. Rhythmic control builds to portal step.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., walls as "windows showing...upheaval" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm suits Accumulative build. Minor overwrite in metaphors ("taffy," "dying rainbow") slightly muddles early pressure beat, no loops or scaffolds touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal ennui with dimensional sci-fantasy via magnetic-amulet mechanics; trope of lost love transformed through guardian duty. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes without gimmick. Portal emergence as "space between dimensions" feels inevitable.</comment>
