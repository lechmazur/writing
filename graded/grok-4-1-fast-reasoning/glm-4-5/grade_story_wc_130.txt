<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to quantify emotion via ritual is concrete and intensifies through contained optimism, with contradictory impulses (hope's danger) acting in the vision beat; micro-choices in tracing patterns reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to pattern shift and mentor vision (Charged Poise RR) with felt cost of hope's peril; orientation anchors early in cavern/orchard/ritual setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard, stalactites, mosaic stone, and glass eyes constrain ritual choices and charge final reconfiguration image, with sensory details (dripping rhythm slowing) mirroring emotional transformation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mentor recovery via emotion math) signaled early tightens via pattern shift and vision under Accum lens, forcing renewed purpose with legible cost of contained optimism; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as transformative relations emerges organically from ritual equations, orchard drops, and final pattern/mentor image reweighting loss-connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns as emotion bridges) and rhythmic modulation during ritual intensification; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("orchard grew silent beneath the moon" x2, "buried optimism" x2, chipped patterns churn) and minor synonym redundancy dull propulsion in late beats (−1.2 total); rhythm varies but overwriting strains peak ritual density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-math ritual in bioluminescent cavern with glass eyes/mosaic transforms loss trope via inventive pattern-shifting closure; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
