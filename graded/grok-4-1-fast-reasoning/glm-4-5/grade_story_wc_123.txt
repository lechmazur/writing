<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's meticulous observation and trembling fingers under adrenaline embody credible curiosity and internal tension effectively; micro-choices like lateral movement reveal values. Final decision to release the pigeon earns change through prior data-gathering causality. Minor label-speak ("nurture integrity in solitude") slightly abstracts peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: followed home → finds tube → reads conspiracy → subverts with own message → releases pigeon as DC with risk cost legible in "burdened...by the responsibility." Orientation anchors immediately in courtyard/dusk. Single scene tightens perfectly to closure without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard's fountain masks sounds, cobblestones hide tube, dusk shadows constrain lateral path—setting guides choices holistically. Recorder's perceptual hierarchy (pigeon feathers, wax) charges final release. Micro-setting as pivotal constraint elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose manipulation vs. surveillance risk) signals early via "being followed"; message confirms, narrowing to subversion agency. Release forecloses safety with felt exposure cost under causal lens. No major reversals needed; one tightening suffices cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subversion theme emerges via particulars: artificial storms to engineered truth via pigeon. Final image reconfigures "layered tranquility" from veneer to "promise of the calm" without moralizing. Pigeon reprise answers conspiracy question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with recorder's selective noticing (feathers, wax, stars) creates distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates from wary tension to poised release. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice confident in focalizer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("quiet courtyard," "layered tranquility," "progressing laterally") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across beats, dulling density (−1.0). Strong verbs and sensory integration propel otherwise. Artifacts do not obscure closure but drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silver pigeon's subversion twist transforms quarantine trope organically, growing from storm data to ironic justice. Weather manipulation premise synthesized freshly with lived detail. Risky solo-agency closure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
