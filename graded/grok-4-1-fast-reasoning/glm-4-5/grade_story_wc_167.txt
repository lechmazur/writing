<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied perceptions like calloused hands and dream-weight eyes, but epiphany at pond ("noctilucent reckoning came") borders on unearned without deeper contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from routine to pond ripples' CR closure; cost legible in reweighted purpose ("work... never been about the glass"); orientation anchored early in workshop/dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dew-crystal spiderwebs, shimmering bay) filter through glazier bias and constrain realization at shore/pond; pond boulders charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane) signaled early, deepens via inexplicable pull and stone-throw agency to foreclose prior certainties; cost felt in heart-clearing resolve, but pressure remains quiet without sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of seeing hidden value emerges organically from glass/prism/ripples, but final paragraph's direct statements ("value wasn't found only in the extraordinary") trigger thematic echo penalty, replacing image resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (naming unnamed colors, reading between grains/waves); rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but paraphrase loops in reflections ("patterns... connections," "seeing—truly seeing") and minor synonym churn (light/clarity) dull peak pond beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier profession as medium for metaphysical seeing transforms mundane craft trope; pond-stone realization inflects prior motifs inevitably, risking lyric boldness without gimmick.</comment>
