<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation from scent loss to clock repair drives micro-choices like tracing the screw's edges, earning her final warmth; contradictory impulses subtle but embodied in her shift. Lena applies relational pressure, forcing Elara's story-sharing. Final heart-lightening feels earned without epiphany overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from Elara's solitude to shared stories, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "their fingers touching briefly" with legible emotional cost of past loss reconfigured. Single scene oriented early; one tightening via Lena's return narrows to mutual recognition. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water clocks as micro-setting constrain and charge closure via "gentle drips... bridging their different experiences," mirroring internal states tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (drips, fog, brass) reflects Elara's tactile bias post-smell loss. Final image recharges fog and rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveiling miracles amid loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through conversation to "we both help people transition," forcing stance crystallization with felt warmth cost. Gentle pressure coheres but lacks sharp reversal; agency in sharing earns reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-renewal emerges organically from screw as bridge and clock rhythm; final image "even in loss, new connections" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and touches invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tactile "fingers tracing"; voice rhythmic, modulating to hushed intensity. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You can tell?"), distinguishes voices without convergence. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in screw/clock descriptions ("worn surface... helped bring life") dull density slightly; figurative density high but coherent without muddle. Strong propulsion overall, varied rhythm; artifacts don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-loss to tactile "reading" clocks/screw transforms disability trope via specific midwife heirloom bridge. Risk in poetic accumulative closure heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
