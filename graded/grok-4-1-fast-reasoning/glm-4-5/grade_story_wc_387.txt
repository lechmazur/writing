<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Solitary philosopher's traits consistent and embodied in net-mending rituals and pattern-seeing, with motivation to appreciate effort earning endurance in isolation. Interiority concrete via hands, whisk, and nets, revealing worldview without stock epiphanies. Lacks contradictory impulses acting in high-pressure micro-choices, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds from routines to pilgrimage and philosophical crystallization. Orientation anchored early in cabin/river/net-mender. Closure via Conceptual Repricing in final tea/nets image reweights patterns as internalized with ephemeral cost legible ("moon paths would fade... now part of him").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (gnarled hands on hemp, firefly Morse, moss whispers) filter through philosopher's pattern bias, guiding choices like whistling on moon paths. Recurring nets/whisk constrain contemplation and charge final image of "hexagonal openings" mirroring imperfections. Purposeful integration avoids tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort signaled early, with accumulative deepening via pilgrimage observations narrowing to wisdom of imperfections. No reversal or tightening forecloses live options; pressure remains philosophical/textural without agency-driven trade-off or felt price beyond abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of invisible connections emerges organically from nets/fireflies/paths, resonating in final image without overt moralizing. "Highest form of wisdom: to notice the unnoticeable" borders thematic echo, flattening nuance. Emerges from particulars, inviting reflection on ephemerality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (geometry of nets, stars, fireflies); diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating somber lyricism. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies (short sentences in rituals, flowing descriptions elsewhere). Minor paraphrase loops on "patterns" and philosophy ("hidden effort" restated) dull select beats, but no closure touch or heavy artifacts. Varied syntax, strong verbs enhance ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net geometry as universal metaphor, moon paths/firefly Morse as hidden order transforms hermit trope into demure pilgrimage. Risks lyric philosophy without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via whisk/nets reprise. Q4 limits high-band entry.</comment>
