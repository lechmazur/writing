<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak in tears and throat pressure during visions, earning the surrender at climax; contradictory awe/dread drives micro-choices like embracing confusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions and wind tightens to CR closure ("lost time accumulates... in the spaces between moments") with surrender cost legible in glade's dissolution; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Saucer crack and glade's mist/shimmer constrain ritual choices and charge final pulse/image; sensory selection (porcelain touch, ink drinking moonlight) reflects perplexed urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate lost time) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via choking visions narrowing to acceptance; agency in tracing forecloses control with felt cost in scattered cards and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of presence vs. loss emerges via saucer visions and final image, but "cloudbound repentance" and "this was her repentance" in closing lines echo thesis overtly, diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (perplexity in mist/clouds) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Refrain motifs ("choking beauty") teach pattern for accumulative payoff without loop drag; high density propels to closure, varied syntax matches emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, motherhood, and time's texture transforms tropes; glade ritual's reconfiguration feels inevitable from onyx-ink particulars.</comment>
