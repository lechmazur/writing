<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via charcoal-stained fingers and mnemonic replay of the map; contradictory sorrow/determination acts in the cave-painting beat. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "blessing and curse" slightly abstracts emotion without full embodiment. Final reclamation choice earned by prior suppression and discovery cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density and image buildup (studio discovery to cave glow) tightens to RR closure (portrait shimmer reconfigures creativity with felt sorrow-cost). Orientation anchored early (artist descending to cave). One tightening via painting reveal suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave and charcoal fingers as micro-setting constrain choice (glow reveals blues, forms easel) and charge final image. Sensory glow/veins filter through POV urgency; purposeful, not catalog. Subtly mirrors internal reclamation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim creativity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discovery-to-cave deepening that narrows to rectify-or-not choice. Agency in tracing panel/placing canvas; cost legible in "determination replacing sorrow." One tightening forecloses suppression path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed calling-to-reclamation emerges via particulars (hidden portrait, mnemonic curse); final image (shimmering echo) resonates non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in ghostly marks and luminous regret; invites ambiguity on loss/discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (charcoal smudges, crystal glow bias); rhythmic lyric texture modulates to charged poise at end. Cleaning woman's dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot. No head-hopping; elision of past taught early, paid in present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering (e.g., "auroral sorrow," "broken combination lock") risks overwrite in peak painting beat, docking for coherence without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops on "charcoal fingers" and "inescapable calling" (-0.4); propulsion strong overall, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh crystal cave/mnemonic artist synthesis transforms rediscovery trope via specific glow-reveal and lock metaphor; risk in lyric density heightens stakes. Non-obvious final shimmer as mirror/window feels inevitable from priors.</comment>
