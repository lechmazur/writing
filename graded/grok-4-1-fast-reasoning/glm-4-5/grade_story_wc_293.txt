<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in brother's rejection emerges late via summary ("ashes of 'never'"), lacking embodied micro-choices under pressure; interiority concrete but declarative epiphanies like "understood his motivation" feel unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from vanishing to scaffold mapping; on-page Charged Poise closure as fiddler ascends with vow, cost legible in shift from disbelief to lantern-lit pursuit; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters and glass flake constrain path choice and charge final image; sensory details (pine scent, warming flake) selective via observant POV, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pursuing amnesty tightens accumulatively via flake projection and intensifying flutters; agency in stepping onto scaffold forecloses doubt with felt cost of embracing unknown, though stakes lean abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges organically from vanishing, bridge imagery, and vow, with subtext in repeated transformations; final image reconfigures "never" without moralizing, though "pixelated amnesty" borders overt labeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature ("dynamically observant"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity effectively in lyric mode; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "scaffold wrap flutters" (6+ instances) and paraphrase loops on disbelief/transformation create synonym churn dulling closure image; dense figuratives overwrought in peaks without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pixelated vanishing, projecting flake, and fluttering maps transforms magical realism tropes into organic ascent; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
