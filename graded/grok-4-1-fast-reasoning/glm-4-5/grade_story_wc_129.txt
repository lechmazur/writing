<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's rootless yearning drives proposal and etching, embodied in reed-tending; secondary characters pressure via shared exhaustion, but lack voice-distinct flaws. Final dedication earns change with isolation cost. Bold sympathy enables group formation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solitude to sigil discovery/etching as RR closure, cost in deepened ache legible at "dissolving the ache into pure luminescent warmth." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via path find.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crater's treacherous walls and luminescent fluid constrain rappels/pulleys, charging arbor's final pulse; sensory filter (glow mirroring ache) purposeful, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Belonging stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via quest exhaustion to realization narrowing isolation options; agency in proposing/searching, cost felt in "sharpened ache" before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sigil as land-woven unity reconfigures kinship from personal craft, resonant via arbor etch without moral state; theme emerges organically from particulars, ambiguity in "mythical" tag resolved concretely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in Elara's POV, perceptual bias in weaving/light metaphors distinct; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative stacks ("shimmering crater’s edge," repeated glows) slightly muddle search beats; no loops, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alien orchard-crater and tag-as-ancestral sigil synthesize belonging freshly; risks poetic density pay off in charged etch without gimmick.</comment>
