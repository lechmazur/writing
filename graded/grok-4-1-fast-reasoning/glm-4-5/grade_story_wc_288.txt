<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to translate isolation into independence intensifies credibly through embodied rawness of awakenings, but diagnostic phrasing like "struggling to walk the line between who she had been and who she must become" borders on unearned epiphany, softening contradictory impulses in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from memories to hum's resonance; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in final image of internal clock harmonizing with stones, cost legible in "crack filled with the golden light of acceptance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's breathing shelves and drifting books vividly constrain navigation and mirror internal tides; sundial and reflective walls charge final image, with hum evolving to guide coexistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of independence tightens accumulatively via awakening fragility to hand-on-wall choice, narrowing isolation with felt cost of mosaic acceptance; agency in coexistence forecloses control path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coexistence over dominion emerges organically from tides, hum, and memories; final sundial image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, ancient phrasing like "books flowing in and out on currents of knowledge"; diction modulates beautifully under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel forward, but minor paraphrase loops around "awakenings" and "tides" (e.g., repeated fragility motifs) slightly dull select beats without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation stream in breathing library transforms extinction trope; risk in hum-as-method heightens stakes, culminating in inevitable mosaic independence image.</comment>
