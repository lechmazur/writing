<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as guardian of lost wonders, with actions aligning via precise camera adjustments and vigilance; embodied emotions in heart swelling and steady hand under pressure. Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on labels like "dawnlit melancholy" without deeper scene friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from timing device to firefly dance and fade; orientation anchored early (Elena on lunar summit pre-dawn). Closure as Charged Poise: mission complete with fireflies' disintegration as felt cost in final images, reconfiguring melancholy to purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid and selective (breathing in helmet, blue lights swirling); moonlit summit as micro-setting constrains vantage for photography and charges final sunlit transformation image. POV bias shapes notice of craters and fireflies, mirroring internal anticipation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph fireflies before extinction) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chemical timer progression and dawn approach forcing endurance. Escalation driven by Elena's agency in outlasting night; cost legible in disintegrating fireflies and era's end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of progress's sacrificial losses emerges organically from documentation act and final photos preserving beauty; resonant non-literal answer in melancholy lifting to purpose without moralizing. Subtext in firefly dance contrasts mining bustle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent perceptual signature (curious notice of details); voice texture poetic via rhythmic phrases like "dawning hush" modulating intensity. No head-hopping or leakage; diction fits inspector's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("dawning hush," "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain," "dawnlit melancholy") create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling propulsion; template cadence in sequential adjustments and scans. Density solid otherwise, with varied rhythm in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi extinction vigil with chemical timer relic transforms space-age tropes; lunar fireflies and sand-grain device offer non-obvious ingenuity tied to closure image.</comment>
