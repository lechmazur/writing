<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied purpose in knotting ritual flush across cheeks; motivation to honor histories compels micro-choices like attaching wing with felt cost of transience. Lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning harmonious without much struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to knotting, wing attachment, monarch dip, and final heartbeat shift as Charged Poise RR with legible cost of dissolution by dawn. Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in grotto perch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting of floating moss/orchids constrains transient signals and charges final starlit sway; sensory filter (cloudlight, mist) reflects esoteric priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring last monarch tightens accumulatively via dusk urgency and wing beacon drawing acknowledgment; agency in ritual forecloses ignorance path with transience cost felt in dissolving structures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile remembrance emerges organically from monarch's solitude and knotted generations; final hand-to-heart reconfigures loss as eternal rhythm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of patterns (cadence, tapestry); rhythmic prose modulates from observational to purposeful in dusk knotting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (iridescent wing in amber to beacon); minor paraphrase loops on "interrupted cadence" but purposeful under textural lens, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-elegy in cloud-grotto ritual transforms migration trope via esoteric signals; risk of lyric poise heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
