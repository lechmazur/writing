<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through Ethan's focused playing, rooted in mentor's death; interior nostalgia embodied in mournful tune. Internal conflict subtle—nostalgia vs. determination—but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak play. Final endurance of burden's release earned with felt cost in closing realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anticipation to urgent notes clashing with prophecy, culminating in CR closure ("stillness that meant the prophecy had been hushed") with nostalgic cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (Ethan trekking to prism atrium). One tightening via urgent notes suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains choice via perfect acoustics for vibration cancellation, charging final stillness; dewdrops recur, mirroring hush and evolution. Sensory hierarchy (light/sound/mist) filtered through saxophonist's priorities, integrated into action. Final image reweights mist-veiled atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening musical battle ("prophecy thrumming against his music"). Agency in crafting inverse peaks with on-page cost (burden's nostalgic release). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence/music hushing prophecy emerges organically from performance particulars, reweighted in final realization ("chosen...understood both...music and...silence"). Subtext in negative space whispers; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing. Nostalgia layers complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (musical negative space, misty prisms); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to urgent ("notes became more urgent"). No head-hopping or elision; diction controlled, biased to saxophonist's hush-attuned noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action, but repetitive phrasing ("dewdrops formed," "eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid") creates minor synonym churn and template cadence in mid-section, dulling propulsion without pattern payoff. Closure image clear; rhythm varies under peak stress. No loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical inverse to cancel prophecy transforms trope via negative space vibration; risk in abstract stakes paid via textured performance. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars; bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
