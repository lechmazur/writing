<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority veers into diagnostic philosophizing like "sculpting patience from impatience" without simultaneous impulses acting in scene. No credible endurance with visible cost beyond declarative satisfaction. Final charting feels low-stakes and unearned by prior scene tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from observations to viaduct hum as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure at "mapper smiled... dawn began to creep" with conceptual cost of realignment legible. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early. Minor deduction for oblique cost without decisive on-page price in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: breath fogging glass, lake cracking like thunder, basalt floors humming constrain observation and charge final thaw image. POV bias toward celestial priorities sharpens focus without tourist catalog. Environment guides choices via window/moon view.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (patient revolution via confirmation) signaled early but escalation minimal—one hum tightening without narrowing live options or visceral trade-off. Abstract community impatience lacks on-page test; agency in charting endures but cost remains conceptual, not unmistakably priced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience vs. haste emerges organically from moon tracking and hum, resonating in final dawn image without overt moral. Some telling edges toward echo in "true revolution—not an overturning but a realignment." Complexity lingers in generational shift ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: celestial/magnetic bias in noticing "invisible lines of energy." Lyrical rhythm modulates effectively; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice consistent, prose as character reflects restrained vigilance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "patient revolution" and "softly purposeful" across reflections create minor redundancy (−0.4); figurative density (e.g., "flame dancing with restrained wildness") purposeful but borders overwriting in setup. Strong propulsion overall, varied rhythm, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial mapping, magnetic anomaly, and quiet revolution transforms vigilance trope into inevitable conceptual payoff. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via subtle energies without gimmickry. Irreplaceable viaduct-moon alignment drives ingenuity.</comment>
