<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in immersion drift from intention to memory/prophecy, earning duty evolution with embodied cost in "velvet disquiet"; interiority particular via dead languages and family legacy. Flawless single-POV execution under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via immersion-to-prophecy deepening; CR closure lands in evolved duty ("archaeologist of human emotion") with conceptual cost of city's foretold fall legible in final candle image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no shards, seamless causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard atop skyscraper constrains via leaning trees and pavilion archive, charging final resolve; sensory filter (rustling louder in silence, cool wax) mirrors emotional patterns. Recurrent foghorn silence and unripened fruit evolve with prophecy, biasing perception perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive emotions) deepens accumulatively via accidental prophecy, narrowing to preservation before downfall; agency in immersion forces stance shift with felt cost in heart racing and shadows. Minor abstractness in stakes scale slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unintended past-future links emerges via prophecy, reweighted non-literally in wax-as-oracle image answering preservation imperative; subtext in field trip seed enriches without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from Elias's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (languages "whisper," grooves "hold fragments") modulates rhythmically under stress; diction controlled, biased to emotional essences. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated specifics (e.g., "foghorn fell silent an hour ago"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts, though minor metaphor density in prophecy beat borders overwriting without muddling closure. Read-aloud ear excels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath scribe + wax shaving prophecy via memory transforms tropes organically; risk in emotional-archaeology pivot feels inevitable, heightened by skyscraper orchard. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
