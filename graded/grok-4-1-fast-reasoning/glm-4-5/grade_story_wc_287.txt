<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in grandmother's tool and garden drives higher-stakes choice to boat out; embodied emotion in petal drop and harbor gaze. Internal conflict mild, leans toward summary of wistful pragmatism over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from garden to alcove reflection, holding to Charged Poise closure where purpose crystallizes with time cost ("hours passed"). Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening via Jim's revelation tightens stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bitting gauge and alcove rock constrain reflection choice, charging final glowing image; sensory details (scent of earth, shimmering mercury) filtered through gardener's priorities evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reflect light signaled early, deepened accumulatively by Jim encounter narrowing to collaborative endurance; cost legible in hours/effort foreclosing return, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited light-in-darkness emerges via tool/images, resonant in alcove glow reweighting pragmatism without moral; subtext in Jim's recognition avoids tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (garden/herb focus); dialogue natural/subtextual ("The garden needs light"), distinguishing voices idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (oar cadence echoes prose); minor loops in "quivering hush"/light motifs dull propulsion slightly, but density high without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lock tool as moonlight reflector transforms inheritance trope organically; risk in quiet boating quest heightens vulnerability stakes.</comment>
