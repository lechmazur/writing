<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in chronological homesickness drives memory-mapping with embodied exhaustion, but interiority leans abstract with label-speak like "chronologically homesick" repeated without deepening contradictory impulses in peak recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories densify to crescendo; on-page Charged Poise closure in "symphony... existed beyond sound" with exhaustion cost legible; orientation anchors early in spire/lake/dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and mirrored horizon constrain focus and charge final image, mirroring internal spiral; selective sensory details like refracted rainbows integrate purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conduct symphony tightens via accumulating vibrations and looming exhaustion, forcing forehead placement; agency in memory-mapping yields felt cost at collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of temporal belonging emerges organically from memory-symphony fusion; final "time had folded" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in musicalized memories; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to crescendo without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel, but minor paraphrase loops in memory lists ("sound of... pattern of... warmth of") and repeated "upturned hush" dull peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writer as memory-conductor in spire-shell-lake frame transforms homesickness trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable at "time had folded."</comment>
