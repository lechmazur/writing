<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied reverence for the cloth revealing roadie past under appraisal pressure; internal conflict between chaos and quiet life layers contradictions realistically. Backstory reflections anchor to present cues like the cloth weave, tilting his inspection micro-choice. Final glimmer of passion earns change via causal buildup of details matching Marshall, foreclosing shame with felt cost of losses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from uncertain inspection to pattern recognition and authentication cadence shift. Single continuous scene with clear early orientation (quarry trailer, Marcus, cloth). Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page in sealing the bag, reconfiguring purpose with undeniable emotional cost legible in "glimmer of passion" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (dust, struggling AC, quarry hole view) filters through Marcus's loss-biased POV, mirroring internal emptiness; hole view charges final image of "echo valley." Magnifying glass and desk constrain inspection choice tactilely. Quarry trailer micro-setting guides isolation and reflection without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming purpose via cloth appraisal) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through weave/thread details narrowing uncertainty to confident ID. Protagonist agency in inspection/authenticates forecloses shame path with felt cost in "close to nothing, but...everything" admission to foreman. Pressure coheres internally without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of purpose after loss emerges organically from cloth bridging past applause/chaos to present quiet knowledge, without statement. Final sealing image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting losses via glimmer without moralizing. Subtext in confidently uncertain expertise layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with roadie-specific perceptual signature (amp fabrics as treasures, festival murmurs). Prose rhythm modulates from reflective to precise in inspection; brief foreman dialogue natural, goal-driven (value query advances appraisal). No head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; syntax varies for rhythm matching introspection to revelation. Minor paraphrase loops in loss reflections ("hollowed out...empty spaces") but no closure touch or heavy artifacts. Clean grammar, strong verbs in key beats like "wrested a magnifying glass."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie-appraiser in quarry desolation transforms loss trope via cloth's specific '72 Marshall/Leeds details grounding emotional reclamation. Non-obvious angle on "small scrap" as purpose pivot feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
