<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Donor heart renewal drives particular perception and ritual choices toward breakthrough; embodied via pulsing wing and heart rhythm. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during dye discovery beat, leaning reflective over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via observational density to CR closure at "Kaelen smiled as realization illuminated his consciousness," reweighting narrative magnetism premise with conceptual cost of adopted iridescent caution. Single scene, perfect orientation, persistent light constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating tea house, prisms, and sun trails constrain tracking method and mirror iridescent theme, charging final valley gaze image; sensory selection via POV bias vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode story magnetism signaled early, deepens decisively via dye mixture experiment under Accumulative lens, foreclosing prior paths with visible cost of transformed approach; agency in precise mixing clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perspective-driven magnetism emerges organically via wing shifts and dye tests, culminating in resonant CR "listeners see themselves reflected in the tale" that reweights prior observations without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in color/light noticing biases syntax and rhythm to focalizer's dye-master renewal; stable single POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels insight accumulation; minor paraphrase loop in repeated "floating rock tea house" and "quietly explosive" slightly dulls mid-section without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of transplant heart, morpho iridescence, and story magnetism transforms tropes via grounded dye rituals; bold conceptual risk in CR closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
