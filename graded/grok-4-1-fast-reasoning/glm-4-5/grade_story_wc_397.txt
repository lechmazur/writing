<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in clutching parasol tip under cold wind pressure, revealing contradictory death-seeking vs. life-connection impulses; Elena's endurance of volunteering earns final renunciation. Minor slips in stock epiphanies like "loose grip on reality had been a gift" feel unearned, but do not touch closure realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting reflections on ice cracks and Marcus's words tightening to CR closure: "she would stay" reconfigures death tourism with felt cost of foreclosed escape. Orientation anchors early (marina, tourist role); days-passing summary fits lyric scope without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains reflective choices (trawling nets/waters mirrors memory work); recurring ice cracking/moaning charges final image as quiet ending sound. Sensory hierarchy (wind lifting hair, freezing tears) biases via Elena's loose grip, evolving causally with sunset hues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn endings sound) signaled early, accumulates density through Marcus's "fold in patience" deepening knowledge to foreclose suicide path. Agency in sustained volunteering/endurance shows cost in tears-freezing beat; lens-consistent cadence shift charges "new beginnings" without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation (endings as beginnings) emerges organically from ice-melting image mirroring internal shift, reweighting premise without moralizing. Parasol tip reprise offers non-literal answer to patience question; earned via conflicted volunteering, ambiguity lingers in "quiet spaces in between."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (reality-drifting notices ice "moaning like living things"); voice texture modulates rhythmically with stress, diction biased to solace/whispering. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Endings can be quiet"), distinguishes Marcus's kindness idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection (e.g., "trawled not just waters but memories"); rhythm varies with short punchy realizations. Minor paraphrase loops on "solace" and parasol tip recurrences patterned but near-redundant; no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism via ice-marina volunteering transforms death trope into quiet transformation; parasol tip as bridge inflects organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via "ice breaking up earlier" callback.</comment>
