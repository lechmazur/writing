<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority through narrated glassblowing micro-choices revealing thawing persistence; embodied emotion in "gentle persistence, heat applied with wisdom." Minor diagnostic label-speak like "thawing heart" slightly undercuts contradiction depth without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from icicles to final globe placement; on-page Charged Poise closure in "Thus, we thaw" reconfigures abandonment with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Melting ice and control room relics (copper base) constrain choices and charge final window image; sensory hierarchy (dripping metronome, glowing glass) reflects POV urgency. Recurring dust motes and ice evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (thawing via creation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through glass expansion to globe completion with foreclosed grief path. Agency in persistent blowing/rotating shows trade-off cost; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative abandonment emerges organically from ice-glass parallels, reweighted in final light patterns without moralizing. Bookmark reprise shifts meaning subtly; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dramatic narration ("giving form to air"); rhythmic prose modulates from theatrical to "simply present" whisper. No head-hopping; diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("abandoned control room" 7x, "narrated" stems 6x, "ice melting" 5x) create template cadence and paraphrase churn across beats, dulling density (−1.2). Rhythms vary otherwise; metaphors consistent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing in control room transforms renewal tropes via inquiry vessels; dramatic narration as renewal tactic feels organic. Final reconfiguration risks quiet poise effectively.</comment>
