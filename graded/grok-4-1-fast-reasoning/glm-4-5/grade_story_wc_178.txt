<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied frugality in scraping tablet and conserving ink reveals traits under pressure; internal science-faith tension acts simultaneously in schematic ritual. Minor slips in diagnostic labels like "empirically ironic" feel unearned amid crisis. Final covenant seals earned change with palm marks as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to tile's unfolding and light projection (CR closure with integration cost). Orientation anchored early in study amid regime shift. Single scene causality tightens via ritual completion; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sealed chamber and reed pens constrain frugal actions; palace reimagined as observatory mirrors internal struggle, charging final light shafts. Sensory hierarchy (cool tile, flickering candle) filters through astronomer's bias. Recurring schematics evolve, grounding mysticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock before Nebuchadnezzar) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via schematic spiral to tile lift under textural lens. Agency in whisper and hand-press forecloses empirical path with covenant cost. One tightening suffices; drums externalize pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Science-faith harmony emerges implicitly from tile activation and palm symbols, reweighting divides in final image without moralizing. Encrypted patterns shift meaning organically. Resonant non-literal close ties to frugal devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in starlit schematics and cosmic whispers; rhythmic modulation builds to peak light engulfment. Poetic diction fits mystic astronomer without register drift. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrase loops ("dusky harmony," "empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion," "between regimes") across 5+ instances create template cadence and synonym churn, dulling mid-ritual density (−1.2). Minor mixed metaphors (cooled honey dato?); rhythm varies but propulsion drags in reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian magic square as star-gateway transcends tropes via frugal empiricism; tile unfolding feels inevitable from schematics. Risky mystic-science blend heightens transcendence beyond kings.</comment>
