<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mirror maker's motivation rooted in tradition and "boundaries" concept compels transformation with embodied actions like synchronized breathing; interiority concrete in hands and breath aligning with universe. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as repair process builds density to CR closure: dream settles as "navigator" reconfiguring sextant and orchard with fragility cost legible in final image of "glass mountains." Orientation anchored early in workshop/orchard/twilight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and twilight frost constrain via pulsing with breath, orchard reveals starlight fruits charging final image; sensory hierarchy mirrors maker's priorities. Recurrent quartz/tools as micro-setting hone transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to repair/capture dream tightens accumulatively through breathing alignment narrowing to transformation; agency in intention forecloses capture for freedom with fragility cost. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries emerges organically from repair events, final orchard image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in dream's freedom charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of mystical noticing (fog pulsing like breath); rhythmic poetic diction modulates with intensity. Whispers natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath, high density in process beat; loops in "boundaries," "synchronized breathing," "twilight frost" repetitions dull propulsion (−0.8). Figurative coherence strong but dense in peak without payoff harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror craft, dreams, sextant into boundary-erasing magic realism; risk in lyric process heightens stakes organically. Transformation of tropes via breathing intention feels inevitable.</comment>
