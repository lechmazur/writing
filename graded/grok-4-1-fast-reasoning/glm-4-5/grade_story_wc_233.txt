<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory draw/terror at the grotto entrance embodies internal conflict, with micro-choices like dismissing guards aligning to dream-rooted motivation; earned change at pool reflection forecloses royal burdens with felt cost. Maera's knowing pressure crucible-izes the relationship without oracle excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying dream-images to grotto density; on-page RR closure at "weight lifted... secret wellspring" reconfigures disenchantment with conceptual cost of hidden magic amid duties, exact line making before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's pulsing radiance and liquid sapphire constrain entry/approach while charging final ember image; sensory hierarchy (razor-rocks on fingers, moon precision) filters via climber urgency, with clouds above evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream unraveling) signaled early tightens accumulatively at starlight pool revelation, narrowing to true self with agency in approach; cost legible in "unchanged by years of royal burdens," charging poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of true self beyond obligation emerges via shifting images (younger reflection, dream patterns mirroring feet); final "lacy menace... promise" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Elara-limited POV with dream-biased perceptual signature (visceral visions, ghostly precision); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Every queen must rediscover"), distinguishing voices; rhythm modulates ascent tension cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action (fingers finding purchase); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("bleeding starlight... luminescent tears") at center but purposeful/consistent, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis transforms queen-quest trope via nursemaid bond, bleeding starlight core, and grotto reprise; risk in lacy menace tone heightens rediscovery stakes organically.</comment>
