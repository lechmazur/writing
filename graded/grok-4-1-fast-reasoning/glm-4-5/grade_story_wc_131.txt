<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via sense memory flood at tape discovery reveals character-particular reverence and resolve; motivation rooted in backstory but anchors present caching choice. Micro-choices like inspecting catalog under headlamp embody "kindly methodical" traits with isolation's cost felt in hidden endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine crawl to tape fragment discovery (pattern break), tightening to intervention plan as Charged Poise RR with cost of partial visibility in final paragraph. Orientation anchored early (crawl space beneath library, pre-dawn outage); one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pipe chases and cool pipes constrain travel and discovery, charging closure via cached fragment; sensory hierarchy (metallic hum, old books smell) reflects POV expertise. Sapphire hush evolves with dawn, mirroring internal hush-to-resolve shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guardian knowledge for needful) signaled early, deepens via fragment's schematic knowledge changing intervention options; agency in reverent removal/caching forecloses direct reveal with felt hidden-cost in planning beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden visibility emerges organically via fragment as "bridge" image reweighting isolation premise without statement; counter-reading (eternal shadows vs. emergence) lingers in final resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (sense memory bias, infrastructure intimacy); rhythmic modulation builds poetic texture without drift, prose as character in "kindly methodical" cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory; minor paraphrase loop in "kindly methodical" repeats (3x) dulls slightly but rhythm varies naturally. No filter stacks or muddled figs; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh wall-dweller premise transformed via tape fragment's history payoff; risk of poetic solitude heightens stakes organically, inevitable synthesis in indirect intervention feels non-obvious.</comment>
