<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted in noticing subtle changes, driving ritual actions; interiority particular but epiphany at glow moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of rituals building density to CR closure in glow/vibration beat; conceptual cost legible in reconfigured quest ("Her path forward was clear") reshaping prior understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Predawn bay, dew-kissed streets, and displaced objects filter through Aria's perceptual bias, constraining placements and charging final sunlit image with deepened resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding aliveness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shard ritual over mornings to glow tightening that reweights knowledge with felt quest commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of lingering love emerges organically from objects/houses; final image resonates but "inadvertently profound truth" line borders explicit echo, muting subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing "creeping normalities"); rhythmic, hushed diction modulates intensity, consistent under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel forward; minor paraphrase loops in repeated "quiet bay in spring"/streetlights phrasing dull late momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of object rituals and hush shard transforms house-aliveness trope; risk in poetic conceit ("streetlights daydreamed") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
