<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation rooted in family loss anchors idealism tempered by caution, with embodied trembling hands before "Shall we begin?" revealing pressure; contradictory impulses surface in mustering strength yet gentle approach, earning signature as redemption. Minor slip: micro-choices lack sharp hierarchy of values in peak concession mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from negotiation beats to cadence shift; orientation anchors Elian on terrace at midsummer by second paragraph. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in final clipboard placement and child's laughter, reweighting peace as perpetual practice with generational debt cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like salt air, scuffed shoes on weathered stone, and three suns' descent selectively filter through Elian's priorities, mirroring internal caution. Terrace and celestial shadows constrain ritual choices; final ethereal glow charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of brokering lasting peace signaled early, tightens accumulatively post-lunch via resource mapping and land concessions narrowing options. Agency in gentle persuasion forces trade-offs; visible cost of solitude charges Elian's signature moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty and redemption emerges from particulars like bittersweet wine and cracks in alliance, avoiding direct morals. Final child's laughter offers resonant non-literal answer to peace's possibility, reweighting prior failures with life's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in idealistic noticing of celestial dance and shadows; poetic rhythm modulates from steady voice to ethereal glow. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven in "Shall we begin?"; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in sensory integration; purposeful lyricism avoids monotony. Weakness: minor paraphrase loops on peace's fragility ("flawed beauty," "painful lessons") in final third dull closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh sci-fi inflection on negotiator trope via three suns and forever war, with clipboard's symbolic arc transforming routine into personal redemption. Bold risk in accumulative reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
