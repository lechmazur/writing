<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied (teeth ache from blues, cancer cells dividing), with obsession vs. mortality as contradictory impulses driving earned realization; final understanding of trust reforming feels compelled by prior quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure ("sound began to change... sound of trust reforming"), with cost legible in mortality and non-commercial choice; orientation anchored early in workshop details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse/shipwrecks constrain perception and capture (water amplifies color-sounds), charging final image where prototype harmonizes in water; selective sensory filter (phosphorescent jellyfish, fractured light) mirrors internal distortion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest betrayal sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed attempts to imprint tightening, with agency in absences-collection forcing trade-off (personal danger vs. healing insight); cost felt in cancer mortality charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (memories distorting like water/light, destruction to beauty), with final image non-literally repricing premise—trust stronger post-break—reweighting orchard/healing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (colors as bass/trebles) biases noticing, with rhythmic modulation under obsession; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" reprises twice, "cells divided" thrice) dull select beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia-like gift, post-Submersion world, and emotional acoustics transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with CR inevitable from particulars.</comment>
