<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to prove emotional absorption drives the experiment solidly, with traits like "firmly grounded" constraining her skepticism until the visions force a pivot. Interiority feels concrete in the vibration through fingers but veers into label-speak like "knew in her bones" without deeper contradiction. Final change to expanded quest earned but epiphany told more than embodied in peak communion beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns build density from emotion imprints to full memories, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when "truthful lies...crumbled" reweights her premise with assumption cost. Single scene anchors early (Elara, arbor, dawn by para 1). Pivotal press-to-window inciting incident motivates tightening without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: mist droplets enhance crystals, frost swirls constrain the method, pillars pulse to charge revelations. Hierarchy fits mystic POV, narrowing to vibrations and glows under experiment pressure. Final arbor hush evolution mirrors internal reconfiguration, with car window as micro-setting enabling core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove absorption) signaled early tightens texturally when memories deepen beyond emotions, forcing stance shift with legible cost in "certainty waver." Agency in pressing prism tests commitment; no coincidence resolves. Climax visions layer internal conflict without tidy win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of science-mystery blur emerges organically from prism revelations, with final image (warm prism wrapped) offering non-literal reweighting of "hidden connections." Subtext in frost stories avoids direct morals but "truthful lies" edges overt. Resonance from particulars like arbor hush shifting meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with mystic perceptual bias: notices "hum with shifted hush," selective to crystal energies. Voice texture modulates from anticipatory to revelatory rhythm without leakage. Compression in vision flashes purposeful and legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive exact phrases ("patterns in frost on a car window," "quartz arbor in mist") create template cadence across 4+ instances, dragging momentum in buildup beats; paraphrase loops restate motivation twice adjacently. Density strong in sensory propulsion but synonym churn (joy/sorrow/love/fear) dulls peak visions. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unconventional method (frost-mediated prism read) transforms object-emotion trope into fresh synthesis, grounded in arbor's crystal logic. Risky mystic-science blend feels organic, with memory reveal as earned inflection. No derivative echoes; premise specificity irreplaceable.</comment>
