<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits like analytical artistry compel the dare against geometry-defying paths, earning the final integration; embodied in noting mist emotions and crack patterns. Interiority concrete via sensory cues like chime's dissonant harmony, but slips into label-speak ("analytically artistic mind") dilute peak realization at fortress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (box, cracks, vault) build density to CR closure with cost (old life as memory, vault flickering). Orientation anchored early (tunnel under Oakhaven); one tightening at punch beam translating fortress walls narrows to partial revelation. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains via cracks guiding paths and mist forms mirroring stasis emotions, charging final arrow home. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (geometric patterns, pulsing constellations); evolves causally (vault materializes, dissolves). Micro-setting (punch warms, integrates) shapes choices without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel mysteries to fortress) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via time-split hour and flickering vault forcing partial exit with felt cost (old life memory). Agency in following cracks and approaching despite analytical dare; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mapping human secrets emerges organically from mist emotions to city connections reweighting premise; final image (seeing unspoken truths in streets) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in punch as truth-tool charges CR; complexity in metaphysical dare lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns as symphonies, arrows); voice rhythmic and selective under pressure (degrading to "trembling certainty" at vault). No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged poise ending. Diction matches mapper's lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., punch chime shifts ground), varied rhythm; but paraphrase loops ("trembling certainty" recurs, analytical mind repeated) and figurative density ("geometric symphonies") in discovery beats dull propulsion slightly (−0.6 artifacts). No closure harm; scaffold minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapper mapping metaphysical via punch-fortress; transforms discovery trope through irreplaceable elements like emotion-mist. Risky surreal vault risks gimmick but heightens stakes coherently (+0.3); inevitable hindsight in hand-integration.</comment>
