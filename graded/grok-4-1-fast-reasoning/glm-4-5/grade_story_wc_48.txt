<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in places like grandmother's voice but mostly abstract summaries; epiphanies like "broken and complete" feel diagnostic without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure via final placement and realization; cost legible in acceptance of imperfection foreclosing doubts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Feral nexus pressures introspection as wild character; seashell constrains final choice and charges glimmering image in thinning mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake against expectations deepens accumulatively to reconfiguration; visible cost in renouncing commercial current for artistic peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via cameos/hopes emerges organically; final seashell image resonantly reweights broken/perfect without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV lyrical voice with mist-biased perception; rhythmic modulation fits reflective pressure but some register elevation jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("lucidly watchful" x3, "against the current" x2, "ephemeral cameo appearances" x3) and metaphor density in every sentence dull propulsion; template cadence in reflections obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writer trope with nexus/seashell helix against commercial current; risk in lyric accumulation heightens introspection payoff.</comment>
