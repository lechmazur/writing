<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Priest's internal conflict embodied in "sat heavily" and cracked voice at letter reveal; earned renunciation forecloses repair path with pension cost, but backstory reflection slightly exceeds BRR without full micro-choice tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure—heart's silence reconfigures redemption premise with emotional cost legible in final pocket image; orientation anchored early, one tightening via light-filtered realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's ticking mechanisms and transom light constrain decision and charge final music-box harmony; sensory hierarchy (scent, dust, pause) mirrors priest's dawning stasis without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair vs. preserve) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through Eleanor's words and letter to renunciation with pension/emotional cost; one deepening suffices, agency in refusal forecloses fix option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-as-reminder emerges organically from heart motif and Eleanor's line, resonant CR in silent heart vs. harmonious boxes reweights apology premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with priest's perceptual bias (ticking hush); dialogue subtext-driven, distinct idioms (priest reverent, Eleanor direct); rhythmic modulation peaks at realization without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in sensory integration, but minor paraphrase loops ("vibrant hush" x2, "deliberate" echoes) and template stems ("he said softly") drag rhythm slightly; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clockwork heart from inmate transforms redemption trope via shop juxtaposition; fresh CR synthesis of silence/justice feels inevitable from ticking buildup.</comment>
