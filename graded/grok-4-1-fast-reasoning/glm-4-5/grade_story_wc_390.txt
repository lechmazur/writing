<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strength in embodied legacy ("vibrations travel through his bones") revealing contradictory panic/logic impulses; minor diagnostic label-speak ("logically emotional") flattens peak motivation without deeper tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore to climax (broadcast → run → ritual → intruders repelled); on-page DC closure via sonic waves with felt cost ("numinous yet deeply physical sensation").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ice "crunch," "fogged breath") filters through engineer's bias; stone floor constrains ritual strike, charging final serene marina image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect orb) tightens via footsteps echoing as reversal, forcing ritual agency; cost legible in bone vibrations and enduring duty burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fleshly ethereal legacy emerges organically via ritual blending tech/emotion; final key-to-forehead image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (vibrational sensitivity); rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in ritual beats propels cleanly; minor artifacts from azure/blue repetition and simile stacks ("cracked like distant bones") slightly dull immersion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh tech-magic synthesis (vibrational ritual repels intruders) transforms tropes via specific engineering legacy; risk in "fleshly ethereal" blend heightens stakes organically.</comment>
