<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation rooted in specific gift of hearing unspoken thoughts intensifies credibly to compel the rebellion plan; interiority concrete in "chorus of 'Why must we do everything this way?'". Internal conflict between coach's role and town's rigidity shown through embodied frustration. Final endurance of secrecy earns change with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via building whispers and grotto visits holds to CR closure in dawn displays reconfiguring town's silence into talk; shards transition legibly chronologically. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (coach, town, evening). Pivotal planning summarized weakens causal depth at climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto's magnetic field and starlight constrain/enable ability and planning, charging final reprise image; cobalt library/mist guide secretive access. Sensory details (pull of field, pulsing light) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal rebellion. Climax sky-starlight ties micro-setting to transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken curiosity vs. rigidity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through grotto visits to synchronized displays; one deepening in recruitment narrows secrecy options. Agency in organizing forecloses compliant path, but cost (effort/isolation) felt more than dramatized. Climax resolution via off-page town reaction undercuts on-page pressure legibility.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of possibility vs. routine emerges organically from chess puzzles/displays mirroring second thoughts; final classroom image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. Subtext in unspoken words/silences builds ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; complexity in humble scale lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (hearing unspoken, starlight motifs) biased to coach's wonder; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in grotto hush. Minimal dialogue natural in nod to librarian. No head-hopping; elisions (planning) purposeful for texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in grotto beats; specific diction (cobalt, magnetic pull) propels. Minor paraphrase loop in "forests of second thoughts" (three repeats) and crystalline metaphors slightly muddle peak planning without obscuring closure. No scaffold; clean syntax supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic coach, underground starlit grotto, and puzzle rebellion transforms trope of quiet revolution; unspoken hearing enables non-obvious tactics. Risk in poetic fable tone heightens stakes coherently. Dawn displays turn feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
