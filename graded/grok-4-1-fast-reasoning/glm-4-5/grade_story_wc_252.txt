<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "heart a battlefield of hope and fear" driving the final dive; micro-choices under pressure (pressing scrimshaw, whispering) earn rebirth with visible cost of former self. Contradictory impulses act in scene via conforming dock life vs. hidden aspects revealed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scrimshaw discovery → emerging text → whale calls tightening to island emergence; on-page Charged Poise closure ("emerged from the water reborn") with legible cost in vanishing and reimmersion. Orientation anchored early in dock work; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scrimshaw as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (studied, pressed) and charges final image ("dissolving into the water like salt sugar"); sensory details like "whale... reverberated through the water... into one's bones" filter through Mara's grace/restlessness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emptiness to true nature) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whale's call and scrimshaw detachment narrowing options; agency in ritual seals cost-legible dive foreclosing shore life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of conformity vs. true nature emerges organically via scrimshaw unlocking and island as "perfect expression"; final image ("dreams and reality seamlessly merge") resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (graceful strength, "fluid motion") modulates rhythmically from serene docks to ethereal climax; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; figurative language like "fragments of liquid moonlight" purposeful and voice-integrated in peak beats, no muddle or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of post-violence serenity with whale-summoned island transforms self-discovery trope; risk-taking in scrimshaw's evolving agency heightens stakes organically to inevitable rebirth.</comment>
