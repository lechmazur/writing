<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oracle's motivation intensifies convincingly from mild obsession to violent determination via embodied micro-choices like placing textured pebbles; interiority particular and conflicted without epiphanies; earned shift in closing the glowing booklet forecloses prevention path with felt acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with deepening hush density culminating in CR closure: booklet glows as darkness map, reweighting endless night from curse to canvas; cost legible in "not to prevent the endless night, but to guide others through it"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via star's vanish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pebbles' textures (smooth as glass, jagged as bone, warm as flesh) and booklet's flaking gold constrain choices and charge final glow; sensory hush builds purposefully, narrowing to star's flicker; recurring voids mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping via silence) signaled early, escalates texturally as hush deepens and star vanishes, forcing endurance agency; one tightening reweights options toward guidance over prevention, with torches futility as felt cost charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence/darkness as pathway emerges organically via pebble echoes and void sketches; final smile amid living hush offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, recharging prior motifs non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature obsessed with silences/textures; rhythmic hush modulates intensity purposefully; no elision or head-hopping, diction biased toward voids/absences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but patterned "hush" repetitions (ambered/marbled) border paraphrase loop in mid-build without full payoff, slightly dulling peak propulsion before glowing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope via silence-mapping and pebble futures transforms apocalyptic premise; risk in textural lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via hush-to-canvas arc.</comment>
