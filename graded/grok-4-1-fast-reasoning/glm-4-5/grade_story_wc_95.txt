<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to decode and teach emerges through concrete actions like aligning the needle card; mechanical arm integrates as symbol and tool in student demo. Interiority concrete but edges into label-speak ("diplomatically fierce"); student's comprehension feels earned via sparring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding density builds to CR closure in final walk, reweighting waiting with coordinates stored. Orientation anchored early (atrium, brook, sundial by para 2); one tightening via student interaction pays off without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial and brook constrain decoding choice and charge final image of "sunlight turning questions into destinations." Sensory details (whirring arm, prismatic light) filter through Aris's priorities, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode overture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via student parry that deepens philosophical pressure; cost legible in transformed waiting time. Agency in mental fencing forecloses mere eccentricity perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of questions-as-destinations emerges via motto, decoding, and demo without statement; final image reweights premise organically. Subtext in "dignified chaos" carries ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (philosophical lens on chaos); dialogue natural, goal-driven ("demonstrate while we wait"), advances stakes. Rhythm modulates from introspective to sparring cadence.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel momentum; minor paraphrase loop ("dignified chaos" x3) subtracts slightly but doesn't touch closure. No artifacts in peak demo beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophy, mechanical arm, needle decoding transforms tropes; risk in intellectual fencing payoff feels inevitable from setup.</comment>
