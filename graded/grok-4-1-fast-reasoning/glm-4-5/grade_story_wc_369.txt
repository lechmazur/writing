<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to map sorrow for tree-wisdom intensifies via raw hands and dream grouping, compelling sextant alignment; interiority embodied in healing and weariness, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup to pin-chime pattern break, yielding CR closure via sextant flare that reweights sorrow as resilience; cost legible in healed weariness acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit moonlight and scarred oak floorboard constrain sextant-moonbeam alignment choice, charging final humming-key image with arboreal resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dream-mapping tightens via pin-frequency match forcing conceptual deepening; agency in sextant adjustment yields visible healing cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final wave of understanding offers non-literal answer to tree-witnessing, reweighting quantified sorrow through oak-endurance image without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature attuned to labyrinth acoustics and wood truths; rhythmic modulation supports quiet revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to closure; minor figurative swirl ("liquid mercury") in climax adds texture without obscuring flare moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of dream-sorrow quantification and arboreal consciousness via sextant-chime feels inevitable and transformative, risking mundane miracle payoff.</comment>
