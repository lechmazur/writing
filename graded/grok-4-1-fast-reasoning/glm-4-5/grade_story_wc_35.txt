<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through coping method against subsumption risk; interior conflict embodied in trembling and hollow states during climax dip. Micro-choices like pressing palms and focusing will reveal values under pressure. Minor slip in alternating summary over simultaneous impulses caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from pools to pavilion reveal to transformation; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with trembling cost in emergence line. One tightening via sand-parting deepens stake. Orientation anchored early at fortress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Damp sands and coral stairs constrain journey choices, tidal pools charge discovery; recurring brittle/sturdy walls mirror internal states and evolve causally. Sensory hierarchy chef-specific (taste/remorse). Pavilion pool as micro-setting charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smooth memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seepage pressure and willful focus narrowing options in dipping beat. Agency in refusal-to-subsume forces trade-off with visible trembling cost. Coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of refining remorse emerges organically from tasting/smoothing actions; final lighter-heart image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting jagged regrets. Subtext in contagious risk avoids moralizing. Particulars like crystallized pool drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in taste/memory bias; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax submersion. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful. Minor register elevation in peak but lexicon fits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive motifs ("sturdy/brittle," "stored remorse") teach tone early but create synonym churn and template cadence in mid-journey beats, dulling propulsion (−0.8). Density high otherwise, rhythm varies. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef gift and remorse pavilion transforms trope of memory magic into sandpapering arc; risk in contagious submersion heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious coral-ice desert payoff inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
