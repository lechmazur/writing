<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in gravity curse/gift intensifies compellingly to acceptance; interiority concrete in hope-dread paradox embodied as "darkening brightness matched his emotional state." Final renunciation of self-loathing earned by timeline visions, but childhood backstory summary slightly abstracts early pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising to CR closure ("labyrinth wasn't external but within"); eclipse-tablet activation causal anchor grounds shift. Orientation clear by para 2; cost legible in "gripped the ancient tablet and pulled himself back," foreclosing deeper fractures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's "damp golden stones humming" and "bruised purple" sky constrain choices as nexus; recurring glow evolves with rain/eclipse, charging final softening image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (runes warm in pocket); no white-room—tactile, phosphorescent details mirror internal paradox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-understanding) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visions tightening to convergence chamber; agency in procedural steps forecloses normalcy path with dread-cost. One deepening sufficient; climax visions force stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of internal labyrinth emerges organically from timeline selves, resonant CR in "accepting all parts of himself" reweighting premise without statement. Particulars (celebrated/hunted versions) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "beautifully complex" without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (gravity defiance biases notice of hovering selves); rhythmic modulation builds to disorientation ("shattering glass"). No head-hopping; diction controlled, lyric compression in visions purposeful and legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action-atmosphere (runes "flared to life, projecting intricate patterns"); rhythm varies with pressure. Minor paraphrase loop in "fractured timelines" repeats (−0.3), but no closure touch; strong verbs propel without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Procedural generation timelines + gravity nexus fresh synthesis, inevitable hindsight from runes-viaduct rules; risk in "periodically eternal" payoff heightens without gimmick. Transformation of multiverse trope via internal conquest bold and coherent.</comment>
