<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to reawaken beauty drives consistent choices like matching heart rhythms to statues and tree, intensifying at climax; interiority concrete via vibrations and pulses, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal uprooting moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shell incites, music escalates density of wonder vs. mechanical suppression to RR closure in sapling's growth and world transformation with shell's crumbling as felt cost; orientation anchors early, single arc fits scope, one tightening as guardians stir post-uproot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard and statues constrain choices (heart rhythms to pass), sky-bridge charges final image with entwined roots/vines; sensory details (iridescent shell, humming air, copper sky) selective via Elayn's priorities, evolve causally without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty via sapling) signaled early, tightens via stirring statues forcing run; agency in music/rhythms narrows options under lens, visible cost in crumbling shell and endured pursuit charges poise at transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty breaking free emerges organically from mechanical-vs-magic conflicts and final reconfiguration; recurring pulses/resonance reweight premise without statement, inviting ambiguity in balanced world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward rhythms/vibrations; distinct poetic texture modulates with intensity (short urgent sentences in chase), no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density integrates action/atmosphere; minor paraphrase loops ("music carrying...across the divide") and repetitive "resonantly soft" in non-peak beats deduct slightly, but no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin heart-rhythms bypassing statues/orchard magic in mechanical world; transforms tropes via tactile pulses guiding causal beats to inevitable balance at closure.</comment>
