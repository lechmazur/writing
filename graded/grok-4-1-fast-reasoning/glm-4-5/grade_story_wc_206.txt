<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in grandmother's box and light reclamation drives actions, but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating the climax focus; competent without deep struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page RR/DC at midnight music box play; cost legible in time pressure and energy surge, but rust origin realization feels unearned without prior cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber amplifies hum and chimes, constraining tether action and charging final hum; sensory details (echoes, glows) mirror internal states purposefully without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop rust by midnight) tightens accumulatively via clock strikes and stone blaze, narrowing options with agency in humming/tethering; felt cost in fingertip surge and focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth/music vs. dishonesty/rust emerges organically through stone purity and final city-wide play; resonant non-literal close reweights without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-perceptual signature stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure from hum to blaze without leakage or generic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels with varied syntax, but repetitive "light"/"resonance chamber" loops and stacked similes (e.g., "perfume... violet in shadow") create minor density drag mid-build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lie-detecting stone, resonance magic, and rust-as-dishonesty transforms repairman trope; risk in abstract covenant pays off in tactile climax without gimmick.</comment>
