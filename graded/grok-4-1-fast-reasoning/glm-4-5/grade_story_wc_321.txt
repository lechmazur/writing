<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liam's motivation to merge timelines roots deeply in his fractured childhood, compelling micro-choices like tracing glowing patterns and radioing Althea; embodied optimism contrasts crew fretting effectively. Internal conflict minimal—unwavering positivity lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, softening peak agency at the merge signal. Childhood backstory anchors present via hourglass but borders BRR ceiling without strong present tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: radio checks, pattern adjustments, and grotto arrival chain to DC closure as hourglass fills with merging sands, reconfiguring realities with felt wholeness cost. Single continuous scene anchors orientation early (ferry deck at sunset); one tightening via "tonight's crossing" alignment narrows options. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of empty hourglass shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's "stalactites of frozen time" and "waters below [containing] memories" constrain merge via chronal energy, charging closure; sensory shifts (liquid starlight, ozone scent) filter through Liam's temporal expertise. Details selective—translucent hull, sideways clocks—evolve causally with transformation, mirroring internal unification without overt symbolism. Environment shapes tactics, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeline merge) signals early via "tonight's crossing"; causal escalation tightens as patterns "glow[ ] brighter" and parallel ferry appears, forcing final signal with wholeness cost legible in intermingled sands. Agency via Liam's throttle/pattern choices forecloses separation path. One meaningful turn suffices; live option of failure implied in Althea's doubt but crystallized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fractured selves unifying emerges organically from hourglass motif shifting to neural pathways, reweighting transience without moralizing; final ferry "vanish[ing] only by choice" resonates as non-literal answer to wholeness question. Subtext in translucent passengers' "knowing smiles" layers destiny's weight. Particulars avoid platitudes; counter-reading of eternal transience lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward temporal anomalies (glowing patterns "like a lover"); voice texture modulates poetically under pressure without drift. Radio dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Are you certain?"), distinguishing Althea's doubt from Liam's optimism. Rhythmic control in closure image intact; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propels via varied syntax, but minor paraphrase loops ("resiliently positive," "interconnected patterns" recur without fresh pressure) and figurative density in grotto beat border overwriting without muddle. High info density integrates action/description; no template cadence or scaffold dulls closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferryman myth with quantum timelines via hourglass sands intermingling like "neural pathways"; risk-taking in sideways clocks/three moons heightens stakes organically. Turns inevitable from early patterns; no derivative tropes—transforms Charon into ardent unifier. Satisfies 9+ test with non-obvious premise integrity.</comment>
