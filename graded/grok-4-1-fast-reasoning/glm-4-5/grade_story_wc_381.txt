<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to hush prophecy clear and intensifies via ritual, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority defaults to stock mystical phrasing like "quiet intensity" without character-particular flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from mapping silence to wing absorption; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in crane's release into current, reconfiguring prophecy with felt cost of summoner's trembling focus and exhale relief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook and wing as micro-settings constrain ritual positioning and transformation; moonlight/stones selective and purposeful, mirroring internal hush in "water flowing over smooth stones" without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake hushing prophecy signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deeper silence mapping and wing interface narrowing options; agency in final ritual movements charges closure image with visible intensity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting disruption to peace emerges organically from ritual particulars; resonant non-literal answer in crane's float reweights hush without moralizing, though ambiguity lacks sharp counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature biased to flowing silence; voice texture consistent in rhythmic mysticism, though minor register elevation in "terrestrially cosmic" feels slightly unanchored to summoner.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("quiet brook," "whispered secrets," "flow") and template cadence ("The [element] [transformed] as [simile]") dull propulsion across beats, obscuring cause/effect in ritual peak; synonym churn for hush/silence compounds density loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oxymorons like "tranquil blaze" and origami wing containing code offer fresh synthesis on ritual trope; origami prophecy absorption feels earned and inevitable in hindsight without close famous echoes.</comment>
