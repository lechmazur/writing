<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies from divination to creation, earned by pearl activation and shadow touch; interiority concrete in gasping understanding and fingertip vibration. Contradictory impulses subtle (reliance on predictability vs. embracing chaos) but act in scene via clutch and reach. Final endurance of unpredictability carries felt cost of lost steady visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via crystal hum and energy patterns, holds through shadow density increase to Charged Poise/CR closure in "infinite possibilities blooming like crystalline flowers," reweighting seer role with conceptual cost of foreclosed predictability. Single continuous scene fits defaults; orientation anchored by pilgrim entry (~50 words). One tightening at shadow detachment narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave vividly sensory (hummed resonance, complex harmonies, pulsing surfaces) and constrains choices—shadows inhabit structures, Elara touches vibrating crystal to complete circuit. POV bias filters via divination lens; recurring crystals/shadows charge final image, mirroring internal shift from clear threads to blooming chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pearl's purpose transforming visions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thickening shadows and independent movement forcing stance from control to magnification. Agency in reaching to touch crystal forecloses predictive path; cost legible in "chaos she'd never experienced" becoming embraced unpredictability, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of creation over prediction emerges organically from pearl catalyst, shadow circuit, and motivation shift; final image of "crystalline flowers in the bright darkness" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in "everyday magic" murmured amid manifestation avoids platitude via embodied pulse matching heartbeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV third close with perceptual signature (divinatory scanning futures, sensing vibrations); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from steady meditation to chaotic swirl under pressure. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("I prefer simply clairvoyant"); no head-hopping, elision purposeful in pilgrim exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shadow glowed with a suggested light... essence of bright darkness" advances atmosphere/plot); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels via escalating clauses. Minor paraphrase loop in "overlapping shadows" builds texture purposefully under accum lens; no scaffold or muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pearl-shadow-crystal synthesis transforms seer trope into "bright darkness" manifestation, inevitable in hindsight from pilgrim catalyst; "shadows... radiate their own illumination" fresh angle on magic as emergent circuit. Risky tonal balance heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
