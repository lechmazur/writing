<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to find story origins is concrete, rooted in parole and confinement backstory anchored to present ritual; interiority embodied through tactile shard handling and whispered moonlight. Earned realization shows contradictory impulses toward creation under constraint. Minor slip: final epiphany borders on unearned abstraction without one more micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds patterns of fragments and moonlight toward CR closure in vendor's insight on absence, with cost legible in parole limits shaping the ceremony. Orientation anchored early in store on opening day. One tightening via shard ritual opens door, reconfiguring access; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard and cloud sea vividly constrain access (only for lost souls) and enable ritual, charging final image of possibilities. Sensory details (pulsing fruits, humming bottles) selective via vendor's priorities, integrated into actions like tracing slate. Recurring shards mirror internal fragmentation, evolving with ceremony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful opening to find story origins under parole) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed visitor and ritual that forecloses inaction with conceptual cost of incomplete tales. Agency in gathering shards narrows options; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stories born from absence emerges organically via quantifying method and shard assembly, reweighting fragments into possibility without statement. Final image resonates as non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity of unspoken spaces; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward narrative potentials (e.g., pulsing fruits as captured tales). Voice texture modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful in magical idiom; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repetitive shard/bottle descriptions (e.g., "mindfully scattered" twice, multiple similar listings) dull density; minor template cadence in listing sentences. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors scatters propulsion in reflective beats. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parole-bound vendor harvesting moonlight absence transforms fragmented fairy-tale tropes into inevitable CR insight; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
