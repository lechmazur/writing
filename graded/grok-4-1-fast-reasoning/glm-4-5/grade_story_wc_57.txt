<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Seed collector's patience shown through hours of silent decoding, earning the gift, but interiority leans declarative ("felt a thrill of understanding") without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with observation density tightening to revelation; Charged Poise closure in rope handover and fog parting carries felt cost of time invested, legible in final path revealed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Knots and fulgurite constrain decoding choice and charge final dual-hand image; snow/fog sensory weave mirrors patient accumulation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake to learn weavers' methods signaled early, deepens accumulatively via silent observation to knot demo; cost of patience legibly forecloses hasty paths in fisherman's softening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Patience as key to wisdom emerges organically from knot-language parallel to fulgurite; final image of glass/rope in hands reconfigures preservation as patient listening without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature filters harbor through philosophical hush; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Only to those who know how to listen"), advances revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor loops in "muffle" and snow repetition dull mid-density; rhythmic hush supports tone but paraphrase in fog/snow descriptors drags propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Knot-decoding as weavers' language transforms mystic tropes via patient observation; fresh synthesis of fulgurite/knots feels inevitable in fog-parting closure.</comment>
