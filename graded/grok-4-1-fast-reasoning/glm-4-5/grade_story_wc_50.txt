<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reflective trait and peripheral vision enable unique method contrasting others' failures, rooting motivation in locksmith heritage; interiority concrete via finger-tracing gears. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously reduce depth, with competence dominating over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to pattern break at "The mechanism awakened slowly, first with a hesitant click," delivering DC/RR closure with legible cost of weeks-long patience. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's veined walls and shifting light reflections constrain choices, enabling method and charging final "reflections swirled around the chamber." Sensory selectivity (light angles at dawn/noon/twilight) mirrors POV priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair timer via echoes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through mapped geometries tightening to reconstruction; agency in "calibrate new gears" forecloses direct patching with deepening knowledge. Cost legible in time endured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving ephemeral moments via structure emerges organically from particulars, culminating in resonant CR: "wonder stored where reason could keep it safe," reweighting locks across time without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing bias); rhythmic prose modulates from patient observation to thrumming climax. No dialogue; diction controlled, perceptual filter consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in reflection mapping ("understanding growing... accumulation of small revelations") dull momentum slightly. No artifacts in closure; propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith reversing time-echo device via cavern optics transforms tropes; "harvesting echoes" as light geometries feels inevitable, with bold reflective conceit heightening stakes organically.</comment>
