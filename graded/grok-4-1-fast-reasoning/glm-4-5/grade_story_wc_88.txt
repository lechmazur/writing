<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses emerge in trembling hands amid forgotten past versus seeking empathy, but internal conflict summarizes more than acts simultaneously until ball-signing choice. Motivation to kindle empathy compels tunnel choice with felt cost of loop endurance. Minor epiphany slips in "jaded wonder washed over me" feel unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to CR closure: loop realization reconfigures journey premise with conceptual cost of eternal repetition, legible in "I signed the ball he handed me, completing the circle." Orientation anchors early in cavern; shards via reflection fit defaults without debt. One tightening via younger self encounter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and tunnels constrain choices via matching symbols, charging final emergence image; sensory pulsing reflects internal ghosts. Details integrate via tactile ball warmth and underground rivers, mirroring emotional haze without stasis. Body as micro-setting in "weight of my dirty past pressed down like water" embodies stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to kindle empathy escalates accumulatively through newspaper patterns to loop deepening, narrowing options into self-created cycle; agency in left tunnel choice and signing forecloses linear path. Cost legible in repetitive walking "until empathy bloomed." No major reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via remembering/forgetting emerges organically from loop and ball motif shifting from mystery to cycle tool, offering non-literal answer in final emergence without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like signed date "twenty years from now" reweights premise. Avoids tidy binary via fractured society's backdrop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual bias toward ghostly pulses and leather stitching; voice texture modulates reflectively without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven in younger self's reveal advancing plot. Minor register elevation in epiphanies but consistent idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("clean slate seeker," "jaded wonder," "delicately robust") create paraphrase churn in reflective beats, dulling density; synonym cycles on empathy/past obscure propulsion. Rhythm varies but template stems like "I touched the baseball again" recur. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time-loop baseball in empathy quest synthesizes fresh via underground society and newspaper codes, transforming tropes through self-confrontation. Loop payoff feels inevitable from symbol-matching buildup. Bold circular structure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
