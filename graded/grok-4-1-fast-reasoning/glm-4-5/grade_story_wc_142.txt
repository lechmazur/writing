<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance creates contradictory impulses shown in early tracing of murals versus later bridging actions; micro-choices like mapping and slipping proposals earn the resolved endurance with felt cost in stone return. Interiority concrete via pattern recognition, though some desperation summarized flatly. Blind spots in assuming council sympathy balanced by struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density builds to graffiti actions tightening stake, landing Charged Poise/CR closure in stone placement and earpiece removal reconfiguring belonging with conceptual cost of partial evolution. Orientation anchored early in Neptunia raft details. One meaningful deepening via encoded resistance suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Graffiti murals constrain choices as encoded network, charging final spiral symbol; foundation stone handled tactilely across beats mirrors internal states. Sensory hierarchy (saltwater-funnel clash, neon fish) filtered through Maya's orderly bias integrates purposefully. Spatial coherence in rafts and ferris wheel maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate gentrification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rumors-to-meetings pressure forcing graffiti tactics; agency in flash mobs and proposals forecloses full takeover path with visible partial-victory cost. Desperation felt in sleepless mapping tightens once effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of encoded resistance emerges organically from graffiti particulars shifting to layered victory; final image of spiral reweights dual allegiance without moralizing. Subtext in "water remembers" implies ambiguity of ongoing flow. Earned from specific struggle, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing diction; rhythmic syntax modulates from chaotic sensory intake to poised closure. Minimal dialogue natural ("signs and symbols"). No head-hopping, elisions purposeful in time compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "encoded messages/graffiti" across paragraphs dull mid-section density (-0.6); rhythm varies but repetitive "clutched/traced" gestures border template cadence. High info density in sensory integration, clean grammar. Minor overwriting in victory summary doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival rafts and graffiti codes transforms gentrification trope via orderly decoding; risk in visual-language resistance heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes, premise commits to floating adaptation.</comment>
