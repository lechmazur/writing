<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through grief poured into engine modulation; contradictory hope drives ritual to earned acceptance of loss. Micro-choices like rhythmic throttling reveal values hierarchy with emotional cost. Repetition of "mournfully eager" borders on label-only without deeper variance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound/memory density builds to giggle's pattern break as CR, reweighting restoration premise with felt emotional cost in "he hadn't restored the laughter; he'd merely remembered." Single scene oriented by para 1; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel constrains sound direction to house, amplifying warped lullabies and returning giggle to charge closure image. Sensory focus on vibration, hum, thrum reflects POV urgency; stone walls mirror internal echo of absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates via density increase in layered sound to giggle reversal, narrowing to acceptance under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in soothed ache and foreclosed restoration; agency in modulation tightens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory's resonance in absence emerges from ritual particulars, final image of "ghost of laughter lingering" as CR reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in sound-as-ghost avoids tidy resolution, invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sonic bias ("off-key wind slipping through keyholes"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in sound layering, but paraphrase loops ("mournfully eager" x4, "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" verbatim x2) dull momentum; minor template cadence in repetitive stems. Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bold premise transforms leaf blower into grief orchestra in echo tunnel, inevitable synthesis of sound/memory yields fresh haunting; risk in ritualistic closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
