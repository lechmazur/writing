<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies with giant's awakening; embodied cost at collapse ("future now shortened") earns closure endurance. Interiority concrete via pendant touch and trembling hands, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: disturbance → pendant use → chamber → shatter DC with lifespan cost legible at "borrowing so much time." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in rooftop canals; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and pendant constrain leaps and door activation, charging final shatter; sensory details (pulsing water, hum) vivid and POV-filtered by illustrator's observational bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore cadence before awakening) signaled early, tightens via "structure lurched violently" forcing desperate borrow; agency in gripping pendant drives DC with unmistakable lifespan cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice for rhythm emerges organically from interrupted patterns to restored flow; final image of collapse reweights personal cost against universal harmony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in meticulous observations (sketchbook clues, crystal map); rhythmic prose modulates tension, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image (e.g., "water slowed, forming intricate crystal-like patterns"); minor figurative stretch in "memories of sounds not yet created" near peak but no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban ecosystem, time-sculpting pendant, and echo chamber transforms tropes; risk in giant's nap timeframe heightens stakes organically to inevitable collapse image.</comment>
