<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Insomniac poet's motivation to transform pain roots consistently in insomnia-as-gift/curse, compelling verses-to-blossoms arc; embodied tremble and final acceptance earn endurance with mortal cost, though micro-choices lean summative over contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from postcard arrival to blossom flourishing across shards, teaching pattern early; closure as resonant reconfiguration (legacy pulses post-death) lands with legible cost in poet's first sleep, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shell's pearlescent, whispering walls and emergent bioluminescent blossoms constrain poet's craft and charge final pulsing image; sensory selection (scents, glows) filters through transformative urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pain-to-beauty stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via blossoms' spread against soul-darkness; poet's agency in lullabies forces endurance, mortality as visible cost reweighting options in death beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of suffering-to-serenity emerges organically via petal-verse legacy, final postcard pinning reweighting isolation without statement; complexity lingers in acknowledged sorrow beneath joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with cosmic-organic perceptual signature ("photosynthesize pain"); rhythmic modulation heightens transformation beats, no slippage despite time shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense, varied syntax propels textural build without loops dulling closure; coherent metaphors (nebulae constellations to blossoms) in peak beats, minor repetition ("centuries of longing") contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shell-postcard-blossom synthesis transforms longing into living armistice inventively; centuries-spanning lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without template echoes.</comment>
