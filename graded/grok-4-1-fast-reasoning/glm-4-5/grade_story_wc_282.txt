<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to voice the unknown drives descent and contact, rooted in her sensitivity, with embodied emotions like tingling fingers; however, the epiphany at fossil contact feels slightly unearned without prior contradictory impulses acting in scene, diluting peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: compulsion leads to descent therefore discovery, touch therefore visions and CR closure (realization of role with cost of early awakening); orientation anchored early at cliff; fossil's response reconfigures knowledge on-page with felt purpose cost in final climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal cave network vividly sensory (creaking rope, cool stone, darkness), constraining descent choice and charging fossil chamber image; thermal equipment integrates purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand sleep via mapping) tightens at fossil touch, narrowing options via visions; agency in cautious approach and hours of learning forecloses safer path with danger cost, legible in "rope creaking" and renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging unknown emerges organically via fossil's thermal language and Maya's translation role; final pouch image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant through guardianship motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (emotional heat signatures as maps); rhythmic prose modulates from windswept cliff to cave intimacy, whisper dialogue natural and revealing ("How can you float?").</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "emotional imprints/thermal signatures" and synonym churn around fossil brightness dull mid-chamber density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation sensory mapping and factually mystical fossil transforms tropes; floating leaf's visions and pouch settling feel inevitable from cave guardianship pattern.</comment>
