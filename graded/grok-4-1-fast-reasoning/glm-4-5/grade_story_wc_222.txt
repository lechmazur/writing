<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivations clear and trait-consistent (chivalrous theft for greater good), but interiority relies on labels like "sacredly playful" without deep contradictory impulses acting in scene; final determination feels told via summary realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore chain (piece placements open paths); on-page DC closure as lid placement mends sky with felt heroic cost; master's pre-arrival slightly unmotivated but doesn't break chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound spire's glowing blue ice and chambers constrain piece placements and ascent choices; wrong green sky charges climax image, mirroring fractured reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend sky via lid) signaled early with causal tightening through sequential puzzles narrowing path; agency in placements drives escalation, but lacks sharp reversal or trade-off cost beyond effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of strategic embrace of unknown emerges via chess motifs and sky fix, but master's line "life is a strategy game" overtly states thesis, flattening subtext in final beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with wonder-biased perceptual signature (e.g., sky "too green, too vast"); dialogue distinct and goal-driven, master's wisdom contrasting Kael's questions to reveal stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor trait-label repetition ("chivalrous thief") creates slight synonym churn but doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chess pieces encoding spire secrets transforms puzzle-quest trope into reality-mending strategy game; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight via causal chain.</comment>
