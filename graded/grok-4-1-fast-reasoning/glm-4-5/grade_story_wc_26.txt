<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope drives vigilant observations with embodied tension in stone grip; minor slip in epiphany whisper feeling summarized rather than fully contradicted by prior internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via observational buildup to CR closure at shadow's face-reveal with luminous regret cost; orientation anchored early in library/job, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming library and cloud-flowers constrain shadow play and charge moonbeam finale; river stone as micro-setting grounds Elara's choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope-preservation deepens accumulatively from anomaly notice to nightly vigils and confrontation; closure cost legible in regret without agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love's persistence emerges via shadow evolution to CR repricing; final stone-warmth image reweights anomalies non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sharp perceptual signature on light/shadows; lyrical rhythm modulates from observation to revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but repetitive phrasing loops ("blooming library above the clouds" x6, exact "comparing silent video footage" reprise) dull minor beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh unbound-shadow premise in dream-share world transforms ghost tropes via textural evolution; risk-taking lyricism heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
