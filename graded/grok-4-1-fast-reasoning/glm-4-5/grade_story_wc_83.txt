<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grief/purpose but lacks contradictory impulses acting in the harvest scene; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; "bleak exhilaration" feels like diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with motivated descent and absorption leading to crystal's transformation; Charged Poise closure at "ready for the next hunt" reconfigures stakes with felt cost of prior loss; orientation anchors early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective details like "overgrown with mutated vegetation" and amphitheater filter through Elias's hunt; crystal as recurring object constrains choices and charges final image of "infinite possibility."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting during narrow window tightens causally at landing and absorption; agency in descent forecloses detection risk with legible exhilaration cost; no opposition flattens peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-forged possibility emerges organically from harvest; final image of ruins as "infinite possibility" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias via crystal; rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction like "intangibly tangible" borders register drift in peak absorption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive loops on "bleak exhilaration" (3x) and "unused potential pools" create paraphrase churn touching final third; template stems in crystal descriptions ("pulsed," "glowed," "swirling") dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc potential-harvesting via geode and perturbation theory transforms survivor trope; hunt's ingenuity feels inevitable from crystal's evolving role.</comment>
