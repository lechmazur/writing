<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong myth-busting motivation drives micro-choices like playing the cello and weaving perspectives, earning a credible change in worldview; interiority embodied via vibrations in bones and heartbeat sync. Minor diagnostic repetition of "gloomy cheerfulness" borders on label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via object discoveries to CR closure ("uncertainty itself was the point") with conceptual cost in embracing unknowns; compass stopping at chart tightens meaningfully. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (dust galaxies, cello hums filling space) filters through POV priorities; observatory and storm constrain exploration and charge final dawn image. Micro-setting via cello/telescope guides choices without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early escalates accumulatively via cello memories revealing debate, narrowing to harmony choice; agency in completing melody forecloses singular answer with felt cost of uncertainty. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of multiple cosmic interpretations emerges organically from cello dialogue fragments and harmonized melody; final compass-to-horizon image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like Lyra telescope recharge premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (myth-busting lens on artifacts); distinct poetic texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, as in "dust particles danced... miniature galaxies." No dialogue; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("gloomy cheerfulness" x3, "retell" repetitions in ending) and summary telling in final revelation dull peak slightly; rhythm varies, no major artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting with cello-memory mechanics transforms tropes; cello's reimagined conversations create inevitable hindsight ingenuity, risking poetic tone without gimmickry obscuring closure.</comment>
