<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's methodically curious traits drive concrete micro-choices like footage overlays, culminating in earned shift to "shielded openness." Embodied emotion in "trembling hands" reveals character under pressure without stock phrasing. No pivotal unmotivated moments; interiority particular to map framer's worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern in footage/shadows builds density to constellation alignment CR, reweighting map tear as threshold with conceptual cost in experiential silence. Orientation anchored in opening vault/project description. Single scene, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vault's rain drumming and fading frescoes constrain solitary focus, mirroring erasure and charging final repair image. Sensory details (persistent water, stone echoes) filter through Elara's perceptual priorities, evolving with discovery. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen henge via silence interpretation) signaled early, tightens via pattern discovery forcing empathetic reconfiguration; cost legible in foreclosing physical reopening. Agency in methodical overlays under lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred silence emerges organically from particulars like tear alignment; final "honor it as a threshold" reweights premise non-literally with ambiguity's cost. No moralizing; resonance from map-heart synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature on absences/patterns; diction/rhythm modulate from curiosity to revelation without filter excess. Voice embodies framer's bias, consistent under discovery stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via integrated details; minor "silence" echoes purposeful for theme, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Propulsion clear in "aligned the torn map" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Celestial chapel twist synthesizes cartography/footage organically, transforming henge trope; risk in conceptual reopen inevitable from patterns, fresh voice on silence-empathy.</comment>
