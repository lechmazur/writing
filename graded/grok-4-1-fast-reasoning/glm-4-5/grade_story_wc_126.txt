<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's acoustically perceptive trait and family-rooted motivation compel the climactic playing, with micro-choices like placing the bowl revealing values under silence's pressure. Interiority feels concrete via violin memories, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Earned change lands via realization without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: daily routines build to evening realization and playing as Resonant Reconfiguration, repricing hush as music with felt loss/renewal cost in final image. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/shipwrecks. One tightening via storytelling cue suffices; closure cost legible in family's tears and father's gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shipwrecks and bowl as micro-settings constrain/enable sound amplification, charging the playing climax and final image of "cracked greenhouse windows and listing shipwrecks." Sensory hush/vibrations filter through Kael's bias purposefully. No white-room; tactile, lived-in evolution fits lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound in silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via perception to playing that crystallizes stance with renewal cost against burn-loss. Agency in bowl/plucking narrows options under hush pressure. One deepening via realization forces trade-off, legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-unfinished emerges via particulars (bowl, wrecks, hush-to-symphony), final image reconfiguring premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity. Father's line echoes teaching organically without sermonizing. Resonance from conflicted loss/renewal avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature on vibrations/echoes; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to charged poise at playing. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You have found beauty..."). No head-hopping; elision of routine taught early, pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "hush"/"silence" (e.g., "chronic hush... not an absence of sound but a different kind of music") dull peak slightly (-0.4). No scaffold in closure; metaphors coherent, integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn hush, shipwreck amplification, and perceptual violinist transforms quiet apocalypse trope via irreplaceable setting/object constraints. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
