<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to restore harmony is consistent and embodied via vibrations felt in his legs, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as restoration builds density through repeated steps and vibrations; closure RR lands on final fork strike with town echoing in chord, cost legible in his patient departure leaving it humming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain precise footsteps and frame revival, charging final pulse; sensory details like "moss-furred stones" and evolving glow integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of averting collapse escalates accumulatively via steadying hum and visible repairs like fusing windowpane; one tightening reweights harmony with felt endurance cost in hours passed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of balance through patience emerges organically from particulars like fork-channeled steps; final image of humming sanctuary offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature attuned to resonance (e.g., "note decayed") with rhythmic modulation under sustained action; stable limited POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of fork strikes building pattern; minor overwriting in metaphors like "cracks spiderwebbing backwards" stays coherent without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sound-healing with ghost town revival through precise, irreplaceable footsteps-rhythm mechanic; risk-taking in accumulative lyric form heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
