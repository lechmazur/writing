<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strength in whimsical perception embodied through pattern-seeing (e.g., nest mirroring constellations); weakness in label-only repetition of "inevitably whimsical" flattening internal conflict into summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with clear early orientation at temple; CR closure lands on-page in notebook-writing realization reconfiguring creativity, cost legible in past emptiness foreclosed ("given away pieces of her own heart").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (raindrops on petals, dripping ceilings) filter through Elara's priorities, charging final temple-as-church image; micro-setting (nest) constrains epiphany beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle creativity via thread) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through nest-touch and pattern-tracing to stance crystallization; agency in mindful attention forecloses formulaic past with felt emptiness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically from nest/installation particulars with resonant CR ending; weakened by direct articulation ("thread... mindful attention") bordering thematic echo in realization beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature (patterns in twigs); minor drift from repetitive phrasing erodes rhythmic control under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("after the cloud bursts" x4, "prismatic quiet" x3, "keeper of secrets" x3, "lotus temple..." variations) create template cadence and synonym churn dulling closure image; artifacts in final third cap high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter's emptiness with nest-spiral epiphany transforms epiphany trope; repetition patterns hedge boldness into lyrical litany without full risk payoff.</comment>
