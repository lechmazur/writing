<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation as "fragile seedling" to preserve dream drives micro-choices like coffee ritual and violin play; embodied contradiction in "mulberry ache" mingled with new thrum shows earned endurance. Interiority concrete via plant pricks and bone resonance. No stock phrasing, but minor over-competence without deeper blind spots slightly tempers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coffee dregs → propagate insight → harmonic play → crystalline dust absorption builds to Charged Poise closure with new violin budding from plant. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara, observatory, midsummer). Cost legible in "original violin lay inert, its internal fractures now deep scars."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet drapes absorbing arctic light and greenhouse plants constrain choices, guiding dust to desert rose; final image of violin budding charges closure. Sensory hierarchy (cold vacancy hum, thorn pricks) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (workbench, calipers) integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve violin dream vs. empire) signaled early, tightens via coffee vision of shattering → propagate reversal narrowing options. Agency in directing dust shows trade-off; cost felt in original's inert shell and persistent ache. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of propagation over dominion emerges organically from frost-as-pollen and shoot-through-shards image, reweighting "perforated destiny" in final bud. Resonant non-literal answer in "dream...now lived within the plant"; complexity lingers in mingled ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (plants as antennae, frost pollen) biases noticing toward resonance and growth; rhythmic modulation swells with chord play. Stable close-third POV with no leakage; purposeful compression in ritual pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Chaotic水下摄影" artifact breaks immersion mid-ritual, docking for line-level opacity; minor cold/repetition churn in climax (-0.4 total). Density high with multi-job lines (e.g., bow draw freezes air while advancing sound), propulsion clean. No loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice violin harmonics propagating via plant telepathy transforms artifact-trope into dream-vs-empire calculus; risk in perforation-as-birth heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established frequency docs.</comment>
