<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in gift-as-burden drives persistence, but interiority abstracts emotions into poetic summaries without strong contradictory impulses in the revelation beat; micro-choices like aligning the prism feel earned but lack embodied stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from daily tracking to meteor-triggered revelation and prism glow as Charged Poise closure; fragile light ("would not last forever") makes cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pavilion's humming and resonance constrain choices by encouraging star work and mirroring prism light at climax; selective sensory details (wind melodies, vibrating panels) filter through Elara's pattern-seeing bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle to prove meaning) signaled early tightens via meteor revelation narrowing to alignment action under accumulative lens; agency in "trembling hands" placement forecloses doubt with fragile light as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of patterned meaning emerges organically from star visions and hush revelation, resonating in beacon harmony without overt moralizing; final "thistle-blown hope" image offers non-literal answer reweighting collapse as transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of retrocognitive patterns; lyrical rhythm modulates effectively from routine to wonder at "light grew stronger, splitting into colors," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in pavilion "song/hum" repetitions and repetitive "she understood/believed" stems dull some beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hush concept, and post-collapse beacon transforms tropes into inevitable possibility; risk in abstract "shard of hush" pays off uniquely at prism core glow.</comment>
