<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in gift as strength/burden drives planting seed micro-choice with embodied emotion in palms on glass. Contradictory impulses surface in haunted peace turning to smile of certainty. Epiphany feels slightly unearned without deeper prior struggle, but endurance of cheerful gloom earns final stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density of seeds/glass/cave builds to CR closure where "nothing was ever truly lost" reconfigures disappearance premise with conceptual cost of prior conjecture's limits. Single scene anchors who/where early; one tightening via seed germination narrows speculation to wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iridescent geode cave vividly selective via POV (shimmers lift spirits, cracks host seeds), constraining choice to plant in wall and charging final sprouting image. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile/glow over broad catalog; mirrors internal cheerful gloom evolving to balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock path secrets before fade) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via seed visions forcing realization trade-off (speculation foreclosed). Agency in planting tests commitment; low external pressure but internal cost legible in urgent whisper and burden lift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from particulars (glass fragments to snapshots, seeds to flowers); final image reweights missing pieces without moralizing. Direct line "disappearance was not loss, but metamorphosis" borders statement but anchors resonance from prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close third, perceptual signature biases toward emotional transliteration (glow patterns, visions from germination). Rhythmic modulation builds density; minor repetition risks committee feel but stays POV-bound without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("cheerful gloom" x4, "before memory fades" x3, "paths disappear" x5) and synonym churn (scattered seeds, missing pieces restated adjacently) dull density across final third, obscuring closure propulsion. Template cadence in "The [noun] [verb-ed], [observation]" runs erode rhythm; overwriting via stacked metaphors (e.g., sadness/acceptance waltzing) violates logic mildly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist gift, crater glass, seed metamorphosis transforms disappearance trope into inevitable wisdom arc. Risky lyric compression of visions pays off in hindsight; no close template echoes, voice commits to iridescent particularity.</comment>
