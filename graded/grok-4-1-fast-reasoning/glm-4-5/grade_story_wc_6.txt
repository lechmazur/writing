<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to transform legacy via grafts is embodied in concrete actions like wrapping unions amid fire; internal paradox of father's arson drives endurance with felt cost in protecting scarred plants. Contradictory impulses act in scene (compassion vs. fire's rage), earning final renunciation of destructive inheritance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds from cloud migration to fire's creep, culminating in CR closure via dawn garden image repricing destruction-as-renewal with conceptual cost of scarred survival. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at embers landing narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand constrain choices (sand nourishes grafts, lagoon centers post-fire); recurring dunes/garden evolve causally with fire, charging final sun-mirror image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's priorities, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save grafts/prove scars sing) signaled early, tightens via embers forcing blanket shield with visible cost (surrounding destruction); agency in micro-choices coheres under accumulative lens, crystallizing stance in dawn return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive scars emerges organically from graft action and legacy motifs, resonating in final rose tending without moralizing; "scars can sing" whisper in garden slightly echoes thesis, muting peak subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased toward transformative images (clouds, water); rhythmic modulation heightens urgency in fire beats, diction purposeful without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive motif phrasing ("migration of clouds," "gracefully alert," "scars can sing") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling density in reflective beats; syntax varies but synonym churn on legacy reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arsonist-daughter firefighter grafting amid fire synthesizes paradox ingeniously, transforming tropes via volcanic sand/coin; fresh premise risks lyric closure on renewal without hedging.</comment>
