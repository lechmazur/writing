<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's adaptable archivist traits shine in precise tool placement and braid reconfiguration, rooting motivation in consistent puzzle-solving drive; interiority concrete via delight in "clear complexity." Minimal internal contradiction limits depth, but actions align under pressure without unearned shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via door appearance → seal match → rope reconfiguration leading to DC closure with Croft's arrival; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in fables' warnings reweighted by successful merge at "face to face with the missing Professor Croft." Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clock tower's gears, pendulum, and door constrain choices via archival tools on workbench and celestial timing; sensory details like humming fibers and golden light filter through Eleanor's professional bias. Recurring rope charges final image, mirroring internal mapping of boundaries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel vanishings) signaled early, tightens via braid reconfiguration forcing temporal merge under causal lens; agency in precise redirects narrows options with fables' warning pressure. Escalation culminates in Croft's appearance, but visible cost remains oblique rather than viscerally paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence/absence emerges organically from fables, seal, and rope merge, reweighting confusion-to-clarity in final encounter without statement. Rope image shifts from anchor to successful bridge, charging closure non-literally; ambiguity lingers in warnings vs. triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in methodical observations like "three strands intersecting at seven points"; voice modulates rhythmically from calm documentation to awe at light. Brief Croft dialogue natural and goal-advancing; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</grade>7.8</comment>Prose propels via varied syntax and sensory density, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "warmly methodical" and template stems ("Eleanor [action]") in setup dull early momentum; no closure impact. Clean grammar, strong verbs in peak reconfiguration beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival precision with temporal rope-braids transforms time-travel trope via university fables and seal-rope resonance; risk in celestial alignment pays off inevitably at Croft reveal. No derivative echoes; voice commits to clear complexity.</comment>
