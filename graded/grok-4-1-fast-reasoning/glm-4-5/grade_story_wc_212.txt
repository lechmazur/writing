<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anya's motivation intensifies viscerally from egg-hatch mortality to final reach into vortex, embodied in bare feet on ice and crystallized breaths; contradictory furious tranquility acts in seed arrangement under pressure. Final realization earned by prior micro-choices without unearned epiphany. Minor abstract phrasing in "texture of borrowed time" does not flatten pivotal closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via seed spirals decreasing entropy to vortex manifestation as Resonant Reconfiguration (CR), reweighting preservation to experience with conceptual cost of fragility in final image. Orientation anchored early in atrium/seed jars/egg context. One tightening at final jar suffices; closure cost legible in "fragile and yet eternal."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains via subzero grip on bare feet and pulsing walls mirroring internal state; starlight evolves from filtering to responsive, charging vortex as inverted tree. Sensory selection (crystallized breaths, frost like fireflies) purposeful, POV-biased toward seeds/time. Recurring jars/seeds guide choices, integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feel borrowed time via vortex) signaled early post-egg, tightens accumulatively through entropy-decreasing arrangement narrowing options to final placement. Agency in micro-choices forecloses cataloging for visceral connection; cost felt in mortality revelation and trembling hand. No reversal needed under textural lens, but pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. experience emerges organically from seed arrangement to vortex touch, reweighting in final CR: "texture of borrowed time was none other than the texture of herself." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like oak cap and spirals without token motifs. Invites ambiguity in fragile eternity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature tuned to entropy/time (e.g., "precise duration of their dormancy requirements"); rhythm modulates from deliberate breaths to breathless vortex. Purposeful compression in patterns taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short anticipatory final moment vs. flowing arrangement); density high, integrating setting/action. Overwriting in peak build-up—"wild serenity...forest...hurricane" mixed metaphors slightly muddle (−0.4), but purposeful for lyric texture; minor paraphrase echoes of "paradoxical state" in atrium description. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed genetics, entropy reversal, temporal vortex via family heirloom transforms tropes into visceral time-feel post-egg; risk in abstract physics grounded in tactile arrangement pays off at closure. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
