<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in failed revolution intensifies compellingly to manuscript choice, with embodied sorrow in tracing shard; internal conflict shows in whisper rejecting excavation for reimagination, but minor label reliance on "poetically inclined" slightly abstracts traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from struggle to manuscript completion; strong CR closure in gathering around shard reweighting history with conceptual cost of acknowledged pain; orientation anchored early in Chronos study.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and temporal storm constrain choices (covering mirrors enables writing), charging final image of uncovered mirrors and flowing Time; sensory selectivity (shimmering curtains, golden dust motes) filters through Elias's poetic bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bridge dispute signaled early tightens accumulatively via storm-deepened writing flow, narrowing to transcendent narrative; agency in devising poem forecloses violent paths with felt cost in "burnished sorrow," legible in representatives' astonishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reimaginable history emerges organically from shard handling and writing, resonant non-literal answer in final constellation image reweighting artifacts as possibilities; avoids moralizing, embraces complexity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (shard as "vessel of stories"); rhythmic diction modulates with storm intensity, distinct texture in syntax; no dialogue, but internal voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "poetically inclined" echoes and synonym churn ("shimmering fragment/glimmered/light") dull two mid-beats; no closure touch, metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible Time, baroque asteroid, and poetic historiography transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative closure heightens reimagination stakes, inevitable in hindsight from shard motif.</comment>
