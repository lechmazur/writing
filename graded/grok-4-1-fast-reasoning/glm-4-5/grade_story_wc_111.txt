<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in Elias's withered mirroring of garden cycles, with pragmatic belief driving rituals; interiority concrete via hands brushing leaves and marble polishing. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps at strong band, as harmony dominates without peak crisis testing. Final endurance of cycle feels earned but lacks visible cost on pivotal scientist prep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to CR closure (whisper/rustle reweights quantification premise with Elias's deepening bond cost). Orientation anchored early (maze/gardener intro). Minimal tightening—one cereus bloom prediction—lacks causal narrowing; vignette structure limits drive propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze specifics (emotion-shifting paths, marble junctions) filter through Elias's priorities, subtly guiding choices like placement spots. Recurring marbles constrain ritual and charge final embedding image. Sensory selection vivid/selective (leaves leaning, rustle sans wind); no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity vs. science) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cereus victory and scientist anticipation, forcing endurance with withering body cost felt in final walk. Agency in marble rituals narrows to transcendence path. No reversal harms quiet escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent connections emerges organically from marble mending and maze responses, culminating in non-literal final rustle/voice guidance reweighting measurement premise. Subtext in "mended deception" avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars like petal-crack marble.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (garden as knowing entity); diction/rhythm lyrical yet controlled, modulating to charged poise in closing whisper. Brief apprentice call natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via integrated ritual images; minor paraphrase loops (marble "character/beauty" restatements) dull mid-section without touching closure. No heavy artifacts; metaphors consistent (cracks as features).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable-luck era with emotional maze and cracked marbles transforms garden trope into ingenious proof-of-bond premise. Risky vignette pays off in CR without gimmickry; irreplaceable marble placements heighten stakes.</comment>
