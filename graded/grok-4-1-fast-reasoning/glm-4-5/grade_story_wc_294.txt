<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's perceptively calm response to Marcus reveals internal heritage conflict without therapy-speak. Earned endurance at closure via donation and departure shows prior micro-choices paying off. Limited on-page contradiction with Marcus keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through shards to CR closure: final realization reweights starting point with failure's cost. Mosaic pattern taught early via train office. Off-page startup unwind softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train as micro-setting constrains reflection and charges final "stepped away" image. Sensory details (peeling paint, cages-as-servers) mirror transformation. Recurrent currencies integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redefine legacy) accumulates texturally to endurance at bankruptcy. Marcus scene tightens pressure coherently under lens. Off-page falter lacks on-page option-narrowing for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of intention vs. heritage emerges via currencies/compass/map without statement. Final line ("less to do with our steps than... starting point") offers resonant CR repricing prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with biased perceptual signature on "territories." Dialogue subtextual (Elias's theft retort). Rhythmic modulation suits reflective mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("perceptively calm" x3, "dusky harmony" x3) creates minor paraphrase loops across reflective beats. Density strong, rhythm varies. No closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber's son, circus train startup, currency motifs transforms legacy trope organically. Risky mosaic shards heighten reflective stakes coherently.</comment>
