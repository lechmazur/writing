<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict in reluctance to lose humanity versus drive to reconnect, embodied in steady fingers amid heart tremor and root-growing feet; earned endurance as she transforms back unchanged yet with fuller heart. Minor abstraction in "cosmic intimacy" dilutes peak embodiment slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spice mixing to transformation to glyph-breath conjure builds density to Charged Poise RR closure in fading specter reunion with felt cost of impermanence ("you must walk through now"). Orientation anchored early in orchard post-phoenix; one tightening via completed metamorphosis suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard moonlight and spice scents selectively sensory, constrain via roots drinking soil and blooming response to call; recurring trees/moon charge final morning image. POV bias filters through Eliora's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reforge bond signals early, tightens via reluctant metamorphosis narrowing to temporary connection; agency in spice ritual forecloses permanent reunion with legible cost in fading mist. No reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent love emerges organically via spice-bridge and brother's "love transcends form," resonant in final unchanged-yet-transformed image without moralizing; fortune cookie reweights premise subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature in spice-song and glyph-breath; minimal dialogue distinct (her resonance vs. his wind-grass). Rhythm modulates to peak exhale without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion via sensory integration, but figurative density (eyes as "pools of night sky," breath glyphs) overwrites high-pressure transformation beat without full pattern payoff, dulling some immediacy; minor "whispers" repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie in fairy-tale spices/phoenix gateway transforms tropes; metamorphosis via roots/spices feels inevitable, risks bold cosmic scale without gimmick.</comment>
