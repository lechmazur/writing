<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between jocular mask and loneliness, embodied in voice cracking; motivation intensifies credibly to realization; minor summary of backstory dilutes peak choice pressure without full BRR anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with rumor density building to CR closure ("the cure...wasn't the rumor but the sharing"); cost legible in persistent anonymity; orientation anchored early in station; one meaningful tightening via spread success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station constrains secrecy and recurs to charge final image as "heart of an operation"; sensory details selective (cracked mirror, dawn through windows) mirror isolation; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through 67 channels to stance crystallization; agency in catalyzing rumor forecloses isolation path with felt hope/cost; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically from rumor-sharing success, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; final community image offers non-literal answer to loneliness question; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward connections (taxi network, rumor chains); rhythmic prose modulates from jocular to hopeful; minor indirection in self-talk; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("desperately jocular," "polite anarchy") taught early; minor paraphrase loops in rumor spread summary (−0.4); clean syntax, varied rhythm, no filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fake moon rock rumor catalyzing connection transforms reciprocity trope; risk in "polite anarchy" premise heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from pumice reveal.</comment>
