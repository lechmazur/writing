<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in synesthesia trait drives purposeful wandering and vow; embodied perception of sounds as colors particularizes interiority. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly wondrous curiosity without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously before revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as key's glow and warmth build density to Conceptual Repricing closure: librarian's "acknowledge" reweights premise, key dissolving into skin as legible conceptual cost in final pier image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken library's glowing books and porthole constrain revelation choice and charge final multicolored flames; sensory hierarchy (indigo waves early) mirrors lamplighter priorities, evolving with portal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (synesthesia origin) signaled early tightens via key's vibration pulling to door; agency in turning lock forces revelation trade-off, with vow foreclosing isolated endurance for communal sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sound-color as "language of light" emerges organically from book symphony matching lanterns; final flames offer resonant non-literal answer, reweighting gift from mystery to honored vow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (sounds as colors); dialogue subtext-laden, librarian's enigmatic smile advancing revelation without exposition. Minor: occasional elevated diction slightly drifts from lamplighter lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in revelation beat integrates sensory propulsion; rhythm varies with hush motifs. Minor overwrite: stacked light metaphors ("luminous vow of pure silver light") slightly muddle peak door turn without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia portal to sonic-color library transforms lighthouse trope; risk in magical realism (key reshaping) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via lamplighter heart.</comment>
