<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's ability to taste memories is embodied and particular, shown through tingling fingers and anticipated flavors like "his grandmother's bread," rooting his gentle rebellion. Internal conflict emerges in the gift/burden of synaptic plasticity and pruned relationships mirroring plant care. Minor flaw: reflective blocks slightly exceed BRR without always tilting present micro-choices, but motivation compels the planting decisively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from muttering to pruning to planting under alignment peak, tightening to Charged Poise CR in final image of "new spark of life." Orientation anchored early ("rusted greenhouse," Elias the chef). Closure cost legible in "even if only he ever tasted," foreclosing isolation path; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains via decay/renewal ("cracked glass panels," "holes" carrying jasmine/rust), mirroring internal stakes and charging final survey. Sensory hierarchy chef-specific (tastes memories, scents renewal). Greenhouse groans at peak, evolving with alignment light; micro-setting (soil, seed) shapes planting choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant seed for memory-rebellion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via alignment vibration and pruning pressure narrowing to defiant planting. Agency in kneeling/pressing seed forecloses inaction with felt isolation cost. One decisive deepening at "seed's consciousness connected"; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection via food/memories emerges organically from particulars like seed tasting "father's laughter," reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Subtext in decay/renewal images shifts from ruin to potential. Final image ("roots would spread... minds") offers non-literal resonance to rebellion question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with chef's perceptual signature (flavor-as-memory, rust/jasmine scents). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating to poetic intensity at planting; no head-hopping. Voice coherent, selectively biased to renewal amid decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in decay motifs ("ruins," "decay") and reflective stems slightly dull mid-section density. No closure artifacts; high info density in peak planting ("fingers tingling as the seed's consciousness connected"). Clean mechanics overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef ability and cosmic seed-planting transforms trope rebellion into memory-rooted CR. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via alignment clock without gimmick; irreplaceable "knowledge fruit seed" charges close uniquely.</comment>
