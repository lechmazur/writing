<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation roots deeply in her father's legacy versus her honesty, compelling micro-choices like duplicating the key; internal conflict embodies in trembling fingers steadied by the ink pot during the safe dial. Contradictory impulses act in the breach moment, earning her final renunciation of abuse with felt job risk cost. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "mathematics of a fair trade" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds: observation causally links to 2:17 AM breach (DC setup), culminating in CR closure via ink pot return reconfiguring deception into redemption with trust-breach cost legible in "breach the trust of her employer." Orientation anchors early in prep room. Smooth success lacks micro-turn but one tightening suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prep room's "quiet hum of refrigeration units, the chemical scent" sensory anchors constrain patrol timing and comfort choices; ink pot as micro-setting liquefies fear at safe, charging final reflective image. Funeral home mirrors death-to-life transition without overt symbolism. Professional bias filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (asylum forms vs job/charges) signaled early, tightens via guard routine pressure forcing precise timing; agency in active waiting narrows options with execution cost in duplicated key and safe tremble. Breach forecloses safe path, cost felt in "heavy" seal weight. Coheres under Hybrid lens without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive deception emerges via ink pot's shift from harm tool to truth enabler; final image non-literally answers honesty question by proving "honest path" through bent laws. Last line's direct "proving...honest path" borders moralizing but ties to particulars. Resonance from deathly vitality contrast avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: Maya's embalmer comfort biases "deathly vitality" noticing; rhythm modulates from reflective swirl to swift breach pace. No dialogue or head-hopping; inference matches knowledge like memorized combo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action with image, e.g., "fingers trembled slightly as she dialed" propels without loops; varied syntax accelerates breach. Minor repetition in ink pot "patterns" and "active waiting" paraphrase nudges down, but no closure dulling or artifacts in peak safe/stamp beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ink pot's subtle "liquefy rigid thinking" synthesizes con artist legacy with asylum forge organically; transforms tropes via funeral home's redemptive space and magical-realism aid without gimmick. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early setup; bold honesty calculus risks moral ambiguity.</comment>
