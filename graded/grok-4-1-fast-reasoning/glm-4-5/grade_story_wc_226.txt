<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to refract truth roots consistently in her mischievous defiance, intensifying to her final climb and poem with embodied resolve. Interiority shines in concrete whispers like "I am truth's reflection," revealing values under pressure. Minor weakness: sessions summarized without enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from dawn sessions to louder echoes, culminating in CR closure where canyon refracts her poem into liberating chorus. Orientation anchors early in canyon and spire. Pivotal tightening: overseers' attention forces tower climb, with felt cost of potential sacrifice legible in "whatever judgment awaited."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and endless echoes constrain and amplify poetry method, charging final image of refracted chorus. Sensory details like wind-whistling and mist integrate purposefully through Elara's biased gaze. Spire in mist recurs, mirroring internal defiance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refract truth before ritual—tightens via growing echoes and overseer shadows, narrowing to final poem under accumulative lens. Agency in sessions and climb forecloses conformity path with legible cost of freedom/life. No reversal overload; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of prismatic truth emerges organically from poetry echoes vs. singular spire, resonating in final chorus without moralizing. Subtext in mist as "listening spirits" invites ambiguity on absolutism. Minor slip: near-thematic echo in "truth cannot be contained" borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward refraction metaphors stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to echo intensity. Prose texture distinct in poetic diction like "words would reverberate like ghosts." No dialogue; elisions purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, but minor paraphrase loops in "singular truth"/"pale spire" repetitions dull density mid-story. Figurative language purposeful in echoes/refracting, no muddle at closure. High info density overall; scaffold minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-tower echoes as prismatic truth-refractor transforms absolutism trope organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
