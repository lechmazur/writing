<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to salvage purity drives diving to exposure with consistent traits; internal conflict in weaving truth without shattering visible in dream visitations. Embodied in warm globe vs. ocean chill. Minor summary of epiphanies slightly abstracts peak strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream fragments densify to pattern revealing sabotage, tightening to gentle exposures. Closure as Charged Poise in captain's "Thank you" whisper and glowing globe reconfigures connections with felt healing cost. Shard transitions anchored by globe; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and warm snow globe constrain ritual choices and charge final image; sensory details (flickering shadows, ice-forming voice) mirror internal states via whisperer bias. Vivid, selective integration into action elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to expose sabotage tightens accumulatively via dream analysis to descendant visitations, forcing gentle trade-offs; agency in weaving forecloses accusatory path. Cost legible in "shatter the living" risk and captain's peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pure truth across worlds emerges organically from globe conduit and dream fragments; final clear globe offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting lies to healing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (ghostly fragments as cameos); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from descent tension to charged poise, consistent idiom throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("borrowed starlight") integrated into propulsion; minor paraphrase in "salvage pure" refrain purposeful for theme. No loops; rhythm varies effectively in shrine scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving ghost whisperer with dream conduit transforms supernatural tropes; globe's evolution from melted relic to glowing bridge feels inevitable and risks bold tonal poise.</comment>
