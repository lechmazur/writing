<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "kindled humility" without embodied contradiction; motivation to strip drama is told rather than revealed through micro-choices under pressure, flattening emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure in final image of emerging butterfly reweighting worldview with humility cost; well-oriented early, no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse vividly anchors sensory decay/renewal, constraining observations and charging dust-galaxy parallel; recurring butterfly wing dust mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of perspective shift escalates accumulatively via daily observations, but lacks option-narrowing trade-off or agency-driven tightening; cost of abandoning research remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-renewal emerges organically from dust patterns and shoots; final butterfly offers resonant CR without moralizing, though "kindled humility" edges toward overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with pattern-seeing perceptual signature sustains accumulative texture; rhythmic modulation suits reflective tone, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "decay," "renewal," and "dust patterns" (e.g., repeated greenhouse descriptions) create synonym churn dulling propulsion; minor template cadence in observation lists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star patterns in butterfly dust transforms post-disaster renewal trope; specific cosmic/terrestrial links feel organic and inevitable in closure image.</comment>
