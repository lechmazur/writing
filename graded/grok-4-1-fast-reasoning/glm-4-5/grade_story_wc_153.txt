<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies convincingly from craving explanation ("not enough—not the apology") to earned compassion, with embodied tears and forehead press revealing contradictory impulses. Minor slip in diagnostic label-speak ("compassion for the fear") borders on unearned epiphany without deeper flaw exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: progressive revelations ("I'm sorry" → images → "I was afraid") tighten density toward Charged Poise closure in "I forgive," with felt emotional cost legible in final shard-glow image. Orientation anchored early in mangroves/moonlight; single scene coherent, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mangrove specifics (twisted roots, inky water, spirits' harmonies) selectively sensory and purposeful, mirroring internal states via songs of "unsent letters"; recurring window constrains evocation and charges closure image. Body/shard as micro-setting enable moonlight healing with tactile warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke unwritten message) signaled early, escalates via insufficient revelations forcing deeper focus, narrowing to forgiveness trade-off under accumulative lens. Cost felt in "fierce tenderness... compassion," charging final poise without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies emerges organically from condensation progression and spirits' translation, culminating in resonant "I forgive" without moralizing. Final image reweights "moment before deciding" via imagined reciprocity, embracing ambiguity of fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cryptic mysticism ("haunting melodies... words trapped in time"); rhythmic modulation builds to celebratory shift. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("singing spirits" x5, "fierce tenderness" echoes) creates minor template cadence in mid-beats, dulling density (−0.6); some paraphrase loops (motivation restatements). Peak closure image propels cleanly with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medium's ritual with condensation mechanics and shard-healing transforms ghost-story tropes into emotional bridge; mangrove/spirits feel particular and inevitable to forgiveness arc.</comment>
