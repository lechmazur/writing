<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to translate silence into music is rooted in his mother's legacy and embodied in hand gestures and eye crinkles, compelling higher-stakes choices as the crowd gathers; joyful sorrow acts as contradictory impulse throughout. Minor abstraction in "quiet charisma" feels slightly told rather than fully pressure-tested in pivotal woman encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mapped silences builds from woman to crowd to harbor-wide symphony; orientation anchored in opening harbor image; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final harmony image with legible cost of Elias's forgettability ("he would remain wordless himself in their memories").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlight on water and salt-tinged air selectively heighten sensory texture, mirroring Elias's hand movements in pivotal mapping beats; recurring harbor elements constrain his disruption by providing the silence he translates, charging final glowing response image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt/map silence into music) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as gestures grow intricate and crowd draws, narrowing to endurance of forgettability with felt cost in final lines; agency in sustained signing forces resonant crystallization under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-music and forgotten listener emerges organically from gesture patterns and final harbor song, offering non-literal resonant answer in "perfect harmony of joyful sorrow" that reweights prior mappings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (silence as threads/music); lyrical diction and rhythmic modulation suit accumulative intensity, modulating effectively in crowd-gathering escalation without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in gesture descriptions, but paraphrase loops ("mapping the silence," "joyful sorrow") across multiple adjacent sentences dull momentum in mid-climax crowd beat (−0.8); no closure harm, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sign language, filmless camera, and silence-mapping into fresh, inevitable frame where forgettability heightens stakes; risk-taking in Textural lyricism transforms tropes organically, with harbor reprise recharging opening.</comment>
