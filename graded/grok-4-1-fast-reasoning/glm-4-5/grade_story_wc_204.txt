<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eldon's motivation roots deeply in lost past, intensifying through trembling fingers placing the vial; final realization of dual preservation/destruction earns change with felt cost. Contradictory obsession drives micro-choices under pressure, embodied in stained fingers and awe at swirling words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost patterns build density to vial's destabilization and seventh-day implosion, yielding CR closure in "he had both preserved and destroyed his life's work" with legible conceptual cost of sanctuary's reform. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass branches and frost constrain via vial-induced warps, charging final image of reforming patterns; sensory details (rustling, vibrations, swirling words) filter through Eldon's cryptic gaze, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through wall ripples to rupture, forcing trade-off in library's destruction/reform; cost unmistakable in Eldon's touch of settling words amid cracking branches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge's preservation amid shifting reality emerges organically from vial's unbound expansion and library's awakening; final frost patterns offer resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting obsession's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shifting symbols and frost whispers; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing effectively at rupture ("eternity began compressing") without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures (golden leaves swirling); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, even in peak implosion—rhythm breathes with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost libraries into floating crystal orchard, transformed by vial's first-word echo and reality's negotiability; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in reform's charged poise.</comment>
