<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim battlefield is clear and rooted in unique traits like languages and bird understanding, compelling methodical actions; lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as competence dominates without visible flaws complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Oriented early via coachman, path, jetty; accumulative/textural lens builds density to CR closure in final garden image, reweighting narrow vastness with conceptual cost of decades and solitude legible in his smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty, twilight, barren battlefield vividly constrain path and actions, with seabird cries mirroring internal harmony quest; recurring jetty charges final return image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden reclamation signaled early tightens via bird-guided direction change and depleted pods by dawn, with exhaustion as felt cost; low opposition yields serene pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Healing through small acts emerges organically from seeding and future bloom; final wildflowers image resonantly reweights war-to-peace premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in decoding languages/birds; rhythmic prose modulates serene to hopeful, suiting accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Typo "ttk duelersi" and minor paraphrase loops in seed scattering/repetition dull propulsion; vivid rhythm mostly propels, but overwriting in descriptions reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-reef linguist-coachman using avian/dead-tongue guidance transforms healing trope; bird-shoulder directive feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
