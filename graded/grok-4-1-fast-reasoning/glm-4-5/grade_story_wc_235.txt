<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradictions like jealousy of past selves reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; interiority particular via dream chronicler lens. Final endurance of fractured mind earned by prior causal reflections. Minor epiphany abstraction in "cartographer of consciousness" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via symbols glowing to soaring, CR closure in final chronicle acceptance reweights timeline chaos with conceptual cost of perpetual newness. Orientation anchored early in cabin/scroll. No penalty as disorientation serves pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting cabin/scroll constrains choices (sanctuary/prison, tracing symbols triggers soar); recurring peaks charge final dawn image mirroring renewal. Sensory bias (pine, wild scent) POV-specific. Environment evolves with dream transparency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos post-grave) signaled early, textural escalation via glow/soar deepens to realization narrowing ignorance path. Agency in chronicling/soaring forecloses naivety with mind-fracture cost. Internal pressure coherent, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of birth/death dance emerges organically via grave vision to soaring lives unlived; final image non-literal answer reweights every moment as cradle/grave without moral. Resonance from particulars like upside-down snow. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (symbols dance, aurora weaves); rhythmic modulation peaks in soar. Compression purposeful/legible under textural lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful lyric patterns (dancing symbols, soaring corridors) taught early without muddle. Minor paraphrase in time confusion ("slippery, disjointed") but no loops touching closure. Propulsion aligns with dream cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream cartography with feral nostalgia transforms grave trope via timeline soar. Risky nonlinear perception heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious CR feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
