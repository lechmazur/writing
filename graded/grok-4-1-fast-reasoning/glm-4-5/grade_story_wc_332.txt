<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's loss drives consistent micro-choices like dawn photography and vitalizing, culminating in earned reconfiguration; interiority embodied in "tears blurred her vision." Minor reflective summaries dilute peak pressure but don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to book discovery ("The Language of Light and Longing") and symbol emergence into map; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in renewed "conversation" across worlds, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago and basement studio constrain rituals (easternmost point for dawn, secure library for predawn); recurring camera/palette charge final image of ongoing dialogue. Sensory light interplay mirrors longing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream/cipher) signaled early, deepens via book-informed photography yielding map; agency in feverish vitalizing forces realization trade-off. Felt cost legible in tears and foreclosed "chasing" path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via light emerges organically from vitalized photos and sister's essence; final image ("continue their conversation") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting absence to presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with light-biased perceptual signature ("luminous absence"); lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to feverish without slippage. Voice texture distinct, purposeful compression in rituals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; light motifs purposeful, not looped. Minor overwriting in opening ("world still held its breath") but no artifacts dull closure image of palette/camera readiness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical photography and dream-capture transforms loss trope; whispering islands and light-painting feel inevitable, risking surreal closure that heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
