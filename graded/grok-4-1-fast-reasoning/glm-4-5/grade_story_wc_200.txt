<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in sister's tragedy compels laughter integration, shown via bell choice at climax; Thomas's anxiety yields credible micro-turn to laughter. Minor flaw: "modestly fearless" told without contradictory impulse under cave confrontation pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tooth/harp tracking leads to cave confession, bell triggers DC (soul frees with joy crystallization). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure cost legible in "luminous ache" softening and Elias's burdened continuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's sonic distortions constrain pursuit tactics via harp notes signaling direction/emotion; sunrise shadows reach during trail, charging final cave image. Micro-setting (harp, tooth) shapes choices without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free 73-year soul) signaled early, tightens causally via tracking reversal to confrontation; agency in patient listening/bell peaks with felt cost (ache transformation foreclosing binding regret).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of confession+laughter healing emerges via particulars (drowning regret to crystallized laugh), final image reweights "incomplete" confession without moral; resonant non-literal answer in Thomas's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual bias (sonic attunement); dialogue natural/subtextual ("I'm afraid I'll forget how to laugh") advances goal. Minor register elevation in "luminous ache" phrasing fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with sensory propulsion (notes reveal direction); rhythm varies for pursuit build. Minor flaw: "luminous ache" paraphrase loop (three uses) dulls peak without payoff, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic ghost-hunting + laughter-healing transforms soul-collector trope; risk in sound-world rules pays off via harp distortions shaping causal turns. Inevitable hindsight in bell's joy crystallization.</comment>
