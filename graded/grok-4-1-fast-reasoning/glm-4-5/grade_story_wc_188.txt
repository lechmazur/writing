<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete skills like ambient awareness and embodied seriousness in the small smile while tracing the mosaic; motivation intensifies credibly to the tower performance. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from approach to discovery to climax; on-page RR closure via transformed fortress image ("gravity of hopelessness had been defied") with legible cost in burned rag. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming fortress and mosaic constrain choices (note discovery) and charge final image (pathways glowing new stories); sensory details filtered through Elias's priorities, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mosaic discovery tightening to performance; agency in sequential ignitions forecloses inaction with cost in consumed rag under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope reignited emerges organically from particulars like singing colors and responsive flowers; final image reconfigures darkness non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in "ambient awareness" and rhythmic chant integration; lyrical diction modulates purposefully to peak intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful figuratives like "purple that sang" enhance without muddling peak beats. Minor density slips in early descriptions, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks craft, mosaic code, and starless void transforms tropes into inevitable renewal image; risk-taking in synesthetic colors heightens stakes organically.</comment>
