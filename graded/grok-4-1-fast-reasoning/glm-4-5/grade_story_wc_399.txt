<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Embodied sensing via "peripheral awareness" grounds mystic traits effectively; isolation cost at "continuity with the past meant isolation" shows endurance but summarizes contradiction rather than simultaneous impulses acting in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to consecration peak ("murmuring...intensified...fell momentarily silent"); Charged Poise closure reconfigures duty as eternal with legible isolation cost; orientation anchored early in pavilion/prophet arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pavilion murmurs and kinetic parapet constrain ritual choices via responsive harmony; sensory hierarchy via peripheral bias vivid and selective; no object charges final image strongly enough for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant preservation stake signaled early; Accum lens cadence shift at silence peak reweights slightly, but no live option foreclosed or agency-tested complication narrows pressure viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of costly preservation emerges organically via ritual particulars; final "echo would never fade completely" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in isolation cost elevates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in peripheral noticing and rhythmic modulation during ritual build; stable close third-person; no dialogue to test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with ritual acceleration to peak silence; repetitive "peripheral awareness" (4x in consecration) and "strangely honest" create paraphrase loop dulling climax density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal "conjured clearings" and line walker transforms mystic trope organically; solo ritual risk heightens coherence without gimmick.</comment>
