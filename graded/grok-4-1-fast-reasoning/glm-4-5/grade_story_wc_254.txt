<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in poetic perception of shadows and hum but lacks contradictory impulses acting in the touch/paraphrase beat; motivation intensifies via tremor but epiphany feels summarized rather than earned through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from approach to glowing pillars/rippling lake; CR closure reconfigures boundaries as thresholds with legible conceptual cost in "kept them from this truth" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt stones and frozen lake mirror constrain slow approach and charge thaw image at end; sensory hierarchy (hum only aesthetically perceived, visual shadows) reflects POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access forbidden realms) signaled early and deepens via hum intensification/paraphrase to Charged Poise; agency in touch/speak forecloses confined path with felt past-ban cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending boundaries emerges from light/shadow interplay shifting to interconnection; final thawing lake offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in cloud-shadow noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipation to vibration sensation under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "dissolving boundaries" and synonym churn on shadows/light across atrium description dull mid-beats; figurative density coherent but heavy in transformation without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic fantasy via quartz hum and lake response transforms boundary trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
