<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to rekindle the realm intensifies through embodied actions like humming and swaddling, compelling higher-stakes work; interiority concrete in "scattered pieces draw closer," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light-weaving builds to CR closure in final weave and dawn spread, with conceptual cost of bound duty released in "keeper finally rested"; orientation anchored immediately at window/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flora and starlight saplings constrain choices (swaddling fragile ones) and charge final image (walls pulse, window reflects dawn); sensory selection vivid and POV-biased toward remembered light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via woven dawns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as urgency quickens steps and song strengthens, narrowing to final weave with legible cost in trembling hands and personal alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of restored connections emerges organically from particulars like gossamer threads and forgotten songs; final image of dawn spreading reweights premise without moralizing, offering resonant CR on community bonds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractured glass memories, pulsing flora); rhythmic prose modulates with urgency, e.g., shorter sentences in "moved faster now"; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in weaving beats; minor paraphrase loops on "scattered" memories and "knits" (twice) subtract without touching closure; rhythm varies purposefully, read-aloud strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-fabric in mirror-world orchard transforms tropes; risk in lyrical accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via starlight-to-dawn progression.</comment>
