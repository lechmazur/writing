<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via trembling hands and tears at visions; motivation to harvest insights drives ritual choices with embodied guilt; earned change in final renewal feels compelled by prior failure visions, though reflection borders BRR limit without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual setup to flute melody to visions builds density toward CR closure in tears and lighter flute; orientation anchored early at range's edge; cost legible in "washing away months of accumulated guilt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range's sound amplification constrains flute ritual and charges visions; driftwood from stream tactilely mirrors past moments; pearlescent air and glowing markers evolve with action, filtering through Eldrin's priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insights from failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via melody sequences revealing pride's blindness; agency in precise wood placement and playing forecloses ignorance with tearful cost; pressure coheres internally without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of failure-to-wisdom emerges via visions contrasting past pride with healing bridge; final "weave between worlds...for healing" reweights premise non-literally; ambiguity in transformation lingers authentically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward sound/silence; voice texture via "avalanchingly quiet" and rhythmic modulation builds lyric density; no head-hopping, diction fits introspective relic keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "canyon hush" and "gilded reed flute" repeats dull some propulsion (-0.4); high density in ritual beats with varied rhythm; no closure-touching artifacts, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-ritual redemption in echo range transforms relic trope; driftwood spiral as memory map risks bold ingenuity, charging closure organically without gimmick.</comment>
