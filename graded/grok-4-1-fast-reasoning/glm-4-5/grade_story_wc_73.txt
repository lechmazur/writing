<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait embodied in dice rolls and persistent climbing despite sighs, with chipped die revealing hesitation's internal conflict; final bet earns change via prior causality. Minor label-speak ("balancedly daring") slightly abstracts traits without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as proofs accumulate density to rupture (DC) with eternity's cost legible in "wisdom of eternity"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via completed proof, closure on-page without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains via symmetry/flaw and void, charging final dice image; selective sensory details (echoing boots, clicking dice) filter through Elias's math bias, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape purgatory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via proof nearing completion, agency in die placement/activation forecloses endless ascent with felt time cost; no high-band due to Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of regret-to-hope emerges organically via dice motif shifting from mockery to conquest, resonant non-literal answer in final roll reweighting infinite confinement; avoids morals, complexity in imperfect die.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with math-perceptual signature (tracing formulas, variables); rhythmic prose modulates tension, no head-hopping or withholding; capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("infinite staircase," "perpetual motion," "texture of his missed opportunity," "grim optimism") creates paraphrase loops and synonym churn across beats, dulling density; rhythm varies but artifacts touch escalation (proof descriptions). Minor template cadence in action stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of purgatory-as-math-puzzle with dice rupture transforms tropes; risk in nonlinear eternity-to-bar payoff inevitable from proofs/die constraint, no close template echoes.</comment>
