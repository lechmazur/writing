<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in thumb against carved letters and ribbon handling reveals meditative traits under grief's weight, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with serenity dominating over shown internal struggle; final carving earned via prior rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ribbon knots, butterfly patterns, and poem exchanges building density to CR closure in monument's completion and ribbon depletion as felt cost; orientation anchored early in greenhouse carving; retracing beat tightens purposefully without shards exceeding scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse dust motes, rattling panes, and dusk light constrain meditative focus and charge final image of amber wings against glass mirroring collective grief; sensory selection reflects Elias's priorities without tourist catalog; recurring granite and ribbon integrate tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping collective grief signaled early, escalates accumulatively via migration timeframe and retracing that narrows to ambitious monument; agency in unspooling ribbon forecloses individual focus with ribbon's depletion as visible cost charging villagers' thundering calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief transformation emerges organically through butterfly/ribbon patterns shifting from personal to collective without statement; final monument and mentor's words offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior rituals; avoids tidy morals via lingering ambiguity in villagers' response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of pattern-noticing (butterfly flight revealing grief's shape) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds meditative intensity without head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, prose as character in fiercely meditative phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "thundering calm" recurring purposefully; minor paraphrase loops in grief descriptors ("empty and overflowing," "individual sorrow and shared") dull peak slightly but don't obscure closure; rhythm varies read-aloud, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral guidance, and butterfly migration transforms grief tropes into collective pattern-making; ribbon's knots from poems offer ingenious non-obvious turn growing from rituals; bold meditative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
