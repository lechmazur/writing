<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Characterization strong in savvy micro-choices like flower code deployment and theft grace, earning the final reinterpretation as historian; interiority concrete via light-dance embodiment against skin. Minor flaw: "quietly savvy" label intrudes diagnostically early without full contradictory impulse under initial pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from bouquet code to theft to workshop reveal; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final arrangement where jar illuminates hidden messages, reconfiguring thief-to-preserver with conceptual cost of prior criminal path foreclosed. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene-to-shard transition legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerald station's glowing tiles and stationmaster's cluttered desk constrain theft access and timing; fleeting golden sunset to moonlight mirrors internal light quest, charging final workshop image. Sensory selection POV-biased toward luminous transitions without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete collection for destiny insight) signaled early, tightens via theft reversal then knowledge-deepening reveal under causal lens; agency peaks in graceful snatch and centerpiece placement, with felt cost in purpose reconfiguration charging closure. One meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving vs. stealing light emerges organically from heist particulars and jar-portrait interplay; final image offers non-literal resonant answer ("not a criminal but a historian") reweighting prior thefts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Luminous, perceptual voice stable in single POV with biased light-noticing signature; dialogue natural/subtextual in flower exchange advances plot via evasion. Rhythmic modulation fits pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (melted gold, liquid silver) propels without muddle; minor paraphrase loop in "luminous disbelief" repeats dulls peak reveal slightly. Varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm support momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of art heist with temporal light physics via moonbeam jar and flower codes transforms tropes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from portrait pattern, risking poetic fantasy payoff without gimmick.</comment>
