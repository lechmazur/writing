<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation clear in spiritual curiosity driving empathy with stars, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "flourishing stillness" without embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses; epiphany at "cosmic consciousness" feels unearned, lacking micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from routine tracking to meteor "call" tightening insight; orientation anchored early in station and role; CR closure lands via transformed return with glass pulsing knowledge, cost felt in "forever changed" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful—station dome, void, debris constrain observation and step into uncharted; recurring glass as micro-setting charges final glow; sensory hierarchy cosmic/visual biases Elion's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cosmic connection signaled early, tightens accumulatively at meteor invitation narrowing to void venture; agency in abandoning instruments shows endurance with vulnerability cost, but stakes abstract without visceral on-page reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-to-strength emerges organically via star empathy and void, resonant in final "eternal dance"; weakened by direct statements like "strength in vulnerability" echoing thesis, risking moralizing over implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cosmic empathy; voice rhythmic and modulated, diction purposeful (e.g., "ethereal痕迹"); no head-hopping, compression lyric-appropriate under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "vulnerability" and "transformation" (e.g., repeated star rebirth phrasing) dull some propulsion; no closure harm, metaphors coherent in cosmic pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor role with empathic glass transforms cosmic tropes into spiritual arc; risk in abstract lyricism pays off in inevitable CR, memorable via "stardust witnessing the stars."</comment>
