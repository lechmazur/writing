<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in regret and redemption, with micro-choices like etching symbols revealing hierarchy of values; interiority concrete via "luminous regret settling over him like the foundry's perpetual mist." Minor epiphanic tidy-up in final realization slightly undercuts contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from acceptance of loss to forging; clear on-page CR closure in retrieving the imperfect coin, cost legible in "more beautiful for its flaws." Orientation anchored early in foundry post-search; one tightening via decision to create suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry vividly constrains choices (crucibles, molds for alchemy) and charges final image ("rain-washed surfaces reflected its newfound glow"); sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, details evolve causally with furnace rekindling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem failure via new coin) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through etching/forging process narrowing to imperfect wisdom; agency in creation, cost felt in foreclosed original replacement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of names' weight and kintsugi redemption emerges organically from etching names and golden mending; final image reweights failure without stating moral. Slight thematic echo in "turning regret into luminous purpose" borders redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystical filtering like "steam rising... ghostly sigh"); rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "rain-washed" (4x) and "luminous regret" loops create paraphrase churn, dulling density in opening; strong propulsion elsewhere, but artifacts cap high band. Metaphors consistent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zodiac alchemy and kintsugi transforms loss trope into "redemption through limitation"; forging scene feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
