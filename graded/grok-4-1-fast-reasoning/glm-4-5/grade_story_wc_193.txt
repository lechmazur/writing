<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in pyramid survival compels risky solo shift and digging; embodied in "virtuously mischievous gleam" and tears at diamonds' formation. Internal conflict between scam wariness and curiosity acts in dismissing then pursuing texts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: glitchy texts ("BELOW THE THIRD TERRACE") propel descent to bolt discovery and pressure-plate climax, landing DC closure via glittering diamonds with redemption cost legible in final tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow and purple mushrooms constrain navigation ("slippery walkways") and guide terrace dig; spores and instability pressure choices, charging diamond display in bioluminescent light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to claim quantum promise escalates via texts' impossible knowledge to unstable descent; agency in volunteering, digging, and placing bolt forecloses scam-haunted past with felt tears at transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure-to-diamonds theme emerges organically from past ruin, texts, and climax act; resonant in "guardian of a miracle" without overt moralizing, though final summary edges thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in glowing "shadowseam wonder"; diction modulates from serene to thrilling, consistent under pressure without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory rhythm propels, but "glowed/glowing" loops across dig/climax dull propulsion; minor paraphrase in transformation lines ("quantum promise thrumming...unfolded") adds scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid scam survival with quantum bolt in mushroom farm transforms pressure metaphor into literal miracle, risking magical realism payoff at diamond climax.</comment>
