<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in father's contrast propel her nurturing choices; senseless perceptiveness shown through plant details yields micro-choices with endurance cost. Subtle internal conflict (hunter instincts sheathed) acts in scene without alternating summaries. Minor summary of traits slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors dome/who/when; density builds to Charged Poise closure in sheathing shears, reconfiguring chaos vs renewal with conceptual cost of world's unraveling legible in final image. Single scene fits defaults; no orientation debt. Lens taught early via reflective texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain choices (humidity shifts, thorny protection) and charge final image of oasis amid chaos; sensory details (condensation breathing, vibrations) filtered through her perceptual bias mirror internal tranquility. Micro-setting (airship scrap) evolves tactilely. Recurrent roses reweight survival theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity post-tower) signaled early; accumulative deepening via plant inculcation narrows to resilience focus, forcing endurance trade-off with felt cost of chaos in final knowing. No reversal but cadence shift suffices under lens; stakes viscerally tied to embodied work yet lack on-page test beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-nurture emerges organically from rose values and sandbag repurposing; final image offers non-literal resonance repricing hunter legacy without moralizing. Particulars (impossible hues, engraved quiet) build complexity with ambiguity of world's healing. Minor platitude risk in "thread of meaning" but anchored in actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (plant whispers, vibrations) biases details character-specifically; rhythmic prose modulates from meditative to charged poise without drift. No dialogue; voice texture distinct in syntax evoking quiet intensity. Clean psychic distance tightens under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid specificity (weathered canvas, drooping stems) propels accumulatively; rhythm varies for meditative cadence. Minor paraphrase loops (chaos/reign motifs restated adjacently) and occasional elevated diction (inculcating, senselessly perceptive) dull ~10% of beats without touching closure. No filter stacks or template runs; read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical value-imprinting in post-tower world transforms pacifist-heir trope via engraved quiet and sandbag evolution; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight through resilient roses; no derivative echoes.</comment>
