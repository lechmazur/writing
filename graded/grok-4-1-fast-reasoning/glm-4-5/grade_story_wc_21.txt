<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in archival obsession, with embodied visions like "searing reverie of teargas" driving micro-choices to the lagoon; earned transformation from collector to history-maker, but minor label-speak ("solemn civil-rights archivist") slightly genericizes voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from diary visions to lagoon parley, delivering CR closure in "new text where once was code" with conceptual cost of ongoing temporal bridge; orientation anchored early in zeppelin library, one tightening via debris messages suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "airship engines hummed beneath polished oak" and "waves lapped against her boots" constrain choices (lagoon as reflecting pool) and charge final sunset image; POV-filtered through archival bias, no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of temporal entrapment signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying visions and debris arrangement forcing stance crystallization; agency in kneeling to spell questions yields felt cost in "fingers trembled as new knowledge flooded," charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of generational healing emerges organically from diary-lagoon bridge without statement; resonant CR in publishing "unvarnished history" reweights premise with complexity cost, lingering ambiguity in "wounds that still bled."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (temporal/archival diction like "chromatic memories"); rhythmic modulation under stress, purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor paraphrase loops ("obsidian lagoon" repetition) and synonym churn ("truth in tension") dull peak debris beat slightly (−0.6); no closure artifacts, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, zeppelin archive, and beach temporalism transforms tropes organically; risk in nonlinear visions pays off in lagoon reconfiguration, no derivative echoes.</comment>
