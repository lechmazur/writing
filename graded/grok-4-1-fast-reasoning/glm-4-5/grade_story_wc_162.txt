<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her father's mazes and lost connection, with micro-choices like tracing wood grain revealing contradictory longing and determination. Interiority feels embodied in light, dust-mote movements. Minor slip: father's voice delivers unearned epiphany without prior relational friction shown on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from logbook intuitions to oak doorway convergence, yielding CR closure when symbols form "Home" with emotional cost of crossed distances legible. Orientation anchors early in terrace navigation. Single scene fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace, fractured hush, and oak grain constrain choices vividly—e.g., grain pattern matches logbook, charging final doorway image. Sensory hierarchy (hush thickening like water) reflects urgency; details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred thresholds/home) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening intuitions and buzzing energy at doorway, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in touching grain pays with revelation; cost felt in grief/regret convergence. Minor abstractness in early stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformative thresholds emerges organically from particulars like logbook and wood patterns, resonating in reunion without overt moralizing. Father's line ("journey out is always also the journey in") borders echo but ties to prior motifs. Final image reweights separation-to-love with ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, with perceptual signature in prismatic, hush-filtered noticing; diction/rhythm modulates from drifting waves to rustling corn closure. Late dialogue natural, subtext-rich; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but "featherly determination" and "necessary distances" loops (4+ repeats) create minor paraphrase drag without full pattern payoff. Metaphors coherent (dust motes, river canyons); closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of corn mazes, butterfly-shifted realms, and logbook runes transforms loss trope into inevitable geometric homecoming. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
