<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in the opening chest-tightening shiver versus the planned ascent; claustrophobia compels higher-stakes micro-choices like placing the doll as sentinel, earning the healing closure with visible psychological cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered silences building to gilded hush CR, with on-page cost in reluctant descent ("felt herself beginning to sprout new awareness"); orientation anchored early in bunker hallway, one tightening at trellis arrival reweights options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Xenial trellis bells "chimed without audible sound" constrain collection via vibration felt in bones; recurring doll and vessel as micro-settings charge final image, sensory tastes of silences filter through POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest gilded hush tightens via inversion hour and ascent layers under Accumulative lens, agency in limiting exposure forecloses ordinary noise; cost legible in "yearning to expand beyond her claustrophobic confines and fearing what might lie beyond."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of confinement-transcendence emerges organically from silence flavors shifting to honey-light hush; final doll-vessel image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting underground terror without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in silence tastes (metallic father vs. gilded hush); rhythmic modulation peaks at "luminous flowers with fragile bells," no head-hopping, diction fits child's lyrical wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in ascent layers advances texture without loops; purposeful repetition of "silence" patterns accumulative drive, varied rhythm breathes with inversion ("rising slowly like a seedling"); minor register elevation in "intangibly tangible" uncharged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence flavors, gravity inversion, xenial trellis transforms confinement tropes; risk-taking in tasting hush ("honey and light") feels inevitable, heightens stakes via irreplaceable conceptual integrity.</comment>
