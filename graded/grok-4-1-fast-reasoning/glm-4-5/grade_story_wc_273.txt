<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tracker's serene anger embodies contradictory impulses (calm demeanor fueling wild isolation), compelling the ink-step with childhood-rooted motivation; final awe-tremor earns change via embodied distress post-disappearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns build density to disappearance/reappearance CR, with cost in vitals fluctuation; orientation anchored immediately in encampment post-eclipse; one tightening at ink-flare suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment constrains choice (magnifies anomalies, stone shelter for experiment) and charges final wind-whisper image mirroring realization; sensory selectivity (scent of rain, shadows) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock time distortion) signaled early, tightens via disappearance turning abstract theory visceral; agency in stepping into ink forecloses normal perception with on-page cost (gasping, fluctuations).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual time-shift emerges organically from ink patterns and crisis-experience; final whisper ("Time doesn't slow...") offers non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (albinism-heightened anomalies); voice texture distinct in syntax evoking wild serenity; drone commands natural, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("serene anger" motif overused without full payoff) and occasional elevated diction slightly dull peak ink-flare beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink-pattern temporal displacement synthesizes fresh alchemy-science angle, transformed via albino perception; risk in crisis-disappearance heightens stakes organically to CR.</comment>
