<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleth's motivation to preserve intensifies credibly from disturbance to restoration, embodied in "heart clenched with foxglove regret" at crack discovery; micro-choices like cradling the tube reveal values. Internal conflict harmonious rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits depth. Earned emotional release at harmony with felt cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery density builds to restoration; orientation anchored early in opal library routine. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in chimes voicing "Xylos. Thalia. Maran." amid "they too might fade," with undeniable conceptual cost of preservation's temporality. Single tightening via repair suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchids and phonograph constrain tactics in preservation chamber, charging final image of blooming "tiny glass orchids" in heart. Sensory details like "petals capturing...rainbows" filtered through Eleth's priorities integrate vividly without stalls. Atmosphere mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten sounds signaled early, deepens accumulatively through ritual repair narrowing silence to harmony under textural lens. Agency in positioning "radiant beam" forces trade-off with impermanence cost legible in post-restoration test. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, felt in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation against forgetting emerges organically from ritual and images like "melodies evaporated like dew"; final chimes and mist reweight premise non-literally. Foxglove regret threads subtext without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical texture in syntax like "notes colliding like dust motes"; perceptual signature reverent toward fragilities. No head-hopping or withholding; diction modulates with intensity purposefully. Voice coherence elevates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "light summoned by the echo...transforming sound into visible radiance" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies naturally. Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "glass-orchid caretaker" phrasing slightly dull non-peak beats, but no closure touch or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of extinct feelings museum, song-to-light repair, and thought-breezes transforms preservation trope into fresh inevitability. Risky lyric fantasy commits fully, heightening stakes via irreplaceable conceptual logic. No derivative echoes.</comment>
