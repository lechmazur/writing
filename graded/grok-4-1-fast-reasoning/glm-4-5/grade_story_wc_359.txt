<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic perception particularizes interiority vividly (e.g., indigo as navy wave), rooting motivation in traits; lacks contradictory impulses or flaws acting simultaneously under pressure, yielding smooth competence without micro-choice tests.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory density building to conceptual repricing closure—"sculpted hush unfurled like a lotus, revealing not absence but presence"—with legible conceptual cost in proving wonder essential amid tears; single scene oriented early, one tightening at final chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (crystalline ceiling filters aurora hues guiding strikes, ice echoes notes) constrains actions and mirrors synesthetic states; cavern micro-setting charges final white light image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) signaled early under accumulative lens with density increase to hush; lacks reversal or option-narrowing turn—success assured without trade-off or agency test foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's necessity emerges organically via hush transforming silence into presence, final lotus image offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (colors singing melodies) and purposeful lyrical rhythm modulating intensity; diction controlled, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short crystalline breaths amid flowing descriptions), high density; figurative density overwrites climax ringing ("rippled... cascade... flowing dance"), mixed vehicles slightly blurring propulsion without loop scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, prism bells, and sculpted hush transforms silence trope into perceptual revelation; conceptual integrity commits to aurora-guided performance yielding inevitable hush legacy.</comment>
