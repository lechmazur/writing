<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as guardian via prediction, rooted in past successes like landslide save; interiority concrete in visualizing data points. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with reflective summaries dominating over micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance of vigilance feels earned but lacks visible cost on page beyond general community stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patterns/cracks to pen touching page; Charged Poise closure in "final stroke completed, she held up the map," reconfiguring options with felt time constraint cost legible in cracks and migration need. Single scene anchored early ("Elara stood at the apex of the obsidian spire"); no orientation debt. One tightening via confirmed cracks narrows adaptation path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain via amplification and predictive confirmation (cracks "along what her calculations had predicted"), charging final image of map in light. Sensory hierarchy cartographer-specific: ice patterns over generics. Spatial coherence strong, details woven into perception without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival via prediction) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with cracks confirming melt, forcing precise westward migration choice. Agency in steadying hand and drawing; cost felt in "limited time to transform." No reversal but deepening reweights via on-page evidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of ongoing transformation via prediction emerges organically from particulars like quill/data visualization; final map image offers resonant non-literal answer to skepticism vs. proof. Subtext in "prediction without time... merely tragedy" avoids moralizing. Minor drift to abstract "sustaining transformation" summaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern/data focus; diction purposeful, modulating reflective to poised ("took a deep breath, steadying her hand"). No dialogue; rhythmic control good but some syntactic similarity in reflections. Inference matches knowledge, no withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "predictive modeling"/"transformation" (e.g., repeated "predictive models had detected shifts... patterns none else could perceive") dull density across reflections; template cadence in "She had [past achievement]" stems. Closure image clear but artifacts touch final third. Propulsion varies but hedging in redundancies slows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" premise fresh, synthesizing data/prophecy organically; transforms prediction trope via grounded modeling on spire. Risk in mystic-yet-rigorous frame heightens stakes without gimmick. No close echoes, voice authentic.</comment>
