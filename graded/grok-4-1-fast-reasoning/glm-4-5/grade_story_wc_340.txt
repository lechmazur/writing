<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and embodied emotion (goggles cold on skin); motivation rooted in "quiet mission" compels micro-choices like angling light; earned realization at floor ten forecloses judgment with felt cost of preservation, though epiphany borders tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via floor-by-floor density build to CR closure (decrypted script reconfigures captain's duality with conceptual cost of tender secrecy); orientation anchored early (elevator ascent); structure taught by chimes tightens to charged poise on observation deck.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice crystals mirroring code and scattered light constrain decryption choice at floor nine; vivid sensory hierarchy (crystalline walls fracturing light) reflects POV priorities; spire's isolation charges final image of endless sky against hidden earth-love.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt to uncover joy/anguish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed attempts to floor-nine inspiration narrowing options; agency in goggles/light use yields on-page cost (promise to preserve dignity foreclosing disclosure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of concealed joy/anguish emerges organically from diary reveal reweighting stern facade; final image (replacing diary, adjusting uniform) offers non-literal resonance on detachment/affection without moralizing; counter-reading lingers in duty's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (inquisitive light-pattern noticing); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity to closure; purposeful compression in floor beats fits accumulative lens without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel ascent, but minor paraphrase loops in ending reflections ("unfold...unfolding", "joy and anguish") and "化作" artifact dull final image; overwriting in metaphors consistent yet thickens peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh elevator-as-beats structure transforms diary trope via goggles/light decryption; risk in lyric ascent heightens emotional specificity without gimmick; synthesis of skies/earth love feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
