<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in regret and chronological confusion drives resolute choices like fitting the wheel and negotiating; interiority concrete in trembling hands and eroded ambitions. Weakness: contradictory impulses summarized ("profoundly chronologically confused") rather than acting simultaneously in pivotal wheel-fitting beat, limiting 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments gather into bridge (causal linkage via wheel), culminating in on-page RR (wheel-ghost merger with forgiveness cost legible in "sorrowful expression"). Orientation anchored early (Cyrus sifting lagoon debris); single scene fits defaults, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (iridescent debris, thick air) filters through scavenger bias, constraining choices (lagoon edge approach, word-bridge walk). Micro-setting via wheel harness charges final merger image; purposeful over postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost to heal ambitions) signaled early, tightens via wheel-powered images/bridge forcing center confrontation under Accumulative lens. Escalation agency-driven (Cyrus steps onto words), cost felt in ghost's resentment shift; entering 8+ via trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions emerge organically from ghost mirror and merger, reweighting regret via final "liquid peace" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (story fragments to bridge); ambiguity lingers in "unforeseeable new beginnings."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (time-warped scavenger noticing story fragments, worn teeth); rhythmic modulation builds to peak ("satisfying snap"). Dialogue sparse but goal-driven ("I am finally ready"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative overlays ("celestial carousel," "silt at the bottom," "bridge of words") in high-pressure bridge/approach beat obscure propulsion (-0.6); minor paraphrase loops ("shimmered," "shimmering" repetition). Density functional but risks overwriting at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-lagoon scavenging and ghost negotiation transforms tropes via camera wheel's temporal lens; risk-taking in word-bridge payoff feels inevitable. Non-obvious premise elevates beyond fantasy template.</comment>
