<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archivist's contradictory impulses—nervous backward pacing vs. steady mentoring—embody resilience teaching, earning Prisha's pivotal stance change; her micro-choice at door creak reveals absorbed growth with visible cost to his exile isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern density building from shard prep to shadow-tea intersection, landing Charged Poise closure in Prisha's grounded annotation amid lengthening shadows; orientation anchored early, one tightening via dancing shadow suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library micro-setting constrains via narrow aisles, dust, and shadows that intersect tea leaves to reveal patterns, charging Prisha's first annotation; recurring playground swing mirrors endurance, filtering through archivist's peripheral vision bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quiet resilience mentoring tightens accumulatively through shadow's intersection forcing pattern revelation and door creak testing Prisha's stance; her endurance forecloses backward retreat with felt mentor-cost in permanent exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of exile preserving resilience emerges organically via shard demonstration and Prisha's contrast to archivist's habit, resonating in final smile without statement; playground swing reprise reweights separation motif non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with archivist's perceptual signature (peripheral shadows, backward paths) modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtext advances via correction ("Not enter exactly") pursuing mentoring goal naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via varied openings and sensory integration (echoing footsteps, trembling shard); minor figurative density in opening shadows purposeful without muddle, though "combative tenderness" edges label-speak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard-tea geometry synthesis transforms memory annotation into fresh reversible exile craft, risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes via shadow dance without gimmick; inevitable in Prisha's earned stand.</comment>
