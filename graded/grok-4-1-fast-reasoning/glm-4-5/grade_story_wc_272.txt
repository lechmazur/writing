<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (fingers smudging charcoal into bones' sadness) and earned change via thread-untangling compel redesign; contradictory sadness vs. descent urge acts in scene. Rhetorical questions occasionally border therapy-speak without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box discovery to thread-sorting, culminating in CR closure ("luminescent ache remained, but now it felt like inspiration") reweighting fragments with persistent pain cost legible in final portrait image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circular library walls constrain thoughts/actions (closing in, then breathing/embracing), dust motes and candle shadows mirror internal fragmentation; box/threads as micro-setting charge final "broken tarot box no longer seemed broken" reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost artistic spark) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via untangling to steadier hand/redesign; agency in methodical sorting forecloses perfection ideal with felt cost (stained fingers, enduring ache).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented reality as artistic essence emerges organically via threads/cards; final "portrait was complete... truth revealed by untangling" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature (shifting cards, threads as self-aspects); voice modulates rhythmically from ache to charged poise, diction purposeful for accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm integrates action/metaphor propulsion; minor opening figurative density ("cloying sadness... luminescent ache") purposeful but risks slight overwrite without coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tarot box with puppet-threads synthesizes artist-block trope into fresh, inevitable renewal; risk-taking in metaphorical descent heightens stakes organically.</comment>
