<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to restore the covenant drives ritual choices effectively, but epiphany at the maze center ("Immediately, the visionary understood") arrives without sufficient embodied contradiction or struggle, muting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ritual deepening from clipping glow to maze entry and scar-linking; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in reconfigured covenant harmony, felt in emergence and lifted burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and maze clipping as micro-setting constrain ritual entry and charge final emergence image; blue light pathways evolve purposefully, mirroring internal merge without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find dream intersection tightens accumulatively via scar-linking and core touch; agency in stepping into maze forces trade-off, with terrifying/exhilarating cost legible before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dream/reality harmony emerges organically from ritual particulars; final image of smile and purpose offers resonant non-literal reweighting of separation premise, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close POV with perceptual bias toward blue-tinged wonder; rhythmic texture modulates anxiety to elation purposefully, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel ritual beats; minor paraphrase loops ("anxious elation" x2, "purposefully" x2) dull propulsion slightly without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-linking ritual and dream-maze premise transforms fantasy tropes; risk in shrinking/entry heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
