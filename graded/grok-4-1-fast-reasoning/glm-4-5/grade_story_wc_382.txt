<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to decode buildings' language roots consistently in intuitive observations, intensifying via rooftop interrogation where hesitation yields articulated inheritance insight. Mr. Abernathy's grace and emotional reveal force relational shift with earned cost of rediscovered heritage. Minor abstraction in "memory and intuition combined" slightly dilutes embodied contradiction at pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ritual teas building to rooftop CR: heritage realization reweights premise with conceptual cost of protective lies ("some truths need...falsehoods"). Mosaic shards taught early ("weekly ritual") with legible transitions; one tightening suffices. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seal as recurring object charges final image, constraining recognition ("symbols identical") and handover. Rooftop garden/meteors pressure revelation, sensory hierarchy (glowing seal in meteoric light) mirrors dawning fluency. Historic district details filter via Clara's bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn buildings' speech) signaled early, accumulates density to rooftop deepening: blood tie narrows to inheritance, forcing acceptance with lie-cost legibility. Agency in pursuit/possession; one cadence shift reweights under accum lens. No reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden inheritance emerges via seal-symbols, rooftop symbols-to-blood shift offers non-literal resonance: stories "ready to be told" reweights secrecy without moral. Subtext in lies protects complexity; final image charges without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Clara POV with perceptual signature (buildings' familiarity). Dialogue subtextual ("the key"), distinct idiom (elderly grace vs. Clara's observations). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at dawn descent; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull closure (final seal possession clean). Selective telling compresses backstory efficiently. Minor familiarity-repetition contained, no peak artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dead languages decode literal buildings' "speech" as blood heritage, rooftop meteors ingeniously illuminate symbols-to-kin turn. Tropes (mysterious elder) transformed via shared lineage; risk in mosaic time jumps coheres.</comment>
