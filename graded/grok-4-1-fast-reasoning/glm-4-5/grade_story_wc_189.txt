<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied via the jade cicada's warmth and hand gesture during the pause, rooting her motivation in consistent traits. Internal conflict emerges in the funding tension, with micro-choices like tangential observation revealing values. Epiphany borders unearned rationalization without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pool reflections, cicada pulses, and ancestral echoes builds to CR closure in Maya's resolve during the pause, reweighting funding as transition with felt cost of embracing uncertainty. Single scene oriented early (grotto, Aris's question). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tidal pools and star reflections selectively mirror internal transitions, constraining realization via tangible analogy in the pause. Grotto atmosphere evolves with conversation resumption, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy fits POV's observant bias; spatial coherence clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (funding scarcity) signaled early, tightens texturally via pause-deepening that reframes limitations as opportunity, narrowing direct confrontation. Agency in insight forecloses old approach with legible cost in "uncertainties as essential." Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture in transitions emerges organically from pool patterns and cicada metamorphosis, resonating in final conversation shift without moralizing. Subtext in pause silences invites ambiguity on adaptation. Earned via particulars, reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tangential observations; voice modulates rhythmically from pause reflection to dialogue resumption. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (observations over direct funding answer). Minor register elevation in epiphanic lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops on "transition periods" and "texture of time" (e.g., multiple sentences in realization block restate insight without new pressure), with synonym churn and template cadence dulling density. Figurative overkill in reflective beats obscures propulsion. Closure image intact but momentum drags mid-story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal ecology and temporal philosophy via cicada heirloom transforms epiphany trope into textured lineage. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at pause clarity. Organic, non-obvious angle on funding pivot.</comment>
