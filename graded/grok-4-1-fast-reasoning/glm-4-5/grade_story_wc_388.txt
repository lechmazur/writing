<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to debunk lies roots consistent traits and compels investigation, with final keeper choice earned via discoveries; interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion solid in raw fingers and warmth from diamond touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations/clues builds knowledge to CR closure ("She would become the keeper"), with cost legible in corporate risk and diamond touch; one tightening via letter reassembly suffices, no orientation debt past 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (gnarled bark, glowing soil, bending trees) constrain choices (toxic soil brushed, storm barrier); charges final image of thriving orchard amid raging storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover/protect truth) signaled early, deepens via letter intuition narrowing options to resistance; agency in reassembly/touch forecloses exposure path with felt cost (raw fingers, liquidation threat).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth amid deception emerges organically from particulars (flawed diamond as key); final image resonates but closing lines ("Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn't liquidate") verge on moralizing echo, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (observant eyes noting details); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, diction purposeful in wasteland idiom; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("sharply observant" x3, "reassembling shredded letters" looped twice verbatim) creates paraphrase churn dulling density; template cadence in discovery beats ("The letters spoke... began to intuit"); minor filter stacks but propulsion holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc tropes via stillpoint/diamond conduit transforms corporate purge into dimensional cover-up; risk in quiet hope closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
