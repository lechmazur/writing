<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in sister's failure compel the infusing choices with embodied emotion; contradictory redemption drive shows in perceiving specific memories like apples and rain. Final preservation earns stasis without tidy epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous impulses acting caps below peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through ritual build to Charged Poise closure: emerald withdrawn and stored, pattern complete with sister's felt cost legible in "failed to save her sister." Orientation anchors immediately in grotto. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora and crystalline walls constrain/amplify connection, charging final image of next pattern emerging; sensory details like orchard scent and warm chip filter through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog. Evolving environment mirrors internal weave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing spark tightens accumulatively as pattern clarifies and infusion succeeds, narrowing to completion with personal redemption cost. Agency in conduit role drives one decisive deepening. Entry to high band via on-page trade-off feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving stories emerges organically from memory infusion to final "catch the emerald sparks," reweighting loss with resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing redemption lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "patterns in static" noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to pulsing intensity. Voice particular and biased toward ethereal energies without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "pattern" repetitions ("pattern grew clearer... pattern complete... pattern of the next journey") dull propulsion slightly in peak infusion beat. No closure harm or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician ritual with emerald memory-capture in skyborne grotto transforms preservation trope; risk in lucid fantasy logic heightens stakes inevitably toward closure image.</comment>
