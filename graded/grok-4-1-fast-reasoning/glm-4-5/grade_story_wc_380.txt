<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in brother's erased memories compels ritualistic micro-choices like coffee swirling and digging; embodied tears at crystal's images earn final bridge-building stance without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from coffee patterns to gravity-guided dig, landing CR closure in reburial with conceptual cost of visitation over reclamation; "sand grew resistant" tightens pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt crystals as micro-setting amplify gravity and mirror neural pathways, constraining workshop prep and charging crystal discovery; recurring lanterns bookend with dawn mingling, recharging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery escalates accumulatively via intensified fluctuations and resistant sand to crystal payoff; agency in exhuming forecloses full reclamation, with cost felt in reburial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over loss emerges organically from whale-crystal-brother synthesis; final "brother's presence as clearly as if he stood beside her" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward gravity rituals yields distinct texture ("frozen light," "facets catching lantern light in ways that defied normal physics"); voice modulates to hopeful cadence at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-thought without loops; purposeful "gleaming silence" refrain builds rhythm, though minor register elevation in peaks avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity-archives, coffee cartomancy, and whale trigger transforms memory-loss trope; risk in cosmic premise commits fully, heightening stakes via irreplaceable crystal payoff.</comment>
