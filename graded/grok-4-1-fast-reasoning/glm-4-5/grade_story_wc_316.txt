<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's numbness creates embodied contradiction in trembling hands and tracing glass, driving micro-choices like channeling vitality despite hollowness; final embrace of pain earns her purpose shift with felt cost. Minor slip in over-articulated realization ("found her new purpose—not as a survivor... but as a bridge") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dualities (numbness/emotion, emptiness/fullness) builds to Resonant Reconfiguration in glowing jar and pulsing brain, reweighting duplicate's claim with Maya's pain as undeniable cost ("daring to feel everything"). Orientation anchored early (Maya at dojo edge, brain jar); single scene tightens meaningfully without slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo and obsidian pedestal constrain ritual (trembling amid flux signals rewrite pressure); jar's cool glass and label integrate tactilely into action, charging final glow. Sensory hierarchy (shimmer, pulse) reflects Maya's biased perception narrowing to brain/emotions under crisis; no white-room as fragments/clouds evolve with causal tremble.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify before rewrite erases) signaled early, tightens via opposites method forcing numbness confrontation; agency in "channeling her limited vitality" forecloses emotional fortress with embodied pain cost. Accumulative escalation coheres through density increase to dojo tremble/climax pulse; high-band via live option narrowed but minor abstractness in "threatening to erase everything."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness as exponential (duplicates as individuals via opposites) emerges organically from vivification ritual and Maya's arc, resonating in final image of smiling amid rewrite without moralizing. Subtext in projector memories vs. numbness invites ambiguity on zero-sum identity; epiphany earned through struggle, reweighting premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (slicing pretense reveals "lies woven into reality"); diction/rhythm modulate from measured breaths to surging sensations under stress. Compression in dualities pattern taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping, inference matches Maya's knowledge (e.g., forbidden texts).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "placed her hands... channeled... jar glowed" sequences cleanly); rhythm varies for buildup to crescendo. Minor paraphrase loop in "complementary opposites" repeats (emptiness/fullness listed twice) dulls one beat (−0.4), but no closure touch or filter stacks; vivid images like "kaleidoscope" purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death, clone ethics, and yin-yang vivification in flux-universe dojo transforms tropes organically; risk in philosophical closure (exponential consciousness) heightens stakes via Maya's numbness crucible. Non-obvious angle on identity battle feels inevitable from jar label/setup to awakening pulse.</comment>
