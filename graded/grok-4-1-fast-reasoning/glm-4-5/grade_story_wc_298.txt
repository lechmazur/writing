<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reckless idealism roots her motivation and earns patience through ritual endurance, shown in contradictory impulses like bold approach versus gentle symbols during the memory's fight. Interiority concrete via card whispers and feather rustles; micro-choices reveal values. Minor label-speak ("fierce gentleness") slightly abstracts embodiment in climax without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to ritual absorption as DC with felt cost (her bartered life). Orientation anchored early ("catacomb orchard... tree roots... bones"). Tight single scene; closure image ("memory subsided and drifted... into its scorched surface") reconfigures balance legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard vividly specific, sensory-integrated (roots cradling bones, cold air, dust motes); constrains ritual via oldest tree/alcove and charges final sigh of roots/bones. POV-filtered through Elara's pattern-reading; evolves with memory's approach. Mirrors renewal theme without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trammel escaped sorrow) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory's fight and her symbols, narrowing to absorption with agency/cost (ongoing sacrifice). One tightening sufficient; climax tests commitment. Minor abstractness in stakes ("holes in the soul") but dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-sacrifice emerges organically from life/death orchard and card's absorption, reweighting bartered destinies in final vigil image without statement. Subtext in gentle trammeling invites ambiguity on costs. Resonance from particulars like scorched patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (inlaying meaning in roots/petals); voice poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax (short sentences during fight). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; propulsion weaves description into action. Minor overwrite in high-pressure climax ("traced symbols... feathers rustled... focused compassionately") with figurative stack dulls slightly (−0.4); no loops, scaffold clean. Closure image propels crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard, soul-patching ritual, and charred card transforms tropes; risk in dusky fantasy lyricism heightens stakes via inescapable vigil. Irreplaceable premise: removing orchard/ritual breaks logic/closure. Bold, non-obvious angle on mending.</comment>
