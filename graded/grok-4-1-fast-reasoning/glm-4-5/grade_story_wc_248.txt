<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory arsonist intuition enables destruction-reversal in portrait restoration, earning her redemptive stance with embodied guilt and resolve. Internal conflict layers via micro-choices like sketching replicas under trail pressure. Minor label-speak ("analytically intuitive") slightly abstracts pivotal pattern-seeing without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artistic trail densities pattern to complete tapestry's RR (Charged Poise in restored portrait revealing future self) with conceptual cost of embracing past. Orientation anchors early via fragment and archive; weeks-years summaries fit lens without causality break. One tightening via curator parallel narrows redemption path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dusty archive and artistic trail constrain choices, mirroring internal destruction/preservation via tactile handling. "Volcanic tenderness" motif charges final portrait image. Sensory selection (threads whispering, echoing halls) reflects analytical POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via trail discoveries forcing deepening self-curatorial parallel, culminating in restoration agency with felt emotional cost. Trade-off legible: hide vs. rebuild via destruction knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Destruction-renewal theme emerges organically from arson past, curator echo, and tapestry message, resonating in non-literal portrait future-self answer reweighting fire/art binary. Minor thematic echo in Maya's visitor quote ("both destruction and renewal") borders statement without replacing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: art-pattern focus biases noticing, modulating rhythmically ("trembling fingers traced"). Voice texture distinct via "volcanic tenderness" motif consistent under emotional peaks. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection without major loops, though minor paraphrase in repeated redemption summaries ("rescue forgotten promise") drags late momentum. Rhythmic variety supports accumulative build; purposeful "volcanic tenderness" repetition motif-taught. Closure image clear, propels via varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist's destruction expertise flips to preservation via self-curatorial art trail, transforming redemption trope through Aeridor weave logic. "Volcanic tenderness" inflects uniquely; risk in off-grid timejumps heightens underground resolve without gimmick.</comment>
