<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's calm inventiveness drives micro-choices like concealing the brush in the quill holder and painting covertly, revealing traits through action. Internal conflict subtle in balancing authority with secrecy, embodied in warm quill against ribs amid tension. Secondary characters (guard, Keeper) apply targeted pressure via whispers and confirmations. Minor slip: emotions mostly declarative, less contradictory layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pacing/walls to sundial completion/power surge, reweighting stakes toward poised ignition. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page—"embers of revolution began to glow"—with felt risk of detection as cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early (Elias in fort/blackout). No lens ambiguity or disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent walls and flickering blackout constrain secrecy/actions, narrowing perception to shadows/patterns. Half-painted sundial as micro-setting charges choices and final image, mirroring internal revolution. Sensory details (wan glow, warm metal) selective via Elias's priorities. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution via codes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through blackout-enabled painting and guard interruption, forcing tactical shifts. Agency in covert brushstrokes and confirmation to Keeper forecloses detection path with legible risk-cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure. Minor abstractness in stakes scale vs. on-page subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of subtle ideas igniting change emerges organically from sundial codes and "fire...catch naturally," reweighted in final embers image without moralizing. Subtext in shared winks and art-as-revolution carries ambiguity (success subtle, not forced). Protagonist arc inextricable from quiet spread motif. Resonant non-literal closure answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias toward angles/patterns; diction poetic yet controlled ("language of angles"). Dialogue subtext-heavy ("sundial awaits only the final stroke"), advances plot naturally. Rhythm modulates with tension, no head-hopping. Distinct texture in syntax reflects inventive mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, propulsion strong in painting sequence; high density integrates action/atmosphere. Minor artifacts: repetitive "winking hush"/"cradle of sparks" phrasing borders loop without obscuring closure (−0.4). No filter stacks or muddled metaphors in peaks. Clean mechanics overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-code revolution in luminous fort transforms trope via sundial mechanics and quill-brush ingenuity. Risky subtlety (no violence) heightens stakes organically. Memorable perspective on sentinel as artist-rebel. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
