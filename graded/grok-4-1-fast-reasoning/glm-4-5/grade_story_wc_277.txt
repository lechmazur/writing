<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in father's legacy compels consistent micro-choices like mapping contradictions; strength in observant trait enabling doubt of journalist. Weakness: internal conflict summarized via labels ("devotedly observant") rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal evidence beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to CR closure; legible cost in "orbits of regret had become orbits of justice" reconfigures stance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echoing dome and oak table constrain isolated work, amplify musings; dawn light charges final image. Sensory selection (echoes, star-dome) reflects POV priorities without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose truth) signaled early, deepens via contradiction logic with agency-driven tightening; felt cost in foreclosed regret path. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth-through-contradiction emerges organically from evidence work to legacy honor; final "showing people what they've refused to see" offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, ambiguity in real culprit lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with observant perceptual signature; whispers carry subtext. Capped per Q7 heavy debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("rosewood pen nib" 6x, "devotedly observant" 3x, "echoing observatory" 3x) creates synonym churn and paraphrase loops in reflective beats; template cadence in "Eleanor [action]" runs dulls propulsion through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalistic puzzle-solving in celestial isolation transforms mystery trope; risk in solemn-playful tone heightens emotional specificity.</comment>
