<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve knowledge is clear and intensifies via discovery, but traits like "rationally rebellious" and "abrasive calm" are over-articulated labels rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses during the cog-handling beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to placement; CR closure lands on-page in "Milo placed the... cog among his other treasures" with conceptual cost of endless quiet battle legible against Council above.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken ruins and "sedimentary layers" constrain choices (shifting waters demand concentration on return) and charge final image of "sewers and sunken ruins" vs. gleaming Poseidonis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. erasure signaled early and deepens accumulatively via cog discovery narrowing options to quiet defiance; cost felt in "battle... fought not with weapons but with preservation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. forgetfulness emerges organically from particulars like cog patina and placement; resonant CR in final sewers/skyscraper contrast reweights narratives without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of philosophical filtering (e.g., "mathematical beauty in its design"); minor repetition of key phrases slightly dulls rhythmic control under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "sedimentary layers" (4+ repeats) and "competing narratives" create redundancy dulling propulsion; density strong otherwise, but template cadence in relic descriptions triggers −0.8 accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh post-plague world with philosopher dredging brass truths transforms trope of rebel artifact hunter; cog's precision vs. "hubris" synthesis feels inevitable in quiet ending risk.</comment>
