<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through concrete sensations like "whalebone reverie" and handling own burden delicately, earning reframe of trapped existence; contradictory impulses in shaking off sediment-thoughts under pressure. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("gift rather than a curse") borders unearned but anchors in vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of burden calcifications builds to own and ancient, culminating in CR closure ("trapped... but also... connected") with conceptual cost legible in final image; orientation anchored early at edge of grotto; one tightening via delicate own-burden handling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze walls and starlight constrain choices ("orienting properly" for calcification), charging final departure image; sensory hierarchy vivid (metallic shimmer, lamp sputter, cool whalebone); lived-in navigation (descending chambers, natural altar).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through denser weights/visions to reweighting; agency in micro-choices (stillness for own burden) forecloses curse-path with felt cost in CR; no reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of burdens-weights emerges organically from calcifications to reframe trapped as connected, resonant in final image without moralizing; particulars like king's light burden shift meaning; invites ambiguity in "gift" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with fractal perceptual signature (hush as strata, time bending); rhythmic modulation in reverie ("fractal within fractal"); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., lamp flicker casts shadows while orienting); varied rhythm passes ear test; purposeful motif recurrence ("shingled hush," "orienting") without loops; minor overwriting in geological similes but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of burden-collection as geological/emotional fractal work transforms trapped trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via vision ("bronze towers under alien stars"); inevitable hindsight reweighting.</comment>
