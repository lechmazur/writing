<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Skeptic-to-believer arc consistent with traits, but "courageously kind decision" labels pivotal choice undramatized, flattening internal contradiction at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with gradual revelations tightening to CR closure; tile discovery and visions link causally without debt; final role-realization reconfigures options with conceptual cost legible in "keeper and participant."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tower and whale migration vividly sensory (resounding harmonies, pulsing warmth), constrain reflection and charge ending image; whale songs mirror internal symphony effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock/share tile) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via solitude visions to inviting others; cost felt in skepticism overcome, but lacks sharp trade-off narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Connection theme emerges organically from tile visions and sharing; final image of transcriptions surrounding tile offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (shifting symbols, resonant harmonies); no dialogue; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("through forgotten patterns," "entangled memories," "transcribing") create template cadence across multiple beats, dulling density; overwriting in descriptive runs obscures propulsion at revelations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic tile, whale-star links, and memory entanglement transforms tropes; tile's evolution feels inevitable, risking lyric premise payoff.</comment>
