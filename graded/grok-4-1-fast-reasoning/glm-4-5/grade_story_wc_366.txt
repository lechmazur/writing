<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's reticence contrasts with warmly observant eyes, driving discoveries; embodied loneliness resolves into earned kinship via letter-reading and stone-adding, with felt cost of transcending solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (glass, letters, stones) build density to RR closure; Elias's additions and light's restoration reconfigure isolation with conceptual cost legible in "his place in the chain was secure."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lantern room's salt-oil-pause smell and vibrating tower constrain maintenance and discoveries; recurring lantern beam charges final image, mirroring internal shift from fog to piercing light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of light maintenance deepens accumulatively via flicker-triggered finds into fellowship pressure; agency in recreating stack forecloses reticent solitude with emotional cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent kinship emerges via chain/stones/glass particulars, reweighted in final boat journey without moralizing; resonant answer in "stones stacked just right could tell stories deeper than words."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in "quiet intensity" noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from shadowed ascent to charged "burst back to life," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action; varied rhythm avoids loops, with "luminescent ache" motif purposeful; no artifacts dull closure's "shrinking tower" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted trope into generational stone/letter tradition; risk in anonymous chain transforms isolation into inevitable connection at horizon gaze.</comment>
