<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted in scavenging and method-building, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; interiority concrete yet summarizes epiphanies without embodied stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from anchor discovery to breakthrough confirmation as CR closure with felt isolation cost; orientation anchored early, but weeks-pass summary softens causality linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Benthic city vividly filters through Kael's viewport and ruins, with anchor chain constraining meditative choices and charging final image; sensory hierarchy matches professional curiosity without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of starlight navigation signaled early with skepticism tightening to breakthrough, but pressure remains intellectual without visceral on-page trade-offs or agency-testing reversals under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interconnectedness emerges organically from refracted light patterns and anchor motif shifting to cosmic link; final whisper offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in oceanic-cosmic biases; meditative rhythm modulates effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density strong, but minor paraphrase loops in "connections" phrasing and chain reiterations dull momentum without pattern payoff; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater star navigation post-aliens transforms isolation trope through edge geometry specifics; risk in "madness" premise heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
