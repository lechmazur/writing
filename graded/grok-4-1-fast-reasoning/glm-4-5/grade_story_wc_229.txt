<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove whispers over shouts roots consistently in traits and backstory, compelling the central choice with embodied longing; contradictory dreamer-vs-practical impulses act via Captain interaction. Interiority concrete in vial use and jasmine inhalation, avoiding stock epiphanies. Final endurance as "keeper of whispers" earned by return vibration, but lacks deeper flaws complicating the peak act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of intent/vibration imagery builds to Conceptual Repricing closure via cork's warmth and sister's felt connection, reweighting premise with emotional cost legible in "tears of screaming tenderness." Orientation anchored early (lighthouse, Elias, dawn); single scene with legible sister shard fits Track B. One tightening via vibration return narrows disbelief to certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jasmine's "potent and haunting" scent as micro-setting constrains beckoning act and charges final image via sister's inexplicable sense; cobalt lighthouse's "protective aura" mirrors internal transformation. Sensory hierarchy (scent over visual) reflects Elias's perceptual bias toward vibrations. Details selective, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers reach sister) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cork pulse to return vibration, forcing stance shift from hypothesis to certainty. Agency in whispering past cork/jasmine forecloses shouting path with felt emotional cost in heart's "intensity of a scream." Captain's curiosity tightens interpersonal pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pure whispers bridging distance emerges organically from vial ritual and cross-world connection, resonating in final cork-neck image without overt statement. Subtext in Captain's softened "sea listens best to those who speak softly" borders echo but layers via failed shouters. Complexity in intent's irreplaceability avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person Elias POV with clean sister shard switch; perceptual signature in vibration/scent bias distinct. Prose rhythm modulates poetic density to terse closure ("work done"). Sparse dialogue natural, subtexted (Captain's gruff-to-curious shift), advances via curiosity query.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("pure intent," "vibrations") and repetitive warmth imagery dull mid-section density, but rhythm varies with scene (lyrical build to crisp end). No major artifacts in peak cork pulse/return beat; sensory propulsion strong. Minor overwriting in "screaming tenderness" repeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vial cork's purifying magic synthesizes maritime folklore freshly into subtle realism, transforming lighthouse trope via vibration premise. Risky Accumulative close via distant connection feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; cork's irreplaceable logic commits fully.</comment>
