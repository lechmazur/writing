<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving persistent observation to revelation; embodied in trembling fingers and heart racing at discovery. Lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices—no internal conflict acts simultaneously, reducing depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure in final paragraphs, reweighting premise of pattern observation with conceptual cost of "enormity of his find." One tightening via pattern match; orientation anchored early (airship deck by para 2).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as recurring object constrains discovery, charging final replacement image; airship hums tactilely at close. Visuals selective (glow, flickering) reflect Eli's priorities; minor visual bias limits multisensory peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to realization without reversal testing commitment—no live option foreclosed beyond elusive connection yielding easily. Cost felt obliquely in "heart racing with the enormity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of patterns revealing hidden order emerges organically via board-symbols-luminance convergence; final kinship image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars (starlings aligning) reweight observation motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: pattern-focused noticing (rhythm of starlings, faded numbers). Rhythmic prose modulates to crescendo at "eyes widening"; no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("patterns" x4 in mid-section, "diligently curious"/persistent noting churn) dull density −0.6; rhythm varies but template stems ("Eli [action]") in observation beats. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher for light containment via bird dances transforms tropes ingeniously; synthesis of board, phrasebook, luminance feels inevitable. Fresh aerial cartography angle risks whimsy but coheres.</comment>
