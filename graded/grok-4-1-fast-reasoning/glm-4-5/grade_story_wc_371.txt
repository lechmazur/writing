<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eliza's sensitivity to "creeping normality" and guilt over past silence drive concrete micro-choices like establishing guerrilla gardens and reading the letter aloud, earning her absolution; interiority feels embodied in bread's shifting taste as forgiveness. Minor label-speak in "heuristically gentle" slightly abstracts a trait without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to CR closure in letter revelation and absolution shift ("something shifted within her"), with legible cost in guilt's tenuous release; orientation anchors firmly by para 2 in palace grounds and tea house. Single scene adheres to defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard, wisteria-curtained tea house, and guerrilla herbs constrain choices (harvesting for tea, hiding space) and charge final image of thriving garden and left bread; sensory details like rain on tin roof and bread's yeast scent mirror internal renewal purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering bakery truth escalates accumulatively via letters under floorboards to climax reading, forcing stance crystallization in absolution; one tightening suffices as revelation reweights prior guilt with felt emotional cost in bread's changed taste. No agency slips, but pressure leans reflective over urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges organically from particulars like bread, garden, and gradual decay, resonating in final image of persistent small actions reviving spaces without moralizing; subtext in family protection ties to Eliza's absolution, inviting ambiguity on speaking up. Earned through conflict, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in noticing incremental decay ("small changes others missed"); rhythmic prose modulates contemplative to charged in rain-drumming climax, voice distinct and biased toward lost things. Name flip (Eliza/Elima) minor but jars perceptual consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bread unwrapping evokes memory while advancing ritual); rhythm varies naturally, read-aloud propulsive. Minor paraphrase loops in "vanished bakery" repeats and name inconsistency (Eliza/Elima) ding opacity slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creeping normality" observer using guerrilla gardening and hidden letters to reframe disappearance as protection yields non-obvious absolution arc; guerrilla patches transform neglected space organically, risking quiet lyric closure that heightens stakes through persistence over drama.</comment>
