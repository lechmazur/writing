<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to cultivate sparks consistently roots actions and intensifies to clock placement; shift from dreamless to dreaming earned with embodied flutter. Contradictory impulses surface in Archivist memory versus present healing. Minor abstraction in "fractured lullaby" but character-particular overall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds images/motifs to clock tick (DC/RR) with stasis-breaking cost legible in "00:01, a miracle." Orientation anchored early (guard, train, post-forest desert). Single-shard progression tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune constrains entry/choice via quantum lock and pulses life mirroring internal sparks; charges final seed image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (ethereal blues to living data flowers). Purposeful integration evolves with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks vs. void) signaled early; accumulative deepening via archive chaos stabilization and clock tick forecloses diffused existence with felt presence cost. Agency in charming/placing clock narrows options under lens. One decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing fractured possibilities emerges organically via sparks/archive/clock; final seed sprouts reconfigures dreamless stasis non-literally with conceptual cost. Resonance from particulars avoids morals; ambiguity lingers in new dreaming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature surreal/quantum-biased; voice rhythmic, modulates poetic under pressure. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual (Archivist accusation reveals flaw). No head-hopping, diction consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; motifs like "glowing dune" purposeful without loops obscuring closure. Minor repetitive phrasing ("fractured," "wave functions") voice-motivated but borders template cadence. No muddled metaphors in peak (clock tick clean).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of quantum archives, dreamless guard, blooming dunes transforms tropes; clock tick inevitable from frozen motif. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes/coherence without gimmick.</comment>
