<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve cosmic knowledge compels sketching endurance with felt reverence in trembling hands; strength in pariah trait rooting temporal gift as consistent duality. Weakness: internal conflict summarized repetitively ("gift and curse") rather than acted simultaneously in pivotal sketch beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ritual sketches and perceptions builds to CR closure in final realization ("true north... within her all along") with conceptual cost of isolation burden legible in soul-weight image. One tightening via anniversary cue anchors orientation early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Deck's dormant hum and starlight constrain solitary sketching, mirroring isolation; compass rose as micro-setting charges final glinting beacon image, filtering through temporal bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation vs. purpose signaled early, deepens accumulatively through sketching ritual forcing endurance; cost unmistakable in "hands that trembled... with reverence," foreclosing despair path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of internal direction emerges via compass/sketch motifs but weakens with explicit articulation in penultimate line ("true north... within her all along"), functioning as thematic echo replacing resonant image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "temporally stretched moments"; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, though minor register elevation in reflections borders POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("gilded compass rose" x5 with synonym churn; "temporally stretched" templated across paras) and conceptual redundancy (isolation/purpose duality restated 7+ times) dull density, obscuring closure image; artifacts pervade final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal perception enabling shifted constellations in post-shutdown mapping transforms pariah trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmick.</comment>
