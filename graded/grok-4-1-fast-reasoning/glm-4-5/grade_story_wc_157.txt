<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to guard defiance clear and consistent, rooted in traits shown through navigation of surveillance; interiority concrete in final untaxed thought. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under pressure, relying on summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via layered resistance methods, holds to Charged Poise closure in final moonlight thought with conceptual cost of ongoing mechanization. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; vignette structure with one tightening via night-blooming cereus signal suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity and insect aversion constrain meetings; garden plots and mycelial vibrations charge final seed-shake image, filtering through Kaelen's priorities. Sensory details purposeful, mirroring defiance in organic chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resistance signaled early, escalates accumulatively via method convergence (linguistic to entomological) narrowing detection options; raid threats and adaptation costs legible, culminating in final phase signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reclamation of humanity emerges from organic methods clashing mechanized control; final untaxed freedom thought offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Kaelen-biased noticing of evasion tactics; cryptic dialogue like "storm approaches" carries subtext and advances stakes naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "converging chaos" (appears 3x) and method summaries dull density; rhythm varies but repetition in descriptions like plant patterns drags momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thought Tax premise and multi-sensory organic counter-surveillance (mycelial networks, insect lures) offer fresh synthesis; transforms dystopia via lived garden tactics charging defiance image.</comment>
