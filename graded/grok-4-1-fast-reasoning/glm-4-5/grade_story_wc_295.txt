<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode intensifies credibly from isolation to shared urgency, compelling collaboration at climax. Interiority concrete via dreams and visions, but emotions lean declarative over embodied contradiction. Dr. Thorne applies relevant pressure without depth; final change earned but lacks micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dreams/telegram to star glyphs/collaboration, yielding Charged Poise closure in final paragraphs where sharing reconfigures isolation. Orientation anchored early in observatory/dawn. One tightening via stars' legibility narrows solo path with relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory's telescopes/dome constrain discovery via lens adjustment, charging final image of sunlit completion. Sensory dawn light/creeping horizon mirrors internal shift purposefully. POV-filtered details (celestial charts, variable stars) integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode for healing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stars' transformation forcing shared burden. Agency in collaboration forecloses isolation with felt relational cost at "sharing this burden." Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared discovery emerges organically from celestial-human links, resonating in final image of collaborative wisdom without moralizing. Daylily telegram shifts meaning, reweighting isolation. Complexity lingers in future dreams' openness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward celestial patterns; voice poetic yet consistent, modulating to solace at end. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("You've found it"), advances plot. No head-hopping; diction fits dream chronicler.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("understanding dawning" thrice, "midnight solace" echoed) and repetitive satisfaction phrasing dull mid-section density. Rhythm varies with dawn progression, but elevated diction borders overwriting in visions. Propulsion clear, no closure artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stars-as-glyphs premise fresh, synthesizing dreams/telescopes/healing words organically. Transforms celestial trope via lucid chronicling; collaboration turn inevitable from prior hints. Risks quiet resonance payoff effectively.</comment>
