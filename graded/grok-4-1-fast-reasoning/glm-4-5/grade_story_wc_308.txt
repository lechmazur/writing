<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in reverence and quest, shown through trembling hands with arrowhead and final stone placement; embodied emotions like tears carving paths add specificity. Minor slip: internal conflict more declarative than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, e.g., "weathered resolve etched into his determined brow" feels stock without peak ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in arrowhead pulse and Kael's vanishing, cost legible in "Kael was gone" reweighting his quest. Orientation anchored early via skimmer before bone towers. One tightening via crows' arrow formation narrows path to depression without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like whispering echoes and shimmering air integrate into action, with canyon depression constraining climax choice. Bone towers and dust constrain movement, mirroring internal harmony; recurring dust particles evolve with footsteps, charging final circle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate without moving) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via birds' guidance and arrowhead resonance to stance crystallization with felt cost in disappearance. Agency in following cues and placing stones forecloses physical quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as dynamic journey emerges organically from particulars like stone ripples and bird patterns, resonant CR in final pulse reweighting premise without moralizing. Returning arrowhead shifts from wanderer to anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mystical noticing (e.g., "vibration that resonated deep within Kael's marrow"); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to poised closure. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but minor paraphrase loops in "ancient" repetitions (e.g., structures, civilization, stone skimmer) and dense figuratives like "ripples across an infinite pond" slightly muddle peak resonance reveal. Rhythm varies effectively overall; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-skimming craft and non-physical navigation transforms mystic quest trope via specific pulse-arrowhead logic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure image without gimmickry.</comment>
