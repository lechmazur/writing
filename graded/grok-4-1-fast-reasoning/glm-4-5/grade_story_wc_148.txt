<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to escape father's legacy through truth-telling, with internal conflict embodied in practicing voice and writing on walls; earned change in sustaining hope despite isolation. Lacks micro-choices under acute pressure, leaning toward summary reflection over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of recurring images building to CR closure: son's voice found, lattice as testament reconfiguring legacy with conceptual cost of sustained deception. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse cell, son of crier); single reflective scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (copperlight hues, salt/sorrow scent, worn lattice) filters through POV urgency, constraining reflection and charging final image; jagged reef mirrors trust's wreckage. Recurring door scuffs and lattice evolve with perception, guiding choices toward redemption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption before bodies found) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening impossibilities sustained to voice crystallization; agency in writing truth forecloses lie-path with felt legacy cost. Urgency coherent under lens, though external pressure (guards) remains observational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth separating from paternal lies emerges organically through lattice confidences and story-threading, resonant CR in final lattice testament reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in ambiguity of belief lingers via impossibilities sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased toward confessional lattice, salt-sorrow senses, poetic diction modulating reflective intensity. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic variation in read-aloud (short hovering phrases to sweeping beam), high density with purposeful motif repeats (copperlight repose); minor synonym churn in impossibilities but pattern serves accumulative lens without obscuring closure. No loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh fable inversion in lighthouse prison synthesis transforms tropes via lattice as redemption confessional; risk-taking in repetitive lyric structure heightens isolation stakes, inevitable in hindsight via threaded story arc.</comment>
