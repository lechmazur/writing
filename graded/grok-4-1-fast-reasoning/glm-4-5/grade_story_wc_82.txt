<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—grief as "luminous in torment, shining the brightest"—embody internal conflict, earning the final release as micro-choices in polishing and folding accumulate felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as polishing final gem deepens memory density toward RR closure; lantern's ascent with "tears of relief and sorrow" makes before/after legible with undeniable emotional cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass basilica's "transparent spires reaching for the heavens while somehow sinking into the mist" as architectural paradox mirrors internal ascent/descent, constraining journey and charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake to transform final dream tightens via memory flood during polishing; agency in crafting/journey forecloses grief's weight with tears as visible cost, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-hope emerges organically via crane/lantern images shifting from torment to beacon; final grounded presence after ascent reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "craftiness lay in his ability to find beauty even in pain"; rhythmic modulation heightens emotional beats without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence ("descends while ascending"); minor overwriting in gem descriptions but propulsion clear, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis of dream-gem polishing and grief-origami transforms loss trope organically; basilica placement feels inevitable, risking bold paradox imagery that heightens stakes.</comment>
