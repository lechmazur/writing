<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in sound translation compulsion, with micro-choices like infusing emotional resonance into the jar earning the final purposeful endurance; embodied wistfulness shows via trembling fingers and calloused hands. Minor diagnostic summary in "gleaned redemption" slightly abstracts peak motivation without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: awakening/discovery/capture accumulate to RR closure in the chorus image reconfiguring generational silence, with felt cost in poet's persistent vagrancy legible in final line. Orientation anchored early; one clear shard transition from loft to center maintains coherence. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dune loft's shifting sands and sound jars vividly constrain capture beat and charge final reprise; sensory hierarchy (light patterns, tinkle/warble) reflects poet's priorities, mirroring internal solitude to communal shift. Recurrent jars as micro-setting evolve with action, guiding choice without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (generational translation) signaled early, deepens via music box infusion narrowing to presentation risk; accumulative escalation peaks in room's halting-to-warm conversations forcing stance crystallization with visible relational cost. Agency clear in scavenging-to-sharing arc; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of small-act redemption emerges organically from jar captures to chorus, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer (hearts bridged sans words) reweighting prior solitude. Subtext in implied generational yearning avoids moralizing; particulars like tarnished dancers drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (beauty in discarded sounds/moments) stable in single POV; syntax/rhythm modulate from introspective dawn to charged observation, with purposeful compression in melody description enhancing texture. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits vagrant poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High figurative density borders overwriting in opening ("dust motes dancing in the theater"), with minor paraphrase loops ("positively wistful" reprise, "captured" variants) dulling some propulsion; rhythm varies but elevated diction drifts slightly in reflective blocks. Closure image clean, info-dense without artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of sound-jars and music box transforms vagrant trope into inevitable generational bridge; risk in abstract "sound capture" paid via tactile jar mechanics and emotional infusion heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; perspective memorable through poet's discarded-beauty lens.</comment>
