<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied through art actions like tracing the mask and powdering, revealing contradictory sorrow/determination; final realization earned via process. Micro-choices (assembling shards, removing her mask) show value hierarchy with cost in pursuing illusory safety. Minor diagnostic tone in epiphany ("mirage of safety... pursuit of it") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via art cycle (ash to masks), pattern break in chair's stop reconfigures stake. On-page CR closure ("no safety... continuous process of becoming") with conceptual cost legible in final image of placement/shadows. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery, mask, chair, powder constrain choices (e.g., powdering highlights cracks, chair cessation shakes reverie) and charge final image (shadows stretching). Sensory details (creak, dust settling, porcelain reflection) filtered via artist's bias. Evolving environment (emptying gallery, night fall) mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallizing emotion/safety via art) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to chair-stop realization narrowing options to endurance. Agency in persistent creation forecloses completion illusion with felt conceptual cost. One tightening (reverie break) driven by environmental pressure suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (safety mirage, temporariness) emerges organically from ash/mask cycle and chair image, reweighted non-literally in CR ending. Subtext in fragments inviting projection avoids moralizing. Repeated "mirage" phrasing borders echo, slightly overt in final para.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (fragmented truths, art observations) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates to charged poise at end. Compression purposeful, taught early via disintegrating portraits. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("mirage of safety" x3, "weaving truth carefully" x2, "incomplete information" x2) and synonym churn dull momentum, especially final third. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors; propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unique premise (ash scatterer, porcelain masks) synthesizes destruction/rebirth freshly; rocking chair reprise transforms motif organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
