<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in diagnosis intensifies believably through physical toll, compelling higher-stakes endurance; interiority concrete in arthritis and dreams. Strengths in embodied calm and micro-choices under failing body; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build across months to Charged Poise closure: orchard awakens as Elias dies, cost legible in "weakening heart" syncing with pillars' glow. Orientation anchored early; time jumps as motivated ellipsis tighten to final circuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "metal singing against the wood" and "whispers on the wind" filter through Elias's priorities, constraining wire work via arthritis. Living pillars charge final image, evolving causally with remodel; 9+ as setting shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete remodel for interspecies bridge) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via body decline and orchard responses, narrowing options to final push. Protagonist agency in persistent work forecloses health with on-page physical cost; one decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies harmony emerges organically from remodel events and transformations, resonating in final symphony without moralizing. Final image reconfigures endings as "connections to new beginnings," charging prior motifs; ambiguity lingers in posthumous tending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in orchard rhythms and wire patterns; rhythmic prose modulates from calm method to glowing peace. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits accumulative lens, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action and image without loops dulling propulsion. Intentional repetitions like "architectural secrets" emphasize motif without obscuring closure; minor exact phrase reuse ("copper wire wrapped around oak branches") borders artifact but serves pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant intelligence via constellation-wired pillars transforms tropes organically; bold premise follows implications to CR closure. Risk in quiet death-as-bridge feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry; specific details anchor universality.</comment>
