<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in curiosity and loss drives micro-choices like nightly sketching and final touching; embodied emotions in trembling hands and resurfacing memories feel particular. Minor slip in label-like "chronically curious nature" lacks embodied friction, but restoration earns closure without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star-mushroom alignments build density to shimmering ground and visions, culminating in RR closure via memory return with decades-long cost legible in "preserved within this liminal space." Orientation anchors early; single tightening at seventh shape suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and vines constrain her persistent returns and charge final sighing frames; sensory details like dew-covered caps filter through folklorist bias. Recurring fairy ring and broken ceiling evolve causally, mirroring internal realignment without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early, tightens via alignment visions narrowing to touching decision; agency in precise comparisons forecloses fragmented state with felt time-cost. Accumulative escalation coheres without reversal overload; cost unmistakable in restored self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of folklore as tangible preservation emerges organically from alignments and reclamation, resonating in final image of dimmed ring awaiting next soul. Borders echo in "folklore wasn't just story but memory made tangible," slightly overt without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with folklorist perceptual signature in pattern-tracing; prose texture modulates from marveling to clarity in visions. No head-hopping or elision; rhythmic control heightens pressure in pulsing light beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "broken keys in the sky matching the contours of the mushroom circle"; varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor "broken" recurrence taught early as pattern, no loops or artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-thief folklore with star-mushroom causality and shipwreck liminality transforms tropes; non-obvious key-constellation turn inevitable from particulars. Risk in accumulative celestial-earth linkage heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
