<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orion's meek-to-authoritative arc feels earned through hesitation and deliberate barter, with embodied surge of energy showing internal shift; minor slip in epiphanic summary ("true resilience wasn't about...") borders on unearned insight without deeper contradiction in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via repair pattern density building to CR closure in legend image with traded uncertainty as felt cost; one tightening at elders' arch challenge narrows stakes coherently; orientation anchored early in Veridia orchards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mine shafts and floating arches constrain choices (materials, repairs) and charge final image of "azure defiance against the orange sunset"; sensory details like humming silk and dripping water filter through Orion's possibility-seeing bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repurpose rubble for resilience) signaled early, tightens via elders' task forcing higher application; agency in deliberate barter and forging forecloses meekness with essence cost legible in surge; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of strength from repair emerges organically via repeated azure flares and final CR repricing brokenness; resonant non-literal close in legend avoids moralizing; recurring shards motif shifts meaning without token symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of "possibility where others saw only scrap"; rhythmic prose modulates from introspective hesitation to purposeful forging; no dialogue, but diction/perception biases consistently blacksmith-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("quiet demeanor" echoed in "quiet defiance/authority") and azure motif repetition border on scaffold without full pattern payoff; rhythm propels accumulatively, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of overlooked blacksmith bartering silk for rubble resilience on unique orchard-arch planet; transforms trope via specific mine-shaft forging and CR on repair philosophy; risk in poetic accumulative drive heightens without gimmick.</comment>
