<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marlo's skillset (walks, acoustics, maps) roots motivation and drives micro-choices like positioning and whispering; embodied confidence shows in smile and coin-warming without stock epiphanies. Competent traits dominate without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal whisper beat, limiting to strong but not exceptional. Vance as secondary applies suspicion pressure, altering stance subtly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: planning/maps/whispers lead to pre-arrival directions succeeding before Vance's shouts fail. Single scene oriented early (Marlo in labyrinth/storm by para 2). Closure as Charged Poise—success with Vance's suspicion cost—lands on-page in "stared suspiciously" and new map addition, foreclosing direct confrontation path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers' acoustics constrain whisper tactic and charge final map image; storm blackouts enable shadows, hum guides walk-detection. Sensory hierarchy (hums, splashes, wind) filters through Marlo's expertise bias. Spatial choreography coherent, evolving with storm peak/subsidence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers superior) signaled early, tightens via timed whisper reaching post first (agency forecloses shout-reliance). Vance arrival tests with suspicion cost, but lacks deeper trade-off in climax interaction. Causal escalation narrows to poised victory under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of subtle mastery (whispers/walks/maps) over brute force emerges via acoustics triumph and coin/map reprise reweighting premise. Final image (new map, cool coin) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor ambiguity in zodiac warmth lacks counter-reading depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature (walk rhythms, metal hums); diction/rhythm modulates from meticulous setup to tense detection. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You seem to know..."), advances via suspicion. No head-hopping; perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., map creases=zodiac amusingly shown); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor loops in "geomagnetic storm"/"folded maps" repeats across non-adjacent beats dull texture slightly (-0.4 routed here), not touching closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Acoustics highways in container maze during storm synthesizes fresh ingenuity, transforming port tropes via walk-ID/whisper physics. Risky "calculated spontaneity" payoff feels inevitable from map/coin buildup. Transformation test passes: swaps break logic/closure.</comment>
