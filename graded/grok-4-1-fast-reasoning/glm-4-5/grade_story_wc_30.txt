<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to preserve wonder roots in accepting contradictions, shown concretely in "no longer fighting the changes that came with lunar cycles." Internal conflict emerges in embodied flux during tide but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a pivotal micro-choice. Earned synthesis feels credible but borders on unearned epiphany without rawer struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from collection to smelting to tide emergence as CR/RR closure with conceptual cost of perpetual flux legible in "something entirely new—a synthesis." Orientation anchored early in atrium and moon phase. Single scene tightening via tide suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium vividly constrains (armor for tide, submersion alters texts) and charges final image of receding water revealing filled creel. Sensory selection (ripples, hiss, cold fire) POV-filtered through librarian's watery priorities. Environment mirrors internal tides purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving flux-tightened collection signaled early; deepening in tide's "identity migration" narrows to synthesis under Accumulative lens with acceptance cost felt in standing motionless. Agency via ritual choices coherent; one cadence shift suffices. Stakes viscerally tied to submersion/reemergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation via contradiction emerges organically from tidal alterations and identity synthesis, resonating in final whisper reweighting "who we might become tomorrow." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in flux harmony. Particulars like ruined/reappearing texts drive earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct tidal perceptual signature ("water to ripple, sending reflections dancing"). Rhythmic prose modulates serenely under ritual pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise. No POV slips; voice texture suits lyrical aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause/effect. Metaphors consistent (tides/silver/waves) without muddle in peak tide beat. Minor overwriting in reflections doesn't dull closure image of emerging librarian.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library and migrating identities transforms preservation trope via "after tomorrow disappears" frame and cold-fire forge. Risky lyric flux heightens stakes in synthesis without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight from early pattern.</comment>
