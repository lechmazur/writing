<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority particularized through embodied penumbra and pawn touch revealing ruthless benevolence tradeoff; contradictory impulses act in selective preservation realization with visible cost; minor abstraction in mission summaries slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via walking incantations to pawn CR closure; cost legible in "couldn't save everyone's memories, only select examples"; orientation anchored early, pattern taught and holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery echoes constrain walking spells and amplify steps; chessboard/pawn recur to charge final image; penumbra as micro-setting filters perception purposefully without static lists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory preservation tightens accumulatively via pattern completion and pawn emergence; agency in steps forces ruthless selection with on-page cost; coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures vs. erasure emerges organically via pawn speaking for missing masses; final image reconfigures luminous absence without moralizing; earned resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in step-deciphering and penumbra intimacy; rhythmic modulation builds lyric density; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythms, but repetitive penumbra/mission phrasing creates paraphrase loops dulling mid-section propulsion; motifs purposeful yet over-recur without variation touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Walking spells and penumbra synthesize fresh memory-unbinding frame; transforms crisis tropes through grounded historian angle; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
