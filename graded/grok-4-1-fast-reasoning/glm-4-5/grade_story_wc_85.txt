<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in guilt over erasing grandfather's identity versus manufacturing lies for others, embodied in trembling fingers and bile; final renunciation of business earned by carving discovery with tears as cost. Contradictory impulses act on-page during sifting. Minor reflective summary in mother's face memory doesn't flatten peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of carvings and reflections builds to Conceptual Repricing closure via unrecognized carving's initials reweighting erasure premise, with undeniable emotional cost in burning watch hand and tears. Orientation anchored early (cobalt terrace, dusk, genealogist). Single scene with seamless terrace-to-shore transition; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings as micro-setting constrain sifting choice and charge final image of reconciled pair in sand; sensory hush of waves/twilight mirrors internal sieved conscience, selective via POV bias. Cold terrace and moonlight evolve causally with descent and recognition. No white-room; lived-in tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (withheld truth discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via unrecognized carving deepening knowledge and forcing epiphany; agency in persistent sifting forecloses deception path with tears/decision cost legible on-page. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in placing items as tide rises. Minor abstractness in initial stakes but escalates via concrete find.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of real acknowledgment over manufactured legacies emerges organically from carvings/watch hand particulars, reweighted in final image sans moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable as erasure confronts unconditional love. Resonant non-literal answer in reconciled objects/tide. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "tempered regret" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in guilt-filtered noticing (deliberate sanding patterns); rhythmic modulation builds to compressed realization at carving lift. Prose texture poetic yet grounded, consistent under stress. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sieved hush" motif taught early, propels atmosphere/causality); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops in peak discovery beat. Minor overwriting in reflective blocks (e.g., "burdened by truth") but purposeful, not obscuring closure image. Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of black market genealogy via driftwood carvings transforms regret trope into tactile puzzle; risk in lyric accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. Carving initials as inevitable turn from particulars. No derivative templates; memorable voice/setting angle.</comment>
