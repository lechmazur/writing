<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation roots in defiant drumming and shared dream, compelling the summoning choice with embodied sorrow at the lagoon's edge; internal conflict emerges in rebellion vs. containment. Minor diagnostic labels like "neural entanglement" slightly abstract peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drumming patterns build from cell taps to garden transformation; closure RR (Charged Poise) lands in Theo's manifestation and "fragile hope," with legible cost in monitoring flicker-back. Orientation anchors early in cell/garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains climax drumming and charges final lagoon image; vibrations as "ripples in the air" and "liquid light" filter through Elena's sensory rebellion. Tactile metal/resonance integrates purposefully without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (summon Theo via dream) tightens accumulatively through offline window to garden coalescence; agency in drumming forecloses isolation with temporary cost as systems revive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of entanglement defying separation emerges from drumming-to-lagoon arc; final "sanctuary built... of defiance and love" reweights premise non-literally with auroral sorrow's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rhythmic syntax mirrors drumming perceptual bias; stable single POV focalizes vibrations/memories cleanly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative stack ("flowers of light, trees of resonant color") borders overwrites in opening without early pattern-teach; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum entanglement and sonic garden yields inevitable drumming-lagoon payoff; risky lyric sci-fi transforms tropes through rhythm rebellion.</comment>
