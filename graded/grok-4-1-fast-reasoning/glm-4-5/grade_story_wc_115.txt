<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus's skepticism and recklessness are consistent but surface-level, with interiority relying on stock phrases like "heart pounding against his ribs"; final change to lightness feels summarized rather than earned through contradictory impulses in pivotal vision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from valve/radio to CR closure; radio confession tightens knowledge with legible cost in "weight... settled... like lead" to final lightness; orientation anchored early in tunnel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel as micro-setting pulses warmly, constrains surrender choice, and charges final cooling image; sensory details like "breath formed small clouds" selective and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens via radio call/vison under accumulative lens, narrowing to realization; cost felt in chest weight shifting tactics to confession understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths emerges organically via valve/radio/ghost shift, resonant in final "secrets released into the morning air" without overt moralizing; earned through particulars, invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (skeptical yet sensing pulses); rhythmic prose modulates tension, radio snippets natural/subtextual; diction atmospheric without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "swallowed truth"/"weight" repetitions across ending, dulling closure image slightly; strong propulsion overall, vivid specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban exploration, radio psychics, and ghost shift as human confession; valve wheel reprise transforms trope organically without template echoes.</comment>
