<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore practices intensifies credibly from vine visions, compelling higher-stakes work; interiority concrete in tracing vine but slips to stock "heart ached" phrasing. Contradictory impulses minimal, actions align with whimsical traits shown via device-building. Final endurance of her purpose earns change without deep cost in pivotal activation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of visions, fragments, songs builds to RR closure where community remembers amid dancing lights, vine reverts with felt effort cost. Orientation anchored early in arbor; one tightening via device incorporation suffices. Summary jumps ("for days") cohere without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (pulsing luminescence, amber moon) filtered through Elara's priorities, subtly guiding choices (arbor as fortress). Recurring vine and arbor constrain invention and charge final image of natural return. Moon amplifies climax without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore before moon) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment-gathering to device success narrowing fading-memory options. Agency in feverish work and activation forces communal crystallization; cost legible in effort, visible in vine's spin at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of restoration via memory emerges organically from vine visions and songs, subtext in swaying elders mirroring internal healing. Final arbor dawn image reconfigures cycles with resonant ambiguity of enduring magic, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature in "golden stories" diction; rhythm modulates from hushed dawn to resonant notes. No dialogue to judge; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure cadence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action/image; minor paraphrase loops ("spun golden stories," arbor repeats) and figurative density in climax slightly dull propulsion. No artifacts obscure vine spin closure; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-vine device restoring songs transforms folklore tropes via specific arbor logic and memory calculus. Risky magical realism commits fully; vine's evolution feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
