<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through notebook sketches and murmurs; realization of time as landscape earned via rope micro-choices with felt conceptual cost. Minimal simultaneous contradiction limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density increases revelations; CR closure lands on-page in "Time... landscape" realization with undeniable conceptual cost of new temporal territories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls and starlight constrain intimate rope pattern and charge final coiling image; selective sensory warmth mirrors internal blurring without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of temporal discovery signaled early, deepens via pattern's rippling changes under Textural lens; cost legible in impossible choices converging at knot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of liquid time emerges organically from rope mandala shifts; final image reconfigures premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity of coexistence costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward starlit contours and knots; rhythmic modulation heightens during deliberate adjustments, stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "pattern" (complex, intricate, mandala) dull two mid-beats; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prison rope as time-map post-energy beings transforms poet trope; risk of lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
