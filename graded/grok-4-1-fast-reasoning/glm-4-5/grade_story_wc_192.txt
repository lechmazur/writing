<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between craving solitude and duty's pull, embodied in aching scars and clutched ring; final extension of scarred hand earns change with cost of leaving isolation. Minor slip in reflective summary of bridge-burning feels slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ash patterns and pulsing ring build density to RR closure (stepping through door, linking scars); cost legible in "leaving behind the ashen comfort... only loneliness." Orientation anchored early (97 days, sanctuary under starlight); no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring ring and threshold constrain choices (knock to manifest door) and charge final image ("doorknocker ring, now warm... thresholds crossed"); selective sensory details (mist breath, throbbing warmth) filter through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. duty) tightens accumulatively via ring's pulse and resonating scars, narrowing to agency in knocking/stepping through; cost felt in abandoned sanctuary, charging poise toward dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared scars transcending isolation emerges organically from ash patterns to hand extension; final image ("linking through scars... possibility only connection can bring") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased toward shadows/scars; late dialogue natural/subtextual ("I won't promise it won't hurt"), advances closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (e.g., three knocks building cadence); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (ashen floor to starlight door). Minor repetition of "carefully" voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh allegorical synthesis of shadow-keeping and scar-linking transforms isolation trope; risk in poetic compression inevitable in hindsight, heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
