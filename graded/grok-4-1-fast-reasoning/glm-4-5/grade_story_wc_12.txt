<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Priest's motivation clear and intensifies via unorthodox methods, with micro-choices like adding loops earning the exorcism's success; embodied reactions in Sarah reveal entity under pressure. Limited interior contradiction, but actions align consistently without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic layers build density to paradox trap ("Can that which is eternal be contained..."), culminating in on-page closure via silence dissolving entity with felt cost to its integration. Orientation anchored immediately in church/anchor; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silence as physical weight and indigo symbols constrain tactics, charging final flare/fade; sensory hierarchy sharpens on sound/sight amid crisis. Recurring anchor and palette integrate via action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise before completion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via loops/symbols narrowing entity's hold, with agency in priest's architecture forcing falter at rhetorical paradox. Cost legible in Sarah's writhing/weakening, charging silence's payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence birthing truth emerges organically from sonic buildup to "profound silence" hanging power, reweighting indigo's void/purity without moralizing; resonant final reflection on "space created by silence" answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable priest-POV with perceptual signature in sonic/rhetorical focus; voice modulates rhythmically with loops, chant dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("Who are you..."). Clean free indirect, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., loops as both action/barrier); rhythm varies for buildup, minor paraphrase in "unraveled stillness" repetitions purposeful for motif without obscuring closure. No heavy artifacts, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal/rhetoric/indigo transforms exorcism trope organically, with paradox turn ("eternal...temporary") inevitable from sonic architecture; bold risk in heretical methods heightens stakes ingeniously.</comment>
