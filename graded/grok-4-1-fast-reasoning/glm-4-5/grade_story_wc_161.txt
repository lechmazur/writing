<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in loss of pigeons, with contradictory impulses (erase vs. reclaim past) acting in scene via meteorite mapping and letter-signing; earned change at signature shift feels compelled by prior causality, though some reflective summaries slightly dilute embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from meteorite discovery to dust-pattern trust, culminating in Charged Poise RR at pigeon release under skylight; on-page cost legible in "honor[ing] the withering of what had come before," reconfiguring past/future balance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting (skylight, dust motes) constrains choices like mapping swirls for decisions and charges final image of swirling celebration; sensory details (aging paper smell, warm chip) filtered through POV urgency, vivid and purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore pigeon service to preserve songs) signaled early and deepens via meteorite/dust patterns narrowing to letter/release; agency in micro-choices forecloses erasure path with felt risk/cost at "piece of space keeping earth-bound connections possible."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balanced reinvention emerges organically from recurring images (dust trails, meteorite hum echoing songs), reweighted non-literally in final release image without moralizing; complexity lingers in loss honored amid renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical perceptual signature (tracing "invisible paths," heartbeat-synced swirls) modulates with intensity; stable single POV with rhythmic diction suits accumulative texture, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative overwriting (e.g., "cosmic dust of yesterdays," repeated "paper trails") crowds some beats without pattern payoff; minor loops in dust/mote phrasing deduct slightly, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorite-guided dust divination reviving pigeons transforms reinvention trope organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens cosmic-personal stakes, inevitable in hindsight at charm-affixed release.</comment>
