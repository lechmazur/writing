<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via embodied actions like tracing sprocket holes and tear; motivation intensifies credibly to projection decision with bittersweet cost. Minor slip in unearned self-epiphany ("her own heart had been a repository too") abstracts without prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure ("located where unused love was stored—in the liminal spaces"); cost legible in "bittersweet sacrifice" and purpose reconfiguration. Orientation anchored immediately; no shards or transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Projection booth as micro-setting constrains choices (threading film) and charges final image ("dusty beam of light carried forgotten lyrics"); sensory details (vibrations, hum, red light) filter through POV urgency. Evolving spatial expansion mirrors internal state purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate stored love) signaled early, escalates via deepening psychometry ("sees projectionists," discovers fused letters) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to release with tear as felt cost. Agency in incubation and threading forecloses withholding path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved emotion in liminal spaces emerges organically from film handling and realization; final CR image ("project not merely images but...essence") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of sacrifice. No moralizing; ambiguity in beauty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (spatial imagination, liminal focus); rhythmic lyric texture modulates intensity. Patterned phrases ("spaces between") taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density, but patterned repetition ("forgotten lyrics searched for their tune" x5, "spaces between" echoes) creates template cadence across beats, dulling momentum; minor paraphrase loops in realization sequence ("psychometry reading deepened...discovered"). Figurative coherence holds, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, celluloid as emotional archive, and spatial imagination transforms film trope into quantum archive of feeling; risk in lyric density pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
