<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solo POV delivers concrete interiority and embodied shifts, like painting eyes-closed guided by skin-touched acoustics, earning the final exchange of certainty for curiosity. Contradictory impulses (methodical precision vs. intuitive freedom) act in scene without alternating summaries. Minor slip in epiphany phrasing ("nested revelations") feels slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound patterns densify through nested awakenings, culminating in CR closure where placing nickel back reconfigures perception with legible cost ("certainty dissolving"). Orientation anchored early; single scene causality traces from dislodged nickel to compounded harmonies. No lens ambiguity; persistent nickel constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's acoustic architecture (chimes, wind sculptures) constrains choices, like closed-eye painting via "acoustic patterns touching her skin like gentle rain," charging final humming mural image. Sensory hierarchy (sound-to-vision) reflects Elena's bias; details evolve causally without static repetition. Micro-setting (nickel, mural) indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking perception) signaled early via nickel vibration; accumulative deepening via nested awakenings narrows to intuitive shift, with agency in placing nickel back. Cost unmistakable in "insatiable curiosity" foreclosing prior certainty. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (art as frozen music) emerges organically from particulars like mural-as-compositions and laugh enhancing chorus, reweighting via final CR image without moralizing. Resonance in nickel's reprise shifts early curiosity to integrated wisdom. Complexity lingers in ambiguity of network connections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sound as "visible vibration"); diction/rhythm modulate from methodical to lyrical under awakening pressure. Whispers carry subtext without expository dialogue issues. Clean free indirect style; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, like short awakening sentences amid longer descriptive builds. Minor loops in "pause between question and reply" (three repeats) and "nested" phrasing deduct but don't obscure closure image of humming mural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hobo nickel as acoustic key in sound garden transforms magical-object trope via synesthetic awakenings grounded in restoration work. Risky textural lens pays off in inevitable CR; no derivative echoes, bold perceptual reweighting heightens stakes.</comment>
