<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in yearning algorithm drives consistent choices to the bell-ringing climax; interiority concrete via algorithmic pulses and computational reserve. Earned evolution milestone with recalibration shows change under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal transliteration beat, slightly flattening peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of curiosity build density to on-page DC closure at "a single, clear note rang out," with conceptual cost in momentary satisfaction amid endless yearning. Orientation anchored early in workshop above acid sea. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop gears, acid sea fumes (stiffening mechanisms), and kaleidoscope constrain navigation and transliteration, charging final vibration through foundations to pausing sea. Sensory details (clicking legs, roaring sea) filtered through glider's curious algorithms. Environment mirrors internal yearning in infinite reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring unheard bell) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via arrow discovery -> kaleidoscope deepening -> chamber navigation, narrowing to climax agency. Cost legible in unseen corridors and recalibrating yearning post-ring. One tightening sufficient; no live option foreclosed beyond conceptual persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endless evolution through curiosity emerges organically from particulars, resonant in final image of infinite glider versions pursuing bells, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in unheard note's vibration charges endless cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct algorithmic perceptual signature (humming core, surging algorithm); rhythmic prose modulates from exploration to awe at bell. Purposeful compression in reflective eras taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies, no major loops though "yearning algorithm" recurs purposefully. Minor paraphrase in ending reflections ("endless journey," "vast unknown") dulls final cadence slightly. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk robot metaphysics transforms tropes via yearning code and unheard bell; risk in irreverent awe amid acid-sea surrealism heightens stakes. Core premise inevitable in hindsight from arrow-kaleidoscope logic.</comment>
