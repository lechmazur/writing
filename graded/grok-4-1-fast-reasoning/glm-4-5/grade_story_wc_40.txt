<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of wonder and extinction pain act in scene via crystal interactions; final shift from preservation to translation earned by consistent reverence-motivated micro-choices. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in trembling hands and whispers. No unearned epiphanies; weathered innocence flaws complicate duty without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of insights builds to CR closure in crystal's pure tone and realization line ("bridging what was with what would be"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of transformation over stasis. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via vibration to resonant tone narrows interpretive options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring crystal as micro-setting constrains decoding choices and charges final dawn-facet image. Sensory details (dust motes, old paper scent, sonic vibrations) selective via POV priorities, integrated into actions like tracing spines. Atmosphere of hush-potential mirrors internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode linguistic growth amid extinction) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through crystal echoes to revelation that forces stance shift with felt cost of reframed duty. Agency in whispers and listening forecloses pure preservation path. No live options fully narrowed until peak tone beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformative language emerges organically from fractal roots murmur and crystal finale, offering non-literal answer via facets image that reweights prior extinctions with ambiguity of evolution. Subtext in reverent silence avoids platitudes; irony of world's rush vs. library stasis lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: reverence biases notice to sonic echoes and etymologies. Lyrical rhythm modulates from hushed reflection to charged revelation without filter excess. Voice texture coherent, syntax reflecting scholar's precise mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; read-aloud ear strong in dawn progression. Motif repetitions ("fractured sequences," "weathered innocence") patterned but border paraphrase loops in reflective blocks, slightly dulling mid-section momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic crystal premise synthesizes linguistics and revelation freshly; reticence-as-reverence transforms scholar trope organically. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight via crystal's tonal climax.</comment>
