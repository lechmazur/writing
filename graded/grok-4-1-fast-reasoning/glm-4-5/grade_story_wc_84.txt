<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to decode belonging drives micro-choices like drone guidance, with embodied tension in "racing heart"; competent struggle balanced by initial missing connection. Perpetually surprised trait over-labels without deepening contradiction in pivotal alert jump, limiting interior complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as data patterns densify to drone convergence and CR closure: Maya's realization as "the missing piece" reconfigures premise with felt alignment cost in final pulse waves. One tightening via interference alert narrows to pull sequence; orientation anchored early at parapet/dusk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory dome and dusk constrain drone paths and star trails, charging convergence; "copper dome" and "liquid night" filter through Maya's data urgency. Recurring "brilliant dimness" mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early tightens accumulatively via alert interference forcing precise maneuvers to convergence; agency in pull activation forecloses disconnection path. Cost legible in "racing heart" and millennia-open circuit, though opposition mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as recognition emerges organically from chip/drone patterns to CR realization she's the piece, reweighting seeker role without statement. Final image pulses resonance through "pure recognition," inviting ambiguity on universal fit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward data streams and star trails; voice texture poetic yet data-precise, modulating to wonder at "genuine wonder" smile. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in holographic data legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "perpetually surprised" (x3) and "brilliant dimness" (x3) create minor paraphrase loops in descriptive beats, dulling density without full pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but elevated diction like "harmonic frequencies" clashes slightly in peak pull; propulsion solid overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech, ancient observatory, and type foundry chip transforms cosmic quest tropes into data-resonance premise. Risky "brilliant dimness" tone and CR self-as-piece turn feel inevitable from patterns, heightening ingenuity.</comment>
