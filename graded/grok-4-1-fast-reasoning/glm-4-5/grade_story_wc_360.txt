<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to quantify emotion drives choices consistently, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses during the transfer; Thomas remains a reactive data point without status dynamics pressuring her. Ethics noted abstractly without complicating peak micro-choices. Final endurance earned but lacks visible internal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of star vanishings and data points builds to CR closure repricing emotion as equation, with oblique ethical cost legible in final image of notebooks and press. Single scene oriented early; one tightening via Thomas's arrival narrows to experiment payoff. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Halo fragment and topaz walls constrain experiment and charge final protective casing image; sensory details (shimmering light, clanking press) selective via Elara's priorities, mirroring emotional patterns without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent amid shifting shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through disorienting transfer forcing Thomas's panic and her data harvest; cost legible in his staggering exit and her ethical dismissal. Agency in inviting/activating empathy forecloses relational norm with felt disorientation price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quantifiable emotion emerges organically from halo-enabled transfers and star counts, resonating in CR final image without moralizing; ambiguity in ethics invites reflection via Elara's unhedged flaws. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Elara's perceptual bias (geometric patterns, emotional matrices); voice rhythmic and selective, modulating from precise calculations to intoned mystery. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in her ambiguous replies advancing experiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in star vanishings and "another" repetitions dull propulsion slightly; no artifacts in closure. Sensory propulsion strong, overwriting absent in peak transfer beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mysticism, empathy math, and celestial vanishings transforms tropes into inevitable CR; halo's refraction and personality borrowing risk bold premise payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
