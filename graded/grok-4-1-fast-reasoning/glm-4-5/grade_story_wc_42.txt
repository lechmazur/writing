<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied ache and micro-choices under pressure, like placing the clock outside, earn her transcendence; minor slip in unearned epiphany phrasing at "ache of recognition deep within her" borders diagnostic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with clock's spin building to RR closure in slowing hand and new images; cost legible in "beauty too profound to fully comprehend"; orientation anchored early in observatory setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting of observation deck and viewport constrains choices and charges final image; shaking foundations evolve causally, mirroring internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing ephemeral tightens via leaf-whisper realization narrowing to filter restructure; agency-driven escalation reweights perception with on-page cost of profound ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over force emerges organically from clock trials to final luminous pattern; resonant non-literal answer in closing image reweights limits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature blending mechanics and metaphysics; voice modulates poetically under stress, dialogue sparse but goal-driven in astronomer's announcement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel beats, but repeated "luminous ache" and "ephemeral" create minor overwrite loops in peak realization without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic clock as metaphysical map in sci-fi observatory transforms malfunction trope; risk in resonance premise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
