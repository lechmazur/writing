<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and internal conflict in tunnel scene, with methodical traits constraining intuitive risks; minor diagnostic label-speak ("daringly methodical nature") slightly undercuts immediacy but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of revelations (graffiti to tunnel) tightening to CR closure; final harmony image reconfigures denial/medication diversion with emotional cost legible in tears joining river.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-clawed brickwork and mossy stone constrain exploration and charge final image; sensory details (water sound, dust motes) filtered through river-chronicler bias integrate seamlessly without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant self-forgiveness stake signaled early, escalates via graffiti discoveries narrowing path under Accum lens; closure cost felt in embracing unchartable currents, though no explicit trade-off beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>River-diversion motif emerges organically to reweight premise in final image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like taped bellows avoids platitudes, though repeated "self-forgiveness" borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (rivers as soul metaphor); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, but minor register elevation in reflections ("charted the terrain of her own soul") fits lyric mode without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with river motifs purposeful, but paraphrase loops ("daringly methodical" thrice, river curves/meandering) and heavy figuration in reflective beats create minor drag; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-map quest and brother's accordion charges healing arc; bathroom wisdom as intimate counter to official records transforms tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
