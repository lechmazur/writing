<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation uniquely rooted in father's description of "a silence that screams," compelling higher-stakes choices like final lie to Malachi. Interiority concrete via gripping fob under time pressure, with micro-choices revealing values. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses, but final success earned with competence balanced by timed struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: false starts because/therefore lead to lie revealing traitor, culminating in on-page DC (fob captures shattering silence) with cost (truce broken, shots imminent). Orientation anchored early (pier, market, Eliza's position). Single continuous scene tightens meaningfully at back-room confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rotting pier and creaking wood constrain movement and soothe via "familiar cloak," mirroring internal state; damp sea air evokes urgency as "time slipping." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hushed negotiations noticed amid goal). Recurring pier charges escape image, guiding choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture sound) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven lie narrowing options (exposes traitor before sunrise). Escalation causal under lens, with visible cost (truce fracture) charging final image. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization in fob extension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust's sonic fracture emerges organically from fob-attuned capture, reweighting "comforting unease" in final collection image without statement. Subtext in whispers and silence implies complexity of betrayal's allure. Resonant non-literal answer via heirloom containing "uncatchable."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing unease as soothing); voice modulates rhythm with intensity (short urgent sentences at climax). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Word is, Malachi's hired..."), advances plot via misdirection. No head-hopping, diction POV-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "gripping the watch fob tighter" advances emotion/action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels (read-aloud flows from hushed to humming climax). Minor label phrasing ("curiously steadfast") but no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes moonshine/pirate tropes with sonic capture of abstract "trust breaking," feeling inevitable via fob's attunement. Risky quirkiness (recording silence) heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle transforms familiar smuggling into perceptual quest.</comment>
