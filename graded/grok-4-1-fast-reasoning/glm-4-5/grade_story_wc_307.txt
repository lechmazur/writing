<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elien's motivation as teacher rooted in his backwards aging ties to rejuvenation payoff, earning Maya's mastery with felt cost; contradictory trust/confusion impulses act in her questions and nod.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripple patterns deepen trance to CR closure (Maya's fade/intensify, Elien's decade return) with conceptual cost legible in "payment for wisdom shared."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Floating platform and grotto constrain revelation (trembles with energy, glows under starlight), charging final image; selective sensory hush mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master vanishing/appearing) signaled early, deepens via stone ripples narrowing to realization; agency in Maya's precise throw and demand forecloses premature truth with felt paradox cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Paradox of vanishing to appear emerges organically via ripples and grotto; minor penalty for "through the patterns... wisdom emerges" thematic echo articulating thesis mid-climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Elien-dominant) with perceptual hush signature; dialogue goal-driven (e.g., "Show me") carries subtext, distinct voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("vanishing to appear" thrice, sycamore hush repeated) and template smiles; density propels but rhythm dips in reflective restatements pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards aging with meditative paradox transforms tropes; risk in grotto reveal heightens stakes organically to inevitable rejuvenation.</comment>
