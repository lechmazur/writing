<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses from arrogant past to humble fidgeting-into-meditation act in scene; self-forgiveness earned via decoding causality, with 40-year penance cost legible in prince reconciliation. Interiority concrete and chess-pattern particular. Final reflection marks change without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from thread-decoding to door-forming/tapestry restoration, culminating in on-page RR (time restarts) with felt cost of decades' humility. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph. Lens taught early via lull/thunder pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth walls shimmer responsively, constraining focus and charging final image; time-frozen statues and thunder lull pressure choices via 4-to-2-minute countdown. Sensory selection (hush absorbing sound) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (tapestry border) guides decoding intimately.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness/redemption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timed decoding tightening (last thread snaps hush), forcing humility renunciation with visible 40-year/exile cost. Agency in micro-choices narrows pride path. Protagonist alteration drives gentle time-stream closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of strategy-to-redemption emerges organically from chess-tutor patterns and thread-reframing; final village awakening reweights pride/humility without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fidgeting evolution. Counter-reading (prince's understanding) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (strategic pattern-noticing in threads/labyrinth); rhythmic control modulates from productive fidget to fierce repose. Voice chess-inflected and consistent under timed pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor patterned loops ("productive fidgeting" x4, "distant thunder" x3, "woven hush" x3) create slight synonym churn but tie to accumulative texture without obscuring closure; rhythm varies with urgency. High density integrates action/reflection. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-tutor decoding time-prison via humility-test labyrinth transforms redemption trope; tapestry threads as memory-strategy inevitable in hindsight. Risky calm introspection heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
