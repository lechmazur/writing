<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No interiority or micro-choices shown; all traits told ("strangely trustworthy nature," "altruistic ghost"). Characters function as archetypes without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion acting in scene. Motivations compel no on-page higher-stakes decisions, flattening to summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred (pattern of messages building to communal revival); holds to CR closure in final image of "tangled roots...forever thriving" with conceptual cost of isolation foreclosed. Violates defaults with multi-generational chronicle lacking tight mosaic pattern or legible transitions. Causality told via summary, not linkage; orientation anchored early (~50 words).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches recur to frame setting and charge final monuments image, constraining communal scale implicitly. Sensory details selective (violet sunsets, nebula glow mirroring uncertainty). Integrated purposefully without stalls; recurring anchors evolve to symbols of triumph.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchards failing, community survival) signaled early; accumulative tightening at bell discovery narrows to collective action with felt cost (barrenness endured). Pressure coheres via repeated messages; communal agency forces crystallization, though dramatized abstractly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust/cooperation emerges organically from particulars (messages to revival); final solstice message offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting strangers-to-family arc. Subtext in ghostly bridge avoids moralizing; complexity in "brambled hope" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable omniscient POV with distinct poetic texture (e.g., "ghost of Elion continued tending gardens"); perceptual signature world/family-focused. Rhythmic control modulates from satisfaction to resilient hope; no head-hopping despite group focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "elegant script appeared...leading many to attribute"); rhythm varies naturally. Purposeful repetition ("strangers become family") motif-taught avoids loops; minor paraphrase in message descriptions (−0.2), but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchards/ghost chalk messages transforms tropes; butterfly larvae mist ingenuous pivot. Risk in generational scope heightens communal stakes organically; no derivative templates.</comment>
