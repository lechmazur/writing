<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to reconstitute the crystal roots in consistent intuitive traits and intensifies via shadow guidance; embodied emotion peaks in "breath caught" during climax. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating choices, leaning competent without struggle. Final reconstitution earned by prior mirror glimpses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from past mirror visits to on-page reconstitution; closure as RR/Charged Poise lands when "crystal down into her waiting hands, the soft hum... vibrating against her skin" reconfigures stakes with felt energy cost. Orientation anchored early in orchard/cliffs. One tightening via visualization to manifestation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via shadows swirling around fragment and lighthouse beam illuminating climax; ice floes "groaned as the tide shifted, matching the ancient rhythm" mirrors internal magic. Sensory hierarchy biased to shadows/light; vivid, integrated without stalls. Micro-setting (apple trees shuddering) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute to prove abilities against elders' skepticism) signaled early; Accumulative deepening when fragment lifts and grows, narrowing to success with energy pulse cost. Agency in tracing patterns forces stance crystallization. No major reversals needed; pressure coheres to charged closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming understanding (empathy to action) emerges via mirrors to reconstitution; final image resonates without literal moral. "Weighted breath" motif shifts to exhaled proof, but repeated phrasing nears thematic echo. Complexity in anomalous magic vs. convention lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadows as "comforting embrace"; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates to purple glow at peak without leakage. Voice texture distinct in selective noticing (moonlight facets, ice groans). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive "weighted breath" (3x) and shadow synonyms ("deepened, wrapping, swirling") create paraphrase loops dulling density; overwriting in climax ("purple and deep, like the twilight hour when shadows rule but light has not fully surrendered") mixes metaphors without payoff. Rhythm varies but figurative muddle in peak beat obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow magic via vintage mirrors defies convention organically; reconstitutes crystal trope through intuitive glimpses. Bold fantasy risks (time-pulled pieces) heighten stakes without gimmickry; final hum inevitable from particulars.</comment>
