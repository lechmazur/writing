<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in alchemical persistence, with contradictory impulses between wishes and deeper transformation embodied in sketching plans overnight. Final change earned via prior reflection on colleagues and bottle. Minor summary in emotional progression slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from contemplation to manifesto, culminating in CR closure where Elior's posting notices reconfigures town potential with conceptual cost of "difficult work." Orientation anchored early in workshop. One tightening via bottle metaphor insight narrows to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective details like glowing paper lanterns contrast hollow spirit, mirroring internal shift; bay window and town square guide progression from solitude to outreach. Bottle as micro-setting charges final image, constraining reflective choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of spiritual revival signaled early, tightens accumulatively through rejection of wishes to crystallized plan with felt cost in embracing "difficult work together." Agency in conception and posting forecloses passive path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of material vs. spiritual transformation emerges organically via bottle metaphor shift and final community image, reweighting wishes as insufficient. Minor direct statement in closing lines borders thematic echo but resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in alchemical noticing (e.g., "swirling shadows"); rhythmic modulation builds reflective density to poised close. No dialogue; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops around "false comfort" and "paper lanterns" slightly dull mid-section momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical metaphor for community revival transforms ghost town trope; bottle's reinterpretation feels inevitable and risks bold conceptual pivot.</comment>
