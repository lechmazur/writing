<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via touch ("fingers traced the synthetic feathers") and wry self-doubt ("steadier hands than I had yesterday"), with blindness as balanced flaw driving unique competence; motivation to support apprentice earned via repair choice, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from diagnosis to repair; on-page Charged Poise closure in drone whirring and phone buzz confirming "just in time," reconfiguring shore-sea connection with felt time cost legible in "steam from the departing ship would soon clear the morning mist."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and depot vividly constrain pace ("mist seemed to slow time itself") and charge final image as it thins with sun/ship departure; sensory hierarchy via blind POV (touch/sounds dominant, light inferred through water) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timely drone repair for apprentice/ship) signaled early via recognition, tightens accumulatively through diagnosis then patching under time pressure from creaking rigging; agency in micro-choices forecloses failure path with "just in time" cost felt but not viscerally deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transcending blindness via intuition emerges organically from water refraction repair to final "perceived what other sighted people could not," reweighting premise in ship/depot image without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in connections across distance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single blind-POV with perceptual signature (touch/refraction over sight) and rhythmic modulation ("magnetic calm" diction persists under purpose); purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., mist carries sounds while slowing time); varied rhythm suits lyric accumulative mode, minor figurative density ("neurons bridging an injury," "ballet in miniature") purposeful without muddling closure, no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ironic blind artisan using light-water refraction transforms repair trope freshly; premise synthesis (drone links depot/ship) feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold perceptual risk heightening stakes/coherence.</comment>
