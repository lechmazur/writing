<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation burns cold and constant, compelling the central act of pressing the puppet head to the spindle; embodied exhaustion at climax earns resolute endurance. Minor slip in contradictory impulses, as struggle feels more procedural than internally torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of whispers and vibrations builds to Resonant Reconfiguration; clock's stutter-then-pulse delivers Charged Poise closure with legible exhaustion cost in "stepped back, exhausted but resolute."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pane of hush and churning ocean constrain whispers and amplify hum, charging final beam sweep; selective sensory filter (visual bruises, absorbed roar) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of securing time's transition tightens via clock shudder forcing intensified focus; agency in sigil-tracing and head-pressing forecloses entropy path with embodied cost, though abstract scale dilutes visceral bite slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fragile defiance against oblivion emerges organically from flaw-as-key and persistent whisper; final glowing crack reweights hush with non-literal resonance of quiet resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "bruised purple and orange hues" and rhythmic hush-modulation; voice texture heightens pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor repetition loops ("pane of hush," "beautifully flawed") dull two peak sentences without obscuring closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic clock tuned by flawed puppet flaw transforms doomsday trope; risk in lyric mechanism pays off in inevitable whisper's persistence.</comment>
