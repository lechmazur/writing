<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's contradictory skepticism and wonder drive micro-choices like placing the tooth and bone setting; final yielding to touch feels earned by seven-year backstory anchored in present ritual. Vulnerability in Arthur's "My bones need setting" reveals relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual motions accumulate to tooth vibration and figure's emergence as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure in hands joining with glimpsed constellation cost to certainty. Orientation anchored early in maze/garden; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Secret garden's moonpetals and perpetual twilight constrain ritual and charge final boundary-softening image; sensory details like iridescent tooth and humming integrate via POV bias toward dimensional theories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring Arthur tightens via blurring edges and figure's reach, forcing stance shift; agency in instinctive bone setting on air forecloses skeptical path with renewal cost legible in "skepticism finally yielding to wonder."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forgiveness over skepticism emerges via particulars like tooth exchange and echoed "turning mistakes into constellations," reweighting premise in final hand-join without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in Arthur's in-between nature lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in scientific-mystical filter; dialogue subtextual ("Building") advances goal; rhythmic modulation peaks in blurring edges without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion; minor overwriting in "nostalgic innovation" metaphors purposeful for tone, no loops dulling closure image of dissolving tooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with bone setting across realms transforms tropes; risk in maze ritual and constellation motif inevitable from setup, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
