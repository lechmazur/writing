<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia is embodied in "twisted her shoulders uncomfortably" and "deep breaths," contradicting her determination in humming through "pain erupted along her spine," earning the final step; prudently adventurous trait shown via risk calculation vs. action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: compass activation because of fallow nexus positioning therefore leads to transfix and portal DC; closure cost legible in "clattered to the stone ground, its purpose fulfilled" as she leaves underground world; orientation anchored by ~100 words; no shards, single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nexus under starlight constrains center positioning and starlight-weaving; body as micro-setting in spine pain and tingling fingers charges transfix; sensory narrowing to "air grew thick and viscous" under crisis; runes and pillars evolve with portal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spatial mutiny for freedom) tightens via causal agency: humming endures transfix pain, foreclosing return as portal to unexpected realm crystallizes stance; cost in traitor risk and compass abandonment unmistakable on final step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion emerges via grandfather memories shifting to resolute portal embrace, reweighting confinement theme in final image without moralizing; ambiguity in unexpected realm invites reflection on freedom's unknowns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobic compression to infinite expanse); rhythmic modulation peaks in short "She struggled..."; no dialogue; diction biased to explorer's sensory priors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like compass humming into glowing/weaving; varied syntax accelerates transfix ("The tiny instrument hovered... spinning slowly"); zero loops, no artifacts dulling closure clatter image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of compass as generational "metal insect-like device" enabling mutiny defies portal tropes via organ hum and fallow physics; risk in unexpected realm payoff feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
