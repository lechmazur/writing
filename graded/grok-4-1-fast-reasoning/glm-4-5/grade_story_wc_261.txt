<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation as closure seeker rooted in scar-reading trait drives actions consistently, with embodied shiver revealing telepathy burden; internal conflict between excavation and integration emerges via plant voices and patterns. Diagnostic label-speak in realization lines ("closure didn't come from opening wounds") undercuts embodied crisis feel, treating epiphany as tidy therapy insight rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (coffee rings, scars, plants) tightens to tunnel reveal as one meaningful deepening, with CR closure via integration realization reweighting premise; hourglass emptying provides legible conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored early in tower at dawn post-anesthesia. No shards exceed scope; causality intact via motivated object examinations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting (chilled stones like scars, arrow-slit dawn light) constrains choice—rings match stone spirals for wall press—and charges final empty hourglass/coffee reflection image. Sensory details (frosted cold, plant hum, glow) selective via POV bias toward scar-stories, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Atmosphere's meteor hush evolves with dawn, supporting lyric tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (read scars for closure/healing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as patterns cohere to force tunnel stance; agency in gripping hourglass/examining rings narrows options with telepathy burden as felt cost. One tightening via aligned patterns reweights knowledge toward integration; final emergence forecloses excavation path with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of integration over excavation emerges organically from scar patterns, plant resilience, and miracle return, with final coffee reflection offering non-literal resonant answer recharging prior images. Subtext in whispers and hourglass warmth layers complexity without binaries; earned via concrete particulars, though border-line thematic echo in "path to healing wasn't meant to be opened" risks slight sermon feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tuned to object scars/stories; lyrical voice texture (e.g., "dawn stretched its fingers") modulates rhythmically, compressing insight under dawning pressure. Purposeful poetic diction taught early sustains lyric mode without opacity; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "displaced miracle," "opening wounds," and healing refrains across reflective blocks dull density, with synonym churn in final third (e.g., "stories they told," "stories in scars") touching closure image; therapy-speak labels in peak realizations add artifact drag. Rhythms vary but template cadence in epiphanic sentences ("She understood now," "Elara realized") creates drumbeat. Information density strong elsewhere via integrated images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-reading telepathy, coffee-ring temporal map, and plant-voiced miracle transforms time-tunnel trope into lyric healing metaphor grounded in object particulars. Risky accumulative pattern of pattern-reading pays off inevitably at integration CR; no derivative echoes, bold perceptual specificity memorable.</comment>
