<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to share wisdom crystallizes accumulatively but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany of "profound connection" feels diagnostic rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via buttons matching echo swirls to CR closure; prophecy reconfiguration reweights solitary work with communal cost legible in warehouse transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber light, shadows, and button corner constrain cataloging choices and charge final communal image; recurring warehouse/echo integrate purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unscrambling prophecy deepens via button patterns under accumulative lens, narrowing impossible task to possibilities; cost felt in shift from solitary measurement to sharing, though abstract initially.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shared wisdom emerges organically from button choices mirroring prophecy possibilities; prophecy line "wisdom grows when shared" articulates theme directly, diluting subtext resonance in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns/resonance; rhythmic prose modulates from solitary hush to communal hum without leakage or generic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "amber warehouse beneath the cliffs" (repeated 5x) and "truth unraveled"/"unearth silence" create synonym churn dulling density; template cadence in "As [noun] [verb-ed]" runs across beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo/buttons/prophecy transforms trope of lost artifact into communal possibility; button sequences as choices feel inevitable and non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
