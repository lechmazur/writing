<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to fledge and inscribe cosmic verse intensifies consistently from dance to anchoring; transformation earned with embodied cost in roots extending, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the pivotal anchoring beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from dance to gap observation to inscription; CR closure lands on-page in "skin now a manuscript" with legible mobility cost, orientation anchored early in garden under stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's forbidden flowers/scents and earth constrain anchoring roots and charge final transformed image; sensory details (pulsing speck, starlight glow) selective via POV's tidal bias, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transcending ban via flegging signaled early, escalates accumulatively through speck/gap tightening that forces mobility trade-off; cost unmistakable in "sacrifice of mobility for profound vision."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation vs. erasure emerges organically through inscription symbols as "rebellion against forgetting"; final image non-literally reweights premise with cosmic permanence, ambiguity in exile's sacred choice lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature tuned to tides/moonlight/gaps; distinct rhythmic texture modulates from flowing dance to still inscription without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in transformation beat, varied rhythm; figurative density peaks coherently in "luminous ink weaving," minor slips in "gaps" recurrence but pattern-taught without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia ban, tide dance, and gap-observation flegging into skin-manuscript; risk-taking in mythic lyricism heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early motifs.</comment>
