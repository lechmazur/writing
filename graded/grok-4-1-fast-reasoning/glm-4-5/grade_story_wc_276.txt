<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving patient actions like zigzagging; cool head prevents unraveling at climax. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, relying on declarative traits over embodied conflict. Final smile and rest feel earned but not deeply micro-tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden navigation to net-weaving climax. On-page Charged Poise closure in echo capture and garden settling, with cost in subtle transformations ("rail spike... hummed... softer, more alive"). Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden vividly constrains choices ("unstable terrain of the shifting auditory blooms"), sensory hierarchy via fisher's priorities. Charges final image as it "settle[s]... subtly enriched." Purposeful selection mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early; textural escalation via density increase in weaving (constellations stir uneasily). One tightening at final zigzag secures echo, narrowing to success with agency. Cost legible in changes to fisher, spike, garden, but subtle rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of touching ineffable emerges organically from particulars (voicing silence creates space). Final images reweight premise: legacy in resonance, fisher changed "as all divine encounters change." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in subtle influence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (patient heart's logic in random-seeming patterns). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/imagery; figurative language consistent in sound-garden pattern without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in zigzag/emotion motifs (−0.4), but purposeful and non-obscuring. Propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fishing metaphor with synesthetic sound-emotion world; tropes transformed via transliteration attribute. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes coherently; final echo legacy feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
