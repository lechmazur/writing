<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas's bloodhound traits and motivation to find Elara drive consistent micro-choices like decoding grooves, earning the reunion; internal conflict emerges in dormant senses awakening under journey pressure. Limited embodied contradiction in pivotal decoding moment, but no unearned epiphanies. Final endurance of separation costs felt in preserved leaf handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: riddle decoding therefore journey to markers therefore reunion CR at leaves-together message revealing "Home is not a place..."; one tightening at seventh marker shifts course northeast. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard/settlement. Closure cost legible in foreclosed eastward path and emotional separation repriced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wasteland cracks, scrapyard metal valleys, and drone skeleton constrain route and filter through bloodhound eyes; leaf as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details like "mechanical breathing" and "tarpaulins shifting" integrate purposefully. No white-room; post-war rules consistent via salvage/tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite via decoding) signaled early, tightens causally at cylinder riddle narrowing to northeast coordinates; agency in following grooves forecloses prior path with felt separation cost. Journey pressure coheres without coincidence resolution. Final image crystallizes trade-off of physical distance for shared truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of closeness via shared knowledge emerges organically from leaf/groove decoding to dual-leaf message; final image reweights premise without stating moral. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "tinted revelations" lingers. Resonance from bloodhound shift: dead to life.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with bloodhound perceptual bias (color subtleties in grooves); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to anticipation at valley smoke. No head-hopping; diction like "wild hush" consistent. Voice particular via sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "run his fingers over the waxy surface as if memorizing every ridge and vein" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies without monotony. Minor paraphrase loops in "tinted revelations" (3x) but purposeful motif, not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: bloodhound vision decoding phonograph spectrum via leaf transforms post-apoc tropes into fresh riddle-trail; risk of summary journey pays off in charged CR. Irreplaceable groove-reading mechanic heightens stakes organically.</comment>
