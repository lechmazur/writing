<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's feigned foolishness with the official reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, earning her final coded chart; motivation roots in consistent cosmic-listening trait, intensifying to subtle disruptions. Interiority concrete via hands and needle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from galactic alignment to synchronized delays, landing CR closure in the chart's coded messages with conceptual cost of unseen agency. One tightening via "adjacent possibilities" suffices; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory, autumn winds, and eternal candle constrain her workspace and charge final image, filtering through her tactile priorities; sensory hierarchy narrows to flame swells and crimson leaves amid revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart coup via patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to chart's disruptions narrowing conspirators' options; agency in embroidery forecloses direct confrontation with felt cost of feigned eccentricity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of subtle cosmic whispers vs. earthly power emerges via embroidery patterns, resonating in final chart without statement; "foolish-seeming embroiderer" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile star-threads; dialogue to official carries subtext of disguise, natural and goal-driven; rhythmic prose modulates with revelation intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "needle connected threads," varying rhythm; minor overwriting in shadows/ accomplices but pattern-taught without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embroiderer decoding conspiracies via "adjacent possibilities" synthesizes fresh cosmic subversion; risk in feigned foolishness heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
