<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy intensifies credibly through years of study to the trembling-fingers climax; interiority particular via fragment's warmth and hum. Earned change from seeker to translator via on-page touch. Minor deduction for limited contradictory impulses in single-POV reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective shards build density to CR closure when fragment solidifies, reweighting elusive quest with legacy cost in "histories long overlooked flood into the present." Orientation anchored immediately in market; one tightening at painting touch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Market's swaying stalls and glowing potions selectively sensory, mirroring internal suspension; fragment-as-micro-setting constrains touch and charges final glow. Lighthouse painting evolves via dots to constellations, mirroring states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unfasten histories signaled early, tightens accumulatively via warming fragment to on-page reveal; agency in touch forecloses elusive past with solidification cost. Price legible in "no longer elusively tangible but fully present."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of generational bridging emerges organically from fragment/painting particulars, reweighting childhood find in final "perfect circle of understanding" without moralizing. Resonant CR invites ambiguity on legacy burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mystical diction ("shift between solidity and vapor," "colors swirl and merge") biases toward hidden patterns; rhythmic modulation peaks at closure without head-hopping. Voice coheres as translator's intuitive texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (e.g., "elusively tangible") taught early, propels to closure without loops dulling image; varied rhythm reads aloud fluidly. Minor −0.5 for clustered repetitions bordering paraphrase in reflective blocks, not touching climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical artifact quest in airborne alchemist market transforms trope via painting-deciphering legacy; "dots along the horizon" to constellations inflects hindsight inevitability. Risky lyric structure heightens without gimmick.</comment>
