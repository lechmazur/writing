<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in family legacy, compelling travel and revelation; interiority embodied in trembling hands and fingertip tracing. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal cathedral scene, reducing depth of micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from postcards to cathedral etchings toward CR closure ("dawning hush of understanding" reweights premise with conceptual cost of transformed vision). One tightening via postcard discovery narrows inquiry; orientation anchored early in pavilion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and cathedral glass vividly selective, sensory (cooling glass, moonlight prisms); etched window constrains revelation and charges final image. Mirrors internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nocturnal blooming mystery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via postcard-to-cathedral deepening that changes knowledge; agency in patient examination forecloses prior confusion with felt opportunity cost in devoted nights. Caretaker access adds subtle pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of light transformation emerges organically from glass/flowers interplay, resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing ("hidden symphony of light and life"). Complexity in environmental perception avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature (noticing light patterns); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet obsession to profound hush. No dialogue to judge; elisions purposeful in reflective mode.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, density high in revelation; minor paraphrase loops ("dawning hush" reprise, autumn transitions) and heavy figurative layering slightly dull peak etchings beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mural art, postcards, and cathedral glass transforms nocturnal flower trope into perceptual revelation; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
