<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength in concrete interiority like seed's "subtle vibration against her skin like a second heartbeat," revealing motivation rooted in lineage; contradictory impulses between cosmic pull and methodical restraint act in scene without alternating summaries. Final endurance of responsibility earned by prior contrasts with predecessors. Minor limit: no on-page micro-choices under acute stress, all reflective calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of analogies building to Charged Poise closure in final paragraph's continuum realization, reconfiguring loneliness with felt cost of isolation foreclosed. Orientation anchored early (Elara post-spirit, study). One tightening via analogical connections narrows to Pamir journey; no shard excess fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "cluttered study surrounded by dictionaries" and arbor's "branches crackling with static energy... shimmer like a heat mirage" filter through Elara's scholarly bias, constraining choices (packing for anomalies). Arbor image charges final pulsing seed. Sensory hierarchy matches calm reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant seed at arbor) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via analogies changing knowledge/options for Pamir vessel; internal pressure from haunted predecessors forces stance toward purpose. Cost legible in "exhilarated and terrified." No on-page reversal or antagonist limits escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transition (matter/energy, ambition/purpose) emerges organically from seed/arbor particulars and lineage conflicts, without statements; final "unbroken continuum" offers resonant CR reweighting isolation without moral. Subtext in respectful knowledge distance lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in analogical noticing (e.g., arbor to magnetic stones); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to purposeful, diction character-specific (scholarly precision). No dialogue or head-hopping; elisions purposeful for forward drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., seed description advances stakes/emotion); varied rhythm suits accumulative build. Minor paraphrase loops in "methodical precision" repetitions across paragraphs dull mid-section slightly (−0.4). No closure artifacts; strong verbs, no muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform lore and atmospheric physics via arbor/seed transforms tropes organically; risk in analogical escalation feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Final continuum image particular and memorable.</comment>
