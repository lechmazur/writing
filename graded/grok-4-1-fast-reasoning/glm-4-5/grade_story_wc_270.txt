<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in insurgency and plant telepathy compels decoding and unsealing; contradictory dismissal of prophecies resolves in earned realization when holding embryo. Minor flaw: epiphany at "infuse it with the wisdom" leans toward diagnostic summary over embodied micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links from plant guidance to kite discovery, decoding, and chamber opening as DC closure with conceptual cost in evolved tradition. Orientation anchored early in hot springs; kite's gust strains motivated ellipsis but does not break chain. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs vividly constrain via steam-parting and geothermal power, charging final chamber crack; ferns/mosses mirror telepathy. Sensory selection (warm rock pulse, hissing crevice) reflects Maya's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unseal chamber) tightens via kite decoding reversal, narrowing options with weeks of frustration cost; agency in speaking words forces crystallization. Kite gust complicates as near-coincidence but escalates decoding under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges organically from plant visions, kite script, and embryo purpose; final image reconfigures prophecy skepticism without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in "honor both her heritage and her vision."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in plant "whispers" and fern "humming"; diction modulates from frustration to poised understanding. No dialogue; rhythmic control peaks in thunderous chamber crack.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of plants charging telepathy; varied rhythm accelerates in decoding to sealing. Minor paraphrase loop in reflection blocks ("destiny" echoed twice closely) but does not dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic flora, amber embryo, and kite-script key transforms prophecy trope into organic destiny evolution; risk in plant agency heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from fern guidance to final hum.</comment>
