<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pianist's motivation rooted in daughter's loss and clock anomaly compels descent and refuge choice with embodied emotion in weaving lullaby; internal conflict of prior acceptance vs. tonight's resolve shown but not deeply simultaneous in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via clock anomaly → research → film threading → "he stepped forward into the projected light, he disappeared," landing DC closure with legible conceptual cost of time defiance in liminal refuge for lost daughter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's swaying boughs and dipping branches with evening tide constrain descent timing and navigation risk, charging final projected light image as micro-setting for refuge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of evading shutdown via refuge signaled early; causal tightening in "horizon began to deepen... concluded his performance" then descent narrows options, with agency and felt risk cost in improvised path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of broken wholeness emerges organically from clock, film, and loss; final "bridge between what was and what could yet be" image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close voice with musical perceptual signature ("fingers danced across the ivory keys," "melodies flowing") stable and modulating tension in descent; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel from performance to climax without loops; opening figurative cluster ("danced... flowing... echoed... swayed") risks overwriting but integrates without dulling peak projector threading.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Film-reel hidden sections as time refuge, seeded arbors premise synthesizes fresh sci-fant with causal inevitability; risk-taking in liminal encore heightens emotional stakes coherently.</comment>
