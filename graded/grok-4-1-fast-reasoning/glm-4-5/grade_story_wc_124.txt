<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (aromatic caution vs. pressing need for answers) act in scene via UV lantern use; final embrace of grief earned by accumulating scent revelations with embodied tears as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent layers densify to Conceptual Repricing closure ("impact of memories... illuminating what was lost"); cost legible in "tears to fall freely" and extinguished lantern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse and orchid constrain vial/lantern positioning and time pressure; recurring ghost orchid charges final transformation image alongside vial in display case.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sensory mystery) signaled early tightens via scent-deepening cadence shift under accumulative lens; protagonist agency in UV activation forecloses avoidance path with grief cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intertwined grief/love emerges organically from scent particulars and light/shadow motifs; final image of vial between ferns offers non-literal resonant reweighting without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (aroma/light bias via "crystal shadows," "molecular structure"); rhythmic modulation heightens revelations without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in scent layers; minor paraphrase loop on "tears" and "transformation" slightly dulls peak propulsion but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of UV-revealed molecular memories in extinct-plant greenhouse transforms lantern-broker trope; risk in aromatic grief premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
