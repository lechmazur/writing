<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via lunar pull, compelling tuning choice; weakness in abstract interiority ("discarding assumptions") lacks embodied contradiction until late, reducing peak authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("every conclusion contains the seed"); cost legible in released assumptions reconfiguring perception, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower/gorge constrain ascent and reception; shard and fragment as micro-settings charge final hum image; sensory details (wind, glow, silence) filtered through interpreter's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful tuning) signaled early, deepens via shard silence narrowing to intention under accumulative lens; cost felt in assumption discard foreclosing old mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth in endings emerges via fragment's journey and city awakening; resonant CR image reweights premise, minor thematic echo in final line slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmic signals, energy pulses); lyrical rhythm modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("discarding assumptions," hush repetitions) across reflective beats dull propulsion; strong density and varied rhythm otherwise, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hollywood star fragment ingeniously synthesizes cosmic/cultural decay-rebirth; suspended city over gorge transforms trope into fresh, grounded fantasy with risk-taking payoff.</comment>
