<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mage's earnestly naive traits compel micro-choices like tracing bell fractures and obsessing over dripping, with lukewarm powers as visible flaw creating struggle; final power surge earns change via embodied devotion without tidy epiphany, though internal conflict leans declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dripping observation to spectral rebuild; on-page closure via RR (bell's silent ring stirring sea) with conceptual cost of prior shattered faith legible in "echoes and empty nets"; orientation anchored in opening lines, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct and dripping water selectively constrain rebuild (rates as pattern source) and charge final image ("liquid sky"); dawn light integrates into action, mirroring internal realignment without tourist catalog; sensory hierarchy fits mage's magical focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (right imbalance via bell) tightens accumulatively through dripping understanding narrowing rebuild options; agency in tireless weaving forecloses failure path with felt cost of devotion; one decisive deepening suffices, charging sea's stir as payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of naive devotion mending impossibility emerges organically from mage's actions and final lukewarm toll reweighting cosmic premise; resonant non-literal close in mage's warming powers avoids moralizing, though "great cosmic dance" edges platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (magical sensing of water rhythm); rhythmic prose modulates from mumbled naivety to surging intensity, diction purposeful and biased toward cosmic metaphors; no dialogue, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "settling stars" advancing texture, but "brittle devotion" paraphrases twice in opening without new pressure (-0.4); rhythm varies, syntax propels to closure image; minor synonym churn in "fractured" bell descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dripping as cosmic code transforms mage trope into water-rebuilt bell; risk in "impossible but plausible" method pays off at surge without gimmick; irreplaceable viaduct-dawn choreography heightens ingenuity.</comment>
