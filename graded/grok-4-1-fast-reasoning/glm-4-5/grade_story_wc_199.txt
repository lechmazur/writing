<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in lifelong sorting and folklore compels decoding stake, with embodied emotions like tingling skin; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as work feels competent but unpressured. Transformation endurance earns mild closure cost via repeated tingles, but no pivotal internal micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to moonstone discovery ("glint of something unusual") tightening clarity for decoding; closure as Charged Poise in monument placement and prophecy warning reconfigures cycle with felt transformation cost. Orientation anchored early in arbor hush; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (stained fingers prodding pods, arbor's pulsing glow) filters through sorter's priorities, constraining choices via platform/tray; recurring monument charges final image as beacon, mirroring internal attunement without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding leaves) signaled early, with moonstone discovery as one accumulative tightening narrowing to clear warning; agency in arranging patterns, but external pressure mild—coherent yet low visceral cost beyond abstract winds/shifting skies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of prophetic cycles emerges organically from seed monuments and leaf patterns, with final scroll/monument offering resonant CR to transformation question via "whispers of next year's transformation"; subtext in folklore avoids morals, lingering in becoming/unbecoming ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (seed essences, leaf spirals); lyrical texture modulates rhythmically, prose as character in nature-attuned diction; purposeful repetition of "hush" taught early enhances cadence without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor loops in "emerges transformed always" and "hush where past meets prophecy" repeats create template cadence across descriptions; no closure harm, figurative consistency (swirling light universes) purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sorter-as-prophet via moonstone speck and seed monuments transforms folklore trope organically; risk in solo fantasy scene heightens quiet ingenuity, with final cycle image inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
