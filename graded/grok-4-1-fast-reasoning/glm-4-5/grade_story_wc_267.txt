<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied nerve tingles and trembling hand; motivation intensifies from job to ritual reversal, earning the singing choice with numbness cost. Minor slip: epiphany on fortress's call feels slightly summaried rather than fully dramatized in the bolt pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from discoloration to warmth to humming walls; closure as Charged Poise in singing note reconfigures silence with legible cost in "fingers still numb... heart overflowing." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt walls and snowfall constrain via ethereal light and cold, mirroring internal frostbitten hope; spiral step discoloration as micro-setting triggers inciting incident and charges final snow-dance image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation safety vs. music freedom) signaled early, escalates via bolt discovery narrowing to singing reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in tracing melody forecloses sanctuary path with numbness cost on climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety's silence cost emerges organically from particulars like etched names and pulsing light; final shimmering walls offer resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musician-biased perception (bolt smoothness, melody fragments); rhythmic prose modulates from measured steps to halting tune, maintaining perceptual signature under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, climax clean of loops. Minor overwrite in "seraphically mundane" phrasing slightly elevates diction without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musician sacrifice ritual in fortress premise, transformed via nerve regen and bolt discovery; risk in quiet singing reversal heightens stakes organically.</comment>
