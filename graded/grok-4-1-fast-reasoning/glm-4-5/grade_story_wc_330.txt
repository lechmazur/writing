<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation rooted in 20-year persistence compels song despite fear, with embodied contradiction in "fear warred with desire"; change earned via fragment's urge. Interiority concrete in heartbeat and instincts. Minor epiphanic summary at end slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/mist builds to oasis/song RR (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost of broken silence legible in final wind bell image. Orientation anchored early in train/carpenter. One tightening via fragment → wrong turn → magic suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Oasis contrast to decaying train constrains discovery and charges closure image of rebirth. Sensory hush/chimes selective via POV priorities. Micro-setting (fragment, ivy wall) guides pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) signaled early, deepens via fragment's pulse narrowing to song agency; fear cost felt on page. Textural escalation to crescendo coherent under lens. One tightening forecloses silence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from hush-to-symphony arc; final wind bell reweights silence non-literally with lingering ambiguity/cost. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like fragment dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in gleams/silences; voice modulates poetically with intensity. Rhythmic texture fits misting hush without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("pulsing with a whispering gleam") during discovery but pattern-taught and legible. No loops; propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism synthesis of circus abandonment and silence quest; wrong turn/oasis inflects tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
