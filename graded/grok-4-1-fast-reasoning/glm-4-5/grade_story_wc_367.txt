<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide humanity post-collapse roots consistently in her routine and worry over prophetic laughter, with embodied contradictions like "shadowed elation" showing joy weighted by responsibility. Interiority feels particular through laughter as intuition, peaking in her whispered vow. Final endurance of her post despite risks earns closure without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via routine density, holds to Charged Poise closure in final smile and murmur reweighting her prophetic role with felt responsibility cost. Orientation anchors Elara, lighthouse, post-collapse night by paragraph 2. One tightening via fleet storm deepens stakes without shards or breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass lantern wick as recurring object constrains choices (ignition, alignment) and charges final handling image. Sensory details like aurora pulse and beam on water filter through Elara's priorities, evolving with dawn cycle. Post-collapse specificity like migration charts grounds without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safe guidance signals early, tightens accumulatively with prophetic discovery and fleet pressure forcing beam adjustment. Agency in ritual forecloses failure path, cost legible in her worry over wrong predictions. Climax fleet passage bears visible success price in ongoing responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ancient wisdom redeeming tech collapse emerges organically from manuscript paths and beam steering, reweighted in final image without statement. Shadowed elation motif shifts from personal to collective hope, inviting ambiguity on prophecy risks. Resonance ties to Elara's arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in laughter/weather intuition, modulating rhythm from calm observation to echoed declarations under fleet pressure. Prose texture poetic yet biased to her herald view, no head-hopping. Her solo calls to wind carry subtext of isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "shadowed elation" (4x) and "ancient shadows" create minor paraphrase loops dulling peak density, with "spiral stairs" twice as template echo. Rhythm varies but overwriting in "total internal reflection" explanations slows propulsion. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prophetic laughter fused with glass wick and post-newspaper collapse yields fresh synthesis, transforming lighthouse trope into post-tech herald via ancient intuition. Risky tone of shadowed elation heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from routine buildup.</comment>
