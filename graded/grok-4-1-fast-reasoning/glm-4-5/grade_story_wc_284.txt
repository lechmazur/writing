<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotion (wind nipping untrusted fingers) and contradictory impulses (fractured spy vs. reclaiming purpose); micro-choices like carving snow codes and snapping pillbox earn final resolve with daughter-stake cost. Minor epiphanic summary ("accepting the fractures as maps") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (snow codes, pillbox) builds to Charged Poise closure in final snap-and-descent, reconfiguring fractures with legible cost of exile/loss. Single scene anchors orientation early (bluff, spring tilt); no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zephyr bluff mist/snow constrains carving (pre-thaw urgency) and charges final image (codes vanish like promise); sensory hierarchy (bitter wind, silver hush) mirrors internal fog-to-clarity via POV bias. Vivid, selective integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim courage/purpose for daughter) signaled early, tightens via photo view and code completion under accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance with felt cost (build around breaks). Agency in carving/snapping forecloses shadow-life path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (fixing broken = accept fractures as maps) emerges organically from snow codes/pillbox shift, resonant non-literal close reweights premise without moralizing. Pillbox reprise subtly charges ashes-to-growth motif; minor direct whisper edges from pure implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (spy-fractured lens on mist/codes); rhythmic texture modulates from hush to storm-whip to approval-whisper, reflecting intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; elision unnecessary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short resolve snaps vs. flowing reflections), high density, but minor paraphrase loops ("silver hush" x3, "tilt of the earth" x2) and figurative density without mid-beat payoff dull propulsion slightly; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Snow codes as self-dialogue transforms burned-spy redemption trope via lyric accumulation; fresh synthesis of bluff-crucible and pillbox-repurpose feels organic/inevitable, risking poetic over plot without gimmick.</comment>
