<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority summarizes epiphanies like "learning to carry it with grace" without embodied micro-choices under pressure; change feels told via backstory rather than earned on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with layering toward Charged Poise closure in final image of hands creating amid enduring loss; orientation anchored early in observatory and grief; vignette structure fits scope with legible conceptual repricing cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory and stencil constrain craft choices and charge renewal image; sensory details like "stars whispered secrets" filter through Elena's priorities without catalog; setting evolves subtly with her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-to-resilience deepens via accumulative density to endurance with felt cost of "heart still carried the weight"; no agency-driven reversal but pattern break in final reconfiguration suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Phoenix stencil and origami shift meaning to answer withering-to-bloom without moralizing; resonance emerges organically from craft images; avoids platitudes in scarred strength image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with craft-biased perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm modulates subdued tone; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "hands" phrasing across paragraphs creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion; minor overwriting in renewal metaphors like "withering to bloom again"; density functional but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy observatory transforms grief tropes via origami coordinates and soul curtains; synthesis of craft and interdimensional healing feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
