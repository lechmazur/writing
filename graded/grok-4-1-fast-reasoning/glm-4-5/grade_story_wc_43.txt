<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Therapist's serenity and kindness motivate clear micro-choices like placing the vinyl and playing louder, with embodied emotion in the room's stillness; son and wife's reactions reveal relational pressure. Interiority shows mild contradiction in witnessing imperfection as flawless, but leans toward diagnostic labels like "decisively kind" without raw crisis ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (scent, music, breathing) drives to CR closure where final whisper and eyes closing reconfigure fragments into wholeness with death's cost legible in son's relic-hold. Orientation anchors immediately in hospice rounds; single scene tightens once via louder playing honoring silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (lavender-cedar "scent of hope," guitar strings, breathing metronome) filters through therapist's priorities, constraining choices like chair arrangement; recurring vinyl fragment charges final image. "Radiant haven above the clouds" evolves metaphorically without static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye via music/reunification) signaled early, accumulates pressure through family arrival and son's denial-whisper tightening to foreclose "better times"; cost felt in persistent fragments post-death under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented love reunified emerges organically via vinyl, music, and scent without statement; final "space between notes where love lives on" offers non-literal CR repricing imperfection's wholeness. Minor pseudo-profundity in "ordinary magic" slightly abstracts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors and stillness motif; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, as in "pulsing stillness" repetition. Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in son's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in sensory-propelled lines; purposeful poetic repetition ("pulsing stillness," "radiant haven") taught early avoids loops. Minor elevated diction drift in "hymning the mundane" but no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice therapy via broken vinyl fragment transforms death trope into memory reunification; risk in metaphorical "haven above clouds" coheres as voice-driven frame heightening quiet closure stakes.</comment>
