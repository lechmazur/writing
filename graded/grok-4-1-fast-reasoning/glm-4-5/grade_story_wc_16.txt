<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in restoring trust drives her translations, with embodied details like trembling fingers showing cautious exuberance; however, "carefully reckless" remains mostly label-only without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal breakthrough moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure—gathering translations before presenting—with felt cost of potential dismissal legible in final preparation; orientation anchored early in archive, one continuous scene fits scope, minor redundancy in beats prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dust motes, scrolls, and glass ink well integrate selectively through her goal-directed actions, with ink well recurring to mirror dedication (nearly empty by evening); constrains choices via tactile use, charging final image of its lingering presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unsnarling promises before treaties signaled early, with accumulative deepening via breakthrough text narrowing options; cost felt in racing heart and risk of dreamer dismissal at peak presentation prep, coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony from buried promises emerges organically through latticework patterns and ceremonial text; final bridges image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though repeated phrasing slightly overtens subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with linguistic perceptual signature (patterns, harmonies); voice modulates poetically yet consistently, no dialogue or head-hopping; minor register elevation in abstract bursts like "symphonies of truth" fits but limits distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("interconnected promises," "unsnarl," "restore trust after silence" repeated across paragraphs) create template cadence, dulling propulsion in translation beats; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic archaeology as reconciliation tool via "symphonies of truth" transforms trope organically; risk in bold interpretations heightens stakes, but prompted repetition echoes reduce inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
