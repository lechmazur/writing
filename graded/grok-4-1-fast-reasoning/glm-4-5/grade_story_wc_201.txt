<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied trauma responses (sweat, tremors, glass breaths) root motivation in consistent traits; micro-choices like tracing strap patterns compel higher-stakes alignment. Minor diagnostic slips ("mercy isn't the absence") slightly abstract peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via trauma density buildup to CR closure; strap slipping as final image delivers legible conceptual cost in survival equation. Orientation anchors early; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>UV forest pulses actively (bark glowing, floor patterns), constraining decode choice and charging final strap activation. Sensory hierarchy (proprioceptive bias) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy math) signaled early, tightens via memory waves to strap alignment under Accum lens; agency in surrender/positioning forecloses pain-only path with felt tremor cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from strap decode reweighting pain-to-meaning; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Whisper line anchors without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with proprioceptive perceptual signature (precise pain mapping); rhythmic texture modulates stress without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action; minor "brace" and "ultraviolet" patterning taught early serves penance motif without loop drag. Coherent metaphors avoid muddle in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>UV forest + proprioception + math-encoded strap synthesize fresh trauma-lab premise; strap's algorithmic reveal transforms trope inevitably from prior cues.</comment>
