<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to collect wall stories is consistent and drives discoveries, but repetitive trait labels like "sensitively perceptive" and "odd historian" dilute interior specificity; realization of purpose in final smile feels earned yet lacks embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tapestry vibration to diary symbols linking dragons to axis shift; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in final image of preserved fragments with felt cost of severed mythic connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo library's curved walls and metal bones vividly constrain perception of embedded stories; "bronze quiet" recurs to mirror internal states and charge ending hum of lost dreams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving fading stories tightens accumulatively via deepening connections (tapestry to diaries), narrowing options against inevitable loss; agency low but endurance forecloses mythic reconnection with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories enduring post-dream loss emerges organically from particulars like dragon tapestry and wall whispers; final preservation image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in wall-sensing; poetic voice modulates rhythmically, though minor repetition edges toward uniformity under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops restate discoveries and motivation across paragraphs (e.g., repeated "probe" sequences and "bronze quiet" 7+ times); synonym churn and template phrasing ("The [trait] historian") dull propulsion, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo library where walls hold stories transforms tropes; dragon-axis premise feels inevitable via grounded particulars without hedging.</comment>
