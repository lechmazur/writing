<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli's embodied dread ("settled into Eli's bones like the damp chill") and contradictory impulses (trembling fingers amid confident decoding) compel the activation choice with visible cost; Dr. Aris applies relevant pressure via skepticism. Minor label-speak ("nervously confident") slightly abstracts interiority without peak harm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding journals → nail indentation → hidden panels chime → sequence initiation as DC closure with responsibility cost legible in "overwhelming responsibility" beat. Orientation anchored in first line; single scene fits defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Copper nail as micro-setting constrains pivotal choice (indentation press) and charges final image ("still warm against their skin"); damp chill, humming equipment, blue light filter through Eli's priorities. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis narrowing to panel response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate reversible tech) signaled early, tightens via Dr. Aris query and diagram reveal under causal lens, narrowing to activation trade-off with consensus-challenging cost. Agency in Eli's press forecloses skepticism path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reversible exile theme emerges organically from nail, journals, activation without statement; final image ("station began to respond") reconfigures personal/environmental exile with conceptual cost to consensus. Resonant via particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dread embodied sensorily); dialogue natural/subtextual (Dr. Aris skepticism advances doubt). Rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at "deep breath, Eli initiated."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops on "dread" (thrice) and "nervously confident" (twice) accumulate texturally without obscuring closure. No filter stacks or artifacts in peak activation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancestral sci-fi mystery (coded poems → jet stream reversal) transforms exile trope via nail/tech specificity; risk in poetic science feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
