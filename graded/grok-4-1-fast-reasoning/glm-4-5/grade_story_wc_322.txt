<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation via lost sister compels weaving and climactic touch, rooted in consistent architect traits; interiority concrete in finger manipulations and jolt recognition, but epiphany on connection leans told over embodied micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from shifting patterns to eruptions and infinite-tree CR closure; jolt of recognition delivers legible emotional cost; anchors Elias/gallery early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Optical illusions and breathing walls constrain approach to tapestry at climax, evolving to charge sister silhouette; sensory details (pulsing threads, bleeding colors) filter through architect's pattern bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to reach sister tightens texturally via autonomous thread/eruptions forcing touch agency; cost unmistakable in recognition jolt reweighting discovery as creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of created connection emerges implicitly from weaving/eruptions to final pulsing bond image, reweighting premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (shimmering sinew, twisting illusions); rhythmic modulation builds from calm weaving to awe-filled dream without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor loops in "memories altered" phrasing and "patterns" repetition dull propulsion slightly; strong density and varied rhythm elsewhere, but "Colors that had once were vibrant" grammatical slip jars.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sinew-thread dreams and rational enchantment synthesize fresh bridge to unconscious, transforming loss trope via specific eruptions and CR; risk in surreal escalation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
