<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation clear and consistent in duty-driven actions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; visitor's embodied hesitation ("step forward, then back") effectively pressures and reveals under stakes, earning relaxation at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through patterns to Charged Poise closure at final nod and star image ("secret still unspoken but somehow transformed"), with legible conceptual cost reweighting empathy over words; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dental mirror and shutters as micro-settings constrain weaving choices and charge final star image; cobalt dock after rain vividly selective, glistening slats mirroring internal tension, integrated purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unspoken secret vs. duty signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern density and visitor approach to eye-meet tightening; agency in guardian's continued weave forces visitor's stance shift with felt cost in momentary release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of light/shadow duality and silent empathy emerges organically from weaving actions; final spiral galaxy and star provide resonant non-literal answer, reweighting words vs. patterns without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature biased to light patterns; rhythmic prose modulates tension effectively, but minor distance wavers in poetic generalizations; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("half-spoken secret" x4, "patterns" churn across late beats) creates paraphrase loops and dulls propulsion into closure; overwriting with metaphors in every high-pressure line obscures density without taught pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-weaving guardian duty and unspoken secrets transforms silence tropes into visual poetry; risk-taking in accumulative patterns heightens stakes organically to inevitable empathetic reconfiguration.</comment>
