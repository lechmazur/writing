<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to trace origins rooted in logical traits drives discoveries; hypothesis shift shows credible endurance with self-readjustment cost. Minimal embodied contradiction or stress in peak realization limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (scrolls, maps, shadows) build density to CR closure in "bridge between past and present" with identity cost legible on-page. One tightening from blackout obstacle to revelation opportunity; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blackout lighting constrains methods and reveals stamp symbols in shadows, charging final image; underwater details (dappled light, textures) filtered through indexer POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace origins) accumulates pressure via matching sigil and confirmations, narrowing self-view; cost unmistakable in life's work readjustment under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Connection of personal origins to history emerges organically from stamp reprise and discoveries; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of detail-noticing suits logical indexer; diction/rhythm modulates serene discovery to charged resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("readjust" x4, "tranquilly perceptive" x2, "dappled resolve" x2) creates template cadence loops across reflective beats, dulling propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken library heritage via family stamp transforms discovery trope into personal CR; specific phoenix emblem and blackout shadows feel inevitable and fresh.</comment>
