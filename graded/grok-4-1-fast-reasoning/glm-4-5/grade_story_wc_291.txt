<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Face-blind trait integrates well via shape-focused perception and sketching under pressure, rooting motivation in artistic analysis. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during deduction; competence dominates without genuine struggle or embodied stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with ribbon→sketch→call→documents→custom mask realization tightening options effectively. Closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page via killer identification and mist-lift image with felt communal cost. Minor off-page confession mutes full decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded quarry and ribbon constrain choices via struggle patterns and light analysis, filtering through POV's textural bias. Sensory details selective and purposeful, with mist evolution charging closure image as empathy awakens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to solve "unsolvable" case signaled early, tightening via custom-mask link forcing narrowing to three suspects then one. Agency in methodical elimination drives escalation; cost legible in foreclosed anonymity but abstract at community scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of awakening dormant empathy emerges organically from overlooked details vs. forgotten faces. Final lines articulate thesis too directly ("Justice has been dormant... empathy never truly disappears"), triggering thematic echo penalty in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in shapes/textures; voice modulates poetically without head-hopping. Dialogue natural and goal-driven ("I need you to bring me..."); minor register elevation in interior fits artistic POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene intensity, density high in deduction beats. Repetitive "furrowed hush" and "methodical" phrasing creates minor paraphrase loops; figurative "lance through" purposeful but overwrites early setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's shape-based detection transforms cold-case trope into fresh synthesis. Quarry-masquerade anonymity ties organically to stakes without late rules; risk in poetic hush tone heightens isolation payoff.</comment>
