<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's analytic trait and death familiarity root motivation and compel the realization, shown through concrete actions like tracing letters; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak epiphany prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure via snow globe's on-page transformation—"now the plane was gone entirely"—reweighting premise with emotional cost of personal transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library's ocean pressure and snow globe as micro-setting constrain reflection and charge final image, with sensory details like "water droplets rolling down its surface like tears" mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of deciphering transmission tightens accumulatively through audio playback and letter-tracing to personal deepening; felt cost in "tears welling" and globe change charges ending under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "physics of letting go" emerges organically from transmission and globe particulars, with CR ending offering resonant reweighting of "home" as frequency shift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with analytic perceptual signature—"Her fingers traced the Japanese letters"—modulates rhythm to emotional peak; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; minor figurative density like "water droplets... like tears" purposeful but elevated diction in epiphany slightly risks coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh Earhart synthesis via medium-historian and frequency-shift metaphysics transforms tropes, with globe's evolution feeling inevitable and risky in hindsight.</comment>
