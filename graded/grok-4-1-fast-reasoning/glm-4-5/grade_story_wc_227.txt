<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied uncertainty in trembling palm and forehead against glass, with motivation to piece memories driving micro-choices like tracing pockmarks; interior conflict between foggy veil and clarity earned via statue interaction. Final reverence feels credible without unearned epiphany. Minor deduction for occasional diagnostic phrasing like "kintsugi intentions" slightly abstracting embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via pockmark matches to memories, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "uncertainty metamorphosed gradually into a kind of reverence"; cost legible in workshop tilt mirroring emotional turbulence. Orientation anchored early in floating workshop above acid sea. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like ticking astrolabe, cold etched-glass, and roiling acid sea filter through alchemist's priorities, constraining via precarious tilt during memory narration. Statue pockmarks as micro-setting charge choices and final image. Atmosphere of dire enchantment supports theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjuring meaning from oblivion signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening revelations at each pockmark cluster, forcing endurance with cost in physical tilt and foreclosed uncertainty. Agency in deliberate breath-holding and tracing narrows options to acceptance. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from statue-mending metaphor and memory-patching, reweighted in final "golden joining of fragments" without moralizing. Subtext in charm's pulse and workshop tilt layers emotional honesty. Resonant CR answers uncertainty's role non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in alchemical imagery (e.g., "reality softened like heated wax"); lyrical rhythm modulates from uncertainty to reverence. Voice distinct, textured syntax purposeful for accumulative build. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines integrating action, sensory, and interiority; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in revelation cadence. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "quilted memories... patching the frayed tapestry") risks coherence but stays voice-motivated. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory-quilting via pockmarked statue transforms isolation tropes; floating workshop's tilt ingeniously links metaphysics to physics. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
