<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness drives consistent micro-choices like daily experiments with the needle, embodied in tears and swaying; strength in character's transformation from isolation to teaching via vibrations. Minor label-speak in "persistent emotional numbness" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reverse-play experiments building to CR closure in final student demo; cost legible in reweighting deafness as gift ("filament of hush connected them all"). Orientation anchored early in cavern and seasons; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stone floor and vibrations constrain and charge choices, enabling felt music; seasons' "faint rustle" mirrors internal shift. Selective sensory focus on touch over sound fits POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates accumulatively from solo discovery to drum maker's involvement and student awe, narrowing from personal numbness to shared expression; agency in persistent trials forecloses isolation with transformation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of felt hush over heard music emerges organically from reverse-play images, reweighting disability in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via "symphony of silence" crystallized poised with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with vibration-biased perceptual signature ("vibrations flowed through her body"); rhythmic texture modulates from muted to charged, legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping; elision of sounds purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Verbatim repeats like "faint rustle of turning seasons" (twice) and "filament of hush" variants create paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in experimental beats; density otherwise high, rhythm varies. Minor overwriting in clichéd "symphony of silence" at close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise of backward records vibrating hush for deaf teacher transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic hush motif heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via needle's evolution to shared tool.</comment>
