<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's empirically intuitive trait drives concrete actions like tracing the chip and decoding ants, revealing flaws in deferred choices; final step-through earns change via prior causality, though interior impulses at doorways lean reflective over simultaneous contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from chip images to cavern symbols; on-page CR closure ("stepped through... possibilities realigned") legible with felt cost in solitude shift; orientation anchored early, one tightening at symbol projection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flowers, crystals, and rising creek constrain timing and project symbols, charging final emergence; selective sensory details (ants' pauses for berries) reflect map-dealer's perceptual bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doorway per promise) signaled early, tightens via timed cavern arrival and life-doorway revelation narrowing options; agency in following ants and stepping through drives escalation under accumulative lens, cost in foreclosed paths visible on walls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked crossroads emerges organically via symbols and ants, resonant CR in chip's post-return glimmer reweighting maps as "new ones of his own"; no moralizing, ambiguity in "solitude by choice" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with map-dealer's perceptual signature (patterns in ants, symbols); rhythmic prose modulates from shop dust to cavern pulse, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, rhythm without loops; purposeful repetition ("glimmer") propels under stress, minor overwriting in cavern descriptions ("blooming... stars") contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ants-as-guides and chip-projected life doorways synthesize fresh inflection on regret, transforming tropes via empirical intuition; risk in non-causal journey heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
