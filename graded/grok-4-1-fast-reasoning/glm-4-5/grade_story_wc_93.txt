<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Earned character arc peaks convincingly at "She finally understood what her mentor had tried to teach her," shifting curse from torment to guidance with felt cost of prior isolation. Interiority embodied in trembling fingers and visions, though some backstory summaries slightly dilute immediacy. Contradictory impulses between control and harmony act in the stone-placing ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stone placements build density to Resonant Reconfiguration closure, with star dust eruption reweighting stake via conceptual cost of risked destruction made legible in "even if it meant her own destruction." One tightening via pulsing intensification suffices; orientation anchors crisply by second paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless bluff's smooth stone constrains grip in opening ("bare feet gripping the smooth stone where friction had long since disappeared"), charging choices and final image of gathered stones. Sensory details selective (aurora's green on blue stone, eels' air patterns) mirror internal harmony without catalog. Environment evolves causally with events, filtering through POV's mathematical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harness patterns escalates accumulatively via star dust pulsing and eels aligning, narrowing options toward eruption with agency in stone sequences. Visible cost in "risk everything" and persistent curse charges final poise. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of respecting patterns over control emerges organically from ritual failure-to-success shift, resonating in non-literal realization "the patterns were not meant to be controlled, but respected." Final image reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of ongoing curse. Particulars like Fibonacci stones avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of cosmic visions and math harmony; lyrical texture modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences at eruption). No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased toward sequences and colors suits herder's idiom. Experimental poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive abstraction loops ("sacred patterns," "mathematical sequence[s]," "patterns" x6) create patterned artifact (−0.9), dulling density around climax without payoff. Vivid propulsion overall, but overwriting in color metaphors and stone-placement templates ("The [ordinal] stone...") triggers −0.5 paraphrase check. Closure image clear despite slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frictionless world with math-dancing eels and precognitive herder synthesizes fresh cosmic premise, transforming tropes via specific rule-set (no friction harmony/chaos). Bold risk in vignette ritual pays off inevitably at understanding; no derivative echoes, full conceptual commitment heightens stakes.</comment>
