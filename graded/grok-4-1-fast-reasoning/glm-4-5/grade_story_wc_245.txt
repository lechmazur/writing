<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via fingertips and ring sensations; motivation rooted in grief surfaces credibly through memories triggered by notes. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "navigate the uncharted emotional depths" borders therapy-speak but anchors present drive. Final transformation earned without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from vibrations to intensifying notes and silence at stillpoint. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via kneeling/press at center with tears as felt cost, reweighting blindness as strength.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy touch-dominant, selective (pressure points as braille); forest constrains path via ultrasonic hum guiding ring. Recurring tree/earth/ring charge final image. Final circle's subsidence mirrors internal calm, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach stillpoint for grief navigation) signaled early, escalates via note intensification and memory surfacing under accumulative lens. One tightening forecloses doubt at center. Agency in dowsing/following; cost in tears and foreclosed old path legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal charting emerges organically from touch/melody particulars, reweighted in final realization without statement. Closing image (melody etched like map) offers non-literal resonance to "greatest territory...universe within." No moralizing; ambiguity in blindness lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with touch-biased perceptual signature; lyrical compression taught early via vibrations/notes. Rhythmic modulation builds to silence. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits blind mapmaker's sensory lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops in "melody" repetitions (e.g., "hidden melody...sang of grief") and "quiet blaze" motif, but purposeful for tone without obscuring closure. No filter stacks or template cadence in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness-as-superpower with emotional cartography in ultrasonic world; transforms quest trope via touch languages and stillpoint CR. Risky lyric fantasy pays off in inevitable internal discovery. No derivative echoes.</comment>
