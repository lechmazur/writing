<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in embodied actions like scooping dust and examining the barrel, revealing contradictory impulses between fear and calling; final transformation from curse to purpose feels earned via prior observations. Minor slip: repeated "weightless burden" phrasing borders on label-speak, slightly undercutting specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building supernatural signs (dust, buzz, barrel) to Charged Poise closure in final paragraph, where ticking heartbeat reconfigures worlds with acceptance cost; orientation anchors immediately in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ceiling dust patterns and fluorescent buzz constrain choices and charge final image, with sensory details (popcorn smell, dust defying physics) filtered through Marcus's upward gaze; micro-setting of vial and barrel integrates flawlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering ceiling secrets) tightens accumulatively via device discovery and timed silence, forcing engagement with visible cost in reconfigured burden; one deepening suffices, escalating to undeniable pressure at ghost materialization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bridging worlds emerges organically from dust-to-ticking progression, with final whispers offering resonant non-literal answer to isolation without moralizing; recurring ceiling motif reweights premise subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in vertical observations (vibrations, dust swirls); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to charged in buzz-silence transition, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel momentum, but "weightless burden" loops (three instances) and minor paraphrase in dust descriptions create small scaffold drag; no closure touch, metaphors cohere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech's ceiling obsession with circus horology and dust as supernatural map transforms ghost tropes; risk in paradox-laden voice heightens stakes inevitably to ticking closure.</comment>
