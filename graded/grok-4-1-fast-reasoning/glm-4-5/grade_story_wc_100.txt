<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ties profession to lens pull, culminating in earned shift to keeper; stubborn trait constrains safe retreat amid warnings. Interiority concrete via vibration/distress feel upon touching shard. Minor flaw: "inadvertently stubborn" tells rather than fully dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain solid from package to lens coords to sub descent to restoration DC; closure reconfiguration as keeper forecloses surface life with felt cost in final image of eternal deep home. Orientation anchored early in study/package scene. Lens holds causal; one tightening at library discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through undertaker POV: coral forests, floating books in impossible spaces constrain docking/fixing choices and charge final beacon image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency in descent's "weight of ocean pressing in." Recurring lens as micro-setting reweights memory preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to answer lens pull tightens via warnings/currents to library confrontation; agency in arranging fragments forces trade-off of surface life. Cost legible in becoming keeper amid manifesting souls. Escalation causal under lens, one decisive narrowing sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation/rest emerges organically from undertaker motif and lens song transforming distress; final image of souls finding sanctuary reconfigures death-to-memory arc without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (souls/earth lens on library); voice texture modulates from haunted to welcoming via "chased stillness" to song. Rhythmic control heightens descent pressure. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere; rhythm varies with scene urgency, opening anchors stakes. Minor overwrite in "fish scattered like silver thoughts" and repeated "impossible spaces" risks muddle, but no loops touch closure. Propulsion clear to final light flood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker myth with underwater library beacon transforms tropes via lens souls; risk in impossible architecture heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
