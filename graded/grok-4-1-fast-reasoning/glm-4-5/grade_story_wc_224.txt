<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to understand home's shape consistently drives rituals and closure; interiority concrete in sensory overload and doubt, but revelation of talents lacks prior contradictory impulses acting in scene, feeling summarily told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from stone discovery to feather rituals culminating in on-page CR (mountain as nexus of stories) reweighting premise with conceptual cost of transformed doubt; orientation anchored early, one tightening via weekly shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore constrains searching and reshapes via rituals, charging final dissolution; feather and stone as micro-settings guide choices, sensory details (scent, vibrations) purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (home's shape) signaled early, textural escalation via ritual deepening forecloses doubt with felt cost in soul transformation; agency in feather-tracing narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of home as connections emerges organically from stone/feather transformations, final CR image ("tapestry woven with threads of belonging") resonantly reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with seer-specific perceptual bias toward textures/symbols; lyrical diction and rhythm modulate effectively with ritual intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and high density propel accumulatively; minor figurative muddle in revelation ("force of a blow," "seeds beneath snow") slightly dulls peak beat without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookstore-mountain as story nexus reshaped by feather texture transforms discovery tropes organically; risk in abstract mysticism heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
