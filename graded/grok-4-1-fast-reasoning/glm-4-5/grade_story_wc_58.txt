<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in tracing the thread and sensing the garden's scents reveal contradictory impulses toward avoidance and healing. Micro-choices like uncapping the pen and writing for Thomas compel the pivot to self-obituary with felt cost. Minor slip in slightly diagnostic phrasing around "geography of healing" but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single continuous scene with early orientation (traveler, shadowed garden, post-ship autumn). Meaningful tightening via density build from gardener's obit to self-writing as Charged Poise RR with legible cost in "something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal." No disorientation or lens ambiguity; closure image reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (earth/decay scents, dancing leaves, starlit thread) filtered through traveler's healing bias mirror internal states and constrain reflection. Garden as micro-setting charges final image, evolving with deepening shadows. Recurring thread anchors spatial coherence and charges closure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping healing via obits) signaled early; accumulative escalation deepens through textual density to self-obit, narrowing avoidance options with agency in penning own absence. Cost felt in confronting war ghosts and pre-war duty via thread. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absences as wounds/pathways emerges organically from thread, garden, and writing acts without statement; final self-obit image offers resonant CR reweighting premise (obits for living include self) with conceptual cost of wholeness. Subtext in projection's defensive irony layers complexity. No moralizing; ambiguity in healing lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (garden as heart-geography) and rhythmic modulation building to lyrical close. Prose texture purposeful in lyric mode, compression taught early via sensory immersion. No head-hopping or withholding; inference matches traveler's knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers traced the delicate weft thread" advances emotion/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops ("shadowed garden," "crimson weft") purposeful in pattern but slightly templated; no closure muddle or heavy artifacts. Varied syntax, strong verbs support ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise (obits for living) transformed via thread's evolution and projection method into inevitable self-healing arc; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious synthesis of absence/healing geography feels organic and memorable. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
