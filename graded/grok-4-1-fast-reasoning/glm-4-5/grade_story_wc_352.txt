<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait roots clear motivation and enables final puzzle solve, with embodied tension in "heart beating with the rhythm of a latent blaze." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; competence dominates without complicating flaws or micro-choices under peak time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain solid from manuscript to entry, puzzles, activation, and escape; closure DC lands on-page with time-cost legibility in "exactly seven minutes before gravity would right itself." Orientation anchored early; single tightening via personal combination sufficient. Minor redundancy in exit doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "taste of mist still on her lips" and glowing runes constrain choices and charge final image. Grotto mist and chamber water guide tactics purposefully. Spatial choreography coherent through serpentine curves; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate seeds) signaled early, tightens causally via puzzles narrowing to personal prism-mind input; time pressure forces agency with visible cost in hurried escape. Escalation coheres under causal lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cycle of vigilance emerges organically from activation and future implication, resonant in final "eternal cycle" image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in hidden knowledge vs. oblivious world avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias via prism-sight; voice texture poetic and consistent in fantasy idiom. No dialogue to judge; minor register elevation fits archivist but lacks peak-stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn in final third ("reenter the serpentine grotto," "forgotten combinations," "latent blaze") dull closure image and drag momentum; template cadence in repeated reflective summaries. Density functional but scaffold obvious; rhythm varies minimally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gravity inversion and prism-doodle offer fresh inflections on portal fantasy, transformed via puzzle logic. Tropes like ancient guardians feel templated without bold risk; synthesis organic but not inevitable.</comment>
