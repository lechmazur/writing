<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in dream-haunted quest compels micro-choices like raising the watch and documenting under deadline, with embodied emotions (trembled hands, pressed letter). Lacks sharper contradictory impulses or flaws driving scene mistakes; veiled dreamer reads archetypal rather than deeply particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from watch cycles and cipher clues to library materialization and urgent transcription, with Accumulative/Textural lens building revelation density to Conceptual Repricing closure (seeker transformed, library fades with intuited second letter cost). Orientation anchored early; single tightening via vibrating watch holds scope defaults. Minor vagueness in propagation mechanics doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist-clung forest and organic mist-walls vividly constrain entry (fog density required, watch pulses to part), sensory details (luminescence, fluttering pages) integrated into action mirror internal revelations. Recurring mist charges final image (clings to cloak); POV-biased perceptual hierarchy fits dreamer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find library) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening revelations and watch vibration narrowing time options, with agency in approach/touch/document foreclosing receding access. Cost legible in hurried transcription and fading library; one tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words' power emerges organically from library experiences (flooded near-spoken memories, preserved emotions), final journal/ laughter image reweights silence's value without moralizing. Complexity lingers in transformation's oblique cost; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (reverse words via cracked crystal, rippling world) and rhythmic modulation (expanding time inside library). Voice texture distinct in syntax/word choice; whispers carry subtext; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels through revelation beats; sensory images purposeful. Minor overwriting in climax metaphors (diaphanous/spectral/ethereal density without payoff) and occasional paraphrase ("unspoken" echoes) dull peak slightly, but no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cipher-watch/library premise transforms quest trope via specific mechanics (reverse cycles, propagation ripples) into conceptual payoff on silence's power. Risky lyrical fantasy coheres without gimmick; irreplaceable details like tea-leaf patterns ground ingenuity.</comment>
