<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses via paradoxes act in scene ("Courage is found through surrender"), earning final unbosoming; future-self reveal deepens motivation with cost. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies like "transform the relationship."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with paradox density building to CR closure ("fear's weakness... clings to the illusion") reweighting death/curse; legible cost in lost illusion, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and luminance constrain cursed perceptions from entry, mirroring internal fear; charges final image as structure crumbles and light enters veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant fear-confront stake signaled early tightens via accumulating paradoxes and mirror reveal, narrowing to agency in touching clasp; cost felt in foreclosed running from death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Paradoxes emerge theme of fear-as-illusion organically; final image ("curse... gift") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without direct moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person surreal perceptual signature ("sickly, beautiful light") with rhythmic modulation under pressure; sparse advisor dialogue advances subtextually.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density overall, but minor loops in "whispering advisor" (repeated 4x) and luminance phrasing dull some beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photographic curse, self-advisor, and paradox mechanics transforms funhouse trope; future-self reveal feels inevitable from mirror beat.</comment>
