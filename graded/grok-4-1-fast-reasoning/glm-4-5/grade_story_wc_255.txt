<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in bartering for Gideon's awakening via patterns, with colorblindness embodied in selective shades; innocent cunning shown through dire pattern consequences. Final unexpected vision return earns change with cost of prior "trivial" view. Minor slip: internal conflict more persistent than contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of petal arrangement builds to courtyard "inhale" and shimmer, tightening to CR closure in Elara's unnoticed vision flood and mutual recognition of imperfection's beauty. Orientation anchored early in courtyard. Cost legible: "finding beauty... in the subtle variations of gray and shadow that had once been her entire world."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glassblower's courtyard vividly filters through Elara's bias, with Fibonacci plants and prismatic ornaments constraining via glassblowers' pauses and charging final shimmer. Sensory selection purposeful: tones others miss guide arrangements. Recurring phoenix fire in reed sliver recharges image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bartered awakening via perfect arrangement) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern completion to shimmer and exchange, narrowing to Charged Poise. Agency in persistent placing forecloses interruption risk with felt cost in Gideon's stiffened hands. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of awakenings through arrangement emerges implicitly from petal Fibonacci to courtyard inhale and dual realizations, reweighting imperfection without moralizing. Final image resonates: beauty in "gray and shadow" alongside vibrant return. No thematic echo or platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Elara with perceptual signature in shade variations and pattern dialect; rhythmic prose modulates to lyrical shimmer at peak. No dialogue to judge; elision of color loss backstory anchors to present cues. Voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in petal placements; minor paraphrase loops in "beauty in imperfection" phrasing (-0.4). No filter stacks or template cadence; figurative "air shimmering" coherent and propulsive. Closure image clear without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-phoenix barters, plant-language cunning, and reed-for-dexterity trade transforms rebirth trope via specific Fibonacci dialect. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable to CR; no derivative echoes.</comment>
