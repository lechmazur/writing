<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses; the sentimentalist drifts passively without micro-choices under pressure or embodied flaws complicating its mission. Motivation stated repetitively but lacks character-particular stakes or visible cost to its eternal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density building to Charged Poise closure in final reflection on "troubling serenity," reconfiguring eternal purpose with conceptual cost of yearning. Orientation anchored early in nebula garden; one tightening via transit delivery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden and gear vividly constrain transit and charge final image of gear resuming spin amid swirling colors. Sensory details (sonar ripples, petal sighs) selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle enlightenment) signaled early with accumulative escalation via motif intensification during transit; agency in sending waves forecloses destructive alternative with felt cost in civilizations' past recoils. Lacks deeper reversal narrowing options beyond pattern density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of non-consuming illumination emerges organically from gear's recordings and light-sharing, culminating in resonant final image reweighting cycles without moralizing. Complexity in "some recoiled" avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward cosmic patterns; rhythmic texture modulates from drifting to focused intensity. Motif repetition taught early as pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" (repeated 8+ times) and "calculating machine gear" create template cadence, dulling propulsion in transit beats. Figurative density overwrites without consistent payoff, obscuring peak momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentimental cosmic guardian with gear-as-archivist transforms SF tropes via poetic fractals and non-fire light; risk in heavy motif recurrence heightens lyric stakes without gimmick.</comment>
