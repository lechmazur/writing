<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to prove listening heals emerges but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; internal conflict is summarized rather than shown in pivotal dawn gatherings. Community residents feel stereotypical as lore-dumpers without distinct status dynamics or pressure on Leo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of neighborhood stories tightening to key reveal and CR closure via letters' discovery, reweighting locket's value with community cost against demolition. Orientation anchors early in shop/locket; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Courtyard at dawn vividly anchors repeated shards with gold light, coffee, flowers constraining Leo's listening choices; recurring motif charges final reconnection image. Sandstorm calm tensions intrusion effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of solving locket to heal community deepens accumulatively via stories, narrowing to mailbox with felt cost in demolition threat; agency via persistent listening endurance forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening/memory healing emerges organically from particulars like letters to neighbors, resonant CR in display reweighting intrusion vs. sanctuary without moralizing; final courtyard image answers question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward objects/stories; dialogue natural/subtextual in courtyard snippets, distinct by age (Mrs. Henderson's whisper). Rhythmic modulation supports accumulative calm under intrusion pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("neighborhood storytelling," "outside world intrudes," "vibrant courtyard at dawn") across beats dull density; paraphrase in closure summary ("healing began") drags momentum. Some template cadence in dawn transitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Locket mystery trope familiar, mildly transformed via community letters but lacks non-obvious synthesis; safe middle-ground avoids bold risks in structure or premise.</comment>
