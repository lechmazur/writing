<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots consistently in anonymous giving and intergenerational ties, compelling the declaration with felt scarcity cost; interiority concrete via smiles and nods under pressure. Mild contradictory impulses in anonymity vs. public declaration earned by Mira's news. Secondary characters like Tomas apply relevant pressure via grandmother's question.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: food runs and bell pattern build density to Charged Poise closure in declaration, reconfiguring resilience with sanctions cost legible in "scarcer in the coming months." Orientation anchors early under arbor; one tightening via Mira's checkpoint news narrows options coherently. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and ridge constrain isolation/sanctuary, charging final bell image; "amplified quiet" sensory detail reflects POV urgency and mirrors internal resolve. Bell as recurring object evolves tactilely across beats. Spatial choreography clear from arbor to square.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain exiles vs. sanctions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's "tightened restrictions" and northern news, forcing declaration agency with scarcity trade-off cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience-through-tradition theme emerges organically from bell/food runs motif shifting to expanded mission; final declaration offers non-literal answer via collective "architects" image. Minor friction in articulated "resistance" line borders thematic echo without replacing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward traditions (bell history filtered via Elias); dialogue natural/subtextual (Tomas probes anonymity goal). Rhythmic control modulates from quiet persistence to dawn strength; diction fits leader's gentle idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bell repetition purposeful as motif without obscuring propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on scarcity/sanctions (−0.4). High density in action-integrated details; rhythm varies naturally, read-aloud clean. No filter stacks or template cadence in peak declaration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile tropes via anonymous food runs and bell as resistance bridge; declaration turn inevitable from established persistence without late rules. Bold public expansion risks scarcity cost organically.</comment>
