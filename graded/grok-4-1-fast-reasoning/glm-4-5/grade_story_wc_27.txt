<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete at moments like toes curling around debris and vibration in bones, but final epiphany ("she understood that she was the meaning") reads as unearned label-speak without prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices sparse, with passive wandering until late step into circle. Lacks embodied conflict or visible cost to transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to stone discovery, hum intensification, and Charged Poise closure in light enveloping her with felt spiritual cost ("ready to reignite... revolution of the spirit"). Orientation anchored early in spaceport amid rebellion lull. One tightening via stones suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stones constrain choice (approach, step in) and charge final image (light emanates); bare feet ground tactile navigation amid debris/drones. Sensory hierarchy sharpens via POV (cosmic hum over creaks). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift from ruin to calm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning amid chaos) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum escalation forcing stance crystallization in circle. Agency in stepping in/raising arms forecloses despair with transformation cost felt on-page. Pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of spirit amid tech ruin emerges organically via stones/glasses reprise shifting from distant stars to inner light. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: borderline pseudo-profundity in "she was the meaning" dilutes ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature (stars familiar, hum in bones). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, peaking in charged final image. Voice particular without register drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in rebellion descriptors ("broken ships and broken dreams," "mess of broken ships") and repetitive "seemed" constructions create minor churn, dulling peak density. Rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors ("thunderous serenity") risks coherence in hum build. Propulsion holds to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi spaceport ruin with ancient stones/ barefoot mystic activates trope of cosmic quest. Risky barefoot navigation and opera glasses reprise feel inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of rebellion lull into spiritual revolution heightens stakes organically.</comment>
