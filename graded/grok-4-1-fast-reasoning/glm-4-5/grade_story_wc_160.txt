<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to harmonize values intensifies through discoveries, with embodied trembling showing contradictory anxiety/excitement; micro-choices like adhesive analysis reveal machinist traits under pressure. Interior conflict emerges in tremulous hands shifting to certainty, earned by scene causality. Minor stock epiphanies ("encrypted compassion" whisper) slightly dilute particularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: adhesive analysis → inscription discovery → design sketch tightens knowledge toward Charged Poise closure (sketches folded, chain as talisman). Orientation anchored early (Elara pacing amphitheater floor). One meaningful deepening via inscription reconfigures options with felt emotional cost in final certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: light through cracks, moss-covered stone, building's breath constrain water path tracings and charge sketches. POV machinist bias filters details (angles, channels) purposefully. Recurring volcano rhythm mirrors internal resolve, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flood vs. preserve) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discoveries narrowing to harmonious design; agency in adhesive analysis and inscription tracing forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in anxiety-to-certainty shift (trembling hands steady). Single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony emerges organically from adhesive/inscription particulars and final sketch/envelope image reweighting progress/preservation tension. Encrypted compassion motif shifts from past hero to Elara's legacy without statement. Resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with machinist perceptual signature (water flow patterns, adhesive composition). Prose texture poetic yet consistent, modulating rhythm with intensity; purposeful repetition (breathing) taught early. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs slightly dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("tremble" x4, "antique surveyor's chain" returns, "breathing"/"dappled resolve") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence in discovery beats, dulling density. Rhythm varies but scaffold in redundant harmony assertions slows propulsion. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: machinist decoding ancient adhesive/inscription in breathing volcano amphitheater transforms preservation trope via specific water channels. Risky poetic tone heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Core premise feels organic, not templated.</comment>
