<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ethical reversal post-argument compels performance choice with endurance cost, but half-lit epiphanies read as unearned stock phrasing without contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density (epiphanies, serenity) building to CR closure in final dome reflection where interconnected narratives reconfigure with conceptual cost of silenced voices; shards transition legibly, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dome as sanctuary and stick constrain reflective solitude, charging final image; sensory details (indigo twilight, filtered light) selective and POV-biased toward meditative craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ethical reversal deepens accumulatively via performance success narrowing stereotypes, with felt cost of critics/notoriety in closing reflection; one cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative power emerges organically from puppet dignity vs. media stereotypes, resonant CR in final epiphany reweighting interconnected stories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature (urbane ink strokes, pulsing puppets) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation fits serene tone; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("uncommonly serene" x3, "half-lit epiphany" x3, "meteor hush" x2) and paraphrase churn (serenity contrasts) dull propulsion across reflection beats; template cadence in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer reversing homelessness narratives in dome sanctuary transforms tropes organically; risk in subversive bar shows heightens stakes.</comment>
