<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deepest motivation shifts convincingly from curiosity to compassion through the child's echo revelation, earning the final transformation of melancholy; contradictory duty vs. curiosity impulses act in the kneeling/singing beat. Richly perceptive trait enables star-path discernment and disturbance sensing, grounding interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via refrain motifs tightening to RR closure: child's decision and singer's lifted melancholy reconfigure balance with conceptual cost of newfound understanding. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one meaningful deepening via seashell's child-reveal narrows options to soothe-or-disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight constrains paths and charges final held-breath image; canyon walls amplify song, flat stone enables seashell placement as micro-setting tool. Sensory selection (silent dust steps, star shifts) reflects perceptive urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nexus balance vs. unraveling echo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via converging intrigue/forces to singer's agency in song-offering choice, foreclosing endless echo path with felt emotional cost in melancholy repricing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as unreadiness emerges organically from particulars (child's growing spirit, unraveling webs), resonant final light/acceptance reweights premise without moral; lingering ambiguity on future echoes invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (star-pattern discernment, reverberation listening) stable in single POV; rhythmic refrains modulate purposefully with pressure, teaching pattern early for closure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful refrain accumulation varies rhythm; minor motif paraphrase loops serve accumulative texture without obscuring cause/effect, propelling to charged final smile image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-spirits, seashell whispers, and progressive-song disclosure transforms ghost/redemption tropes; risk-taking lyric refrains heighten closure resonance inevitably from singer's perceptual world.</comment>
