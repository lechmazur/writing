<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coachman's interiority shines in embodied attunement to fog, water timbre, and historical traces, rooting motivation in ritual duty; final knot ties earned endurance with felt thumb-prick cost, no stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from gutters' ticking to slowing silence, culminating in CR closure—"tied off the final knot"—repricing thresholds with ongoing vigil cost; orientation anchors early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (silent hooves, percolating droplets, mist-absorbing knots) filters via POV's attentive bias, constraining ritual wait; yarn needle as micro-setting charges final image without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor palimpsest promise via stitching—tightens accumulatively as gutters slow and thumb pricks, narrowing to Charged Poise endurance; cost legible in perpetual duty, no abstract gaps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden wisdom in thresholds emerges via layered promises and ritual, resonating in final "somewhere in between" realization without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in superstition's truth, reweighting particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spindrift patterns, ambient rhythms) stable in single close-POV; syntax modulates serene intensity to charged closure, purposeful elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "percolating"/"ticking" and figural density in ritual beats dull propulsion slightly; closure image clear, no scaffold obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal coachman ritual transforms superstition trope via yarn knots absorbing mist; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens threshold stakes organically.</comment>
