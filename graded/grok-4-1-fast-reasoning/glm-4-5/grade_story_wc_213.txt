<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to listen over noise drives all choices, embodied in rope-testing and switch-making; final smile earns validation after years of eccentric pursuit. Minor label ("credulously curious" twice) borders stock phrasing without deeper contradiction in peak wait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build to CR closure in bell's ring and hush, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of validated subtlety over tech. Orientation anchors early; switch tightens to rope-pull payoff without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sanctuary, peaks, and bell constrain choices (repairs, listening) and charge final hush image; sensory wind, creaks filter via Elias's attuned POV, evolving with clouds' glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bell detects storm first) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pressure drops, clouds, rope-tighten; agency in switch forecloses digital path with felt validation cost in smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of subtle listening emerges organically via observations culminating in mountain's "talk"; final hush-image reweights noise-overload premise without statement, inviting ambiguity on old ways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, perceptual signature in micro-variations and hums; rhythm modulates from setup to charged hush without drift, elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory action; minor paraphrase loops on listening/method (−0.4), but no closure touch; read-aloud flows purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bell-as-storm-sensor premise fresh, synthesized via microclimate art and solstice test; risk in mechanical sensor pays off in ring, transforming eccentric trope into inevitable CR.</comment>
