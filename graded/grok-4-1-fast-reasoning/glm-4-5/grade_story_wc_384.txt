<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to redeem treason drives arc to blood-sealed addendum, with guilt embodied in steady hands tracing signatures; internal conflict solid but leans summary ("motivation had evolved") over simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to Causal DC/CR closure via key-revealed forgery and signed addendum, with legible cost in lifted weight and faced "unfinished"; single scene anchors early, one tightening via compartment reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary constrains isolation-to-exit arc, aurora's shifting glow mirrors internal thaw and charges final image; dripping stalactites rhythmically underscore endurance without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early tightens via key-enabled forgery confrontation, protagonist agency in thorn-pricked confession forecloses betrayal with symbolic/emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Treason-as-wisdom theme emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in final CR ("calibrated treason... foundation for unexpected wisdom"); thorn shifts pain-to-renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with forger-specific perceptual signature (elegant curves, ink vibrancy); rhythmic prose modulates reflective build to charged exit, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but "stalactites dripped" loops (4x) create minor template cadence dulling momentum; no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery guilt with magical key-unmaking transforms redemption trope; thorn-key integration risks poignant CR on hearts/keys.</comment>
