<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but dramatized via summary over embodied micro-choices; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making purpose realization feel declarative rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup from capsule study to timeless suspension; CR closure lands on-page with legible conceptual cost in "weight of her responsibility" and fragment's warmth acknowledging her shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald silo and capsule details constrain discoveries and charge final image; pulsing walls and leaking moments filter through POV urgency without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Textural escalation via message decoding deepens stake to time-as-tapestry; protagonist agency in cross-referencing forecloses linear-time view with responsibility cost felt in embedding her own messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Time-weaving theme emerges organically from garage-sale decodings like "light guides through darkness"; final fragment-in-palm reconfigures premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with temporal perceptual signature ("texture of time passing"); rhythmic prose modulates effectively during suspension without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel accumulatively, but repetitive "emerald silo" (5+ uses) and synonym churn on "understanding" create minor loops dulling peak revelation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garage-sale messages in time capsule synthesize post-Reckoning ingenuity freshly; transforms temporal tropes through mundane embeddings without derivative echoes.</comment>
