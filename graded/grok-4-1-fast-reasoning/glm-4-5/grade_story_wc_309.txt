<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel unstrapping as micro-choice revealing values; interiority concrete in tracing wall and shedding pack. Internal conflict mild, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany images flooding mind borders on stock summary without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from spire stare to folly, pattern break at unstrapping, CR closure in keystone lift reweighting standardized magic with conceptual cost of diverging path. Cost legible in "oppressive weight... final clasp released"; one tightening via mist walking suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective, icebound spire and cloud layers constrain via pack interference and mist accommodation; garden folly charges final bloom image. Sensory hierarchy mage-specific, mirroring internal shift from automated to raw wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim wonder tightens accumulatively at unstrapping, narrowing to raw presence with agency and felt cost of shedding regulation. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening changes knowledge of magic's source.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence over programming emerges organically via journey particulars, resonant in folly bloom and keystone glow reprise. Final para "luminous light often comes from within" direct moralizing echoes thesis, flattening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in paradox-noticing ("brilliant dimness"); diction/rhythm modulate from chill observation to warm expansion. Voice distinct, mage-biased selectivity in automated vs raw details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion aligns with beats; rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "crystalline air formations that defied gravity" and stacked modifiers slightly blur climax unstrapping without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic era vs raw wonder transforms tropes via specific luminance and mist walking. Risk in poetic fantasy prose heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
