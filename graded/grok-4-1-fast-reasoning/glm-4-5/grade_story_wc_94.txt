<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "furiously tranquil expression" hiding revolutionary fire, embodied in trembling fingers tracing scars; motivation to map scars drives micro-choices like arranging notebook/envelope. Final endurance of nightly vigil feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip: some epiphanic abstraction like "power of truth, like lightning" borders on unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent/setup to timer beeps/writing/climax image. Orientation anchored early ("spiral staircase of the stormlit observatory"). Charged Poise closure in final deck moment reconfigures censorship premise with felt isolation cost ("descend back below the clouds"). One tightening via timer marking "masks slip" narrows to writing beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds vividly constrains isolation/rebellion, sensory hierarchy via lightning/ thunder biasing to electric "verses"; charges final image ("clouds had parted... star-sprinkled sky"). POV-filtered details like battered dome mirror suppression. Spatial choreography coherent from stairs to deck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poetic rebellion vs. censorship) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timer/storm/writing with agency in tracing scars/extracting map. Tightening forecloses inaction as she writes "furiously"; cost legible in isolation ("no one could hear you scream"). No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient expression emerges organically from scars/map/stars imagery, reweighted in final "words—like rarefied air—would somehow seep through." Subtext in whispers/tracing avoids statement; resonant non-literal answer in cartography illuminating truth. No moralizing; ambiguity in regime's endurance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("storm's electric language"); diction/rhythm modulates from tranquil setup to furious writing peak. No head-hopping; compression purposeful/legible under accumulative lens. Voice particular: storm-infused syntax reflects poet's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor artifacts: paraphrase loops in timer "beeped softly... beeped again" and repetitive thunder/storm motifs dull peak writing beat (−0.6). Rhythms vary read-aloud; no filter stacks. Metaphors coherent ("lightning struck... bathing... in storm-kissed wonder").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: censorship as "cartography of scars" via bus timetable/map transforms trope organically. Bold lyric risk in observatory vigil heightens stakes; final image inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; particular details like marginalia hash-marks personalize.</comment>
