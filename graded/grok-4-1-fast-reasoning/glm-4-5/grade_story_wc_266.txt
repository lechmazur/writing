<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maris's traits root motivation consistently, culminating in earned realization "This is where unused courage waits"; embodied through clutched punch heating. Collective POV blurs individual contradictions, but micro-choices like stamping air compel change with felt burden of dragons.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist/journey density builds to CR: dragon reveal reconfigures ferry role, cost legible in "coiled around their necks like living star-stamps of potential." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and cavern constrain traversal choices, charging final return image; waterfall embrace mirrors internal surrender. Sensory selection (waves licking stone, liquid twilight) purposeful, POV-biased toward mystical vigilance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via punch pull to cavern entry narrowing options. Agency in indirect routes and final stamp forces stance crystallization; cost in invisible dragons alters future vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: quiet dragons answer "where unused courage waits," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from journey motifs avoids platitudes, invites ambiguity on courage's call.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with misty perceptual signature modulates rhythmically; whispers natural, subtext-laden ("We should begin now"). Stable collective POV, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in cavern, flowing traversal); high density purposeful without muddle. Minor motif repetition ("shoreline lullaby") taught early, charges closure without loops obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: ferry guides questing dragons-as-courage transforms myth with fresh conceptual risk. Final reconfiguration inevitable from leash-break setup, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
