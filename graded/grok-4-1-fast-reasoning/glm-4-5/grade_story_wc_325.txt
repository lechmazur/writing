<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia creates contradictory impulses acting in scene ("squared her shoulders against the stone doorway," "walls seemed to press closer") that resolve into earned endurance as purpose overrides fear at climax. Motivation rooted in brother's loss intensifies choices with felt social cost (lost friends/career). Interiority concrete and embodied without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers/shadows builds to Charged Poise closure ("codex closed with a sigh as the last shadow departed") reconfiguring her stance, with legible cost in timed emergence ("just as the tide began to creep up"). Orientation anchored early; single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Facility and tide concretely constrain choices (42-to-30-minute window narrows tactics); sensory details (damp air, hum to hush) filter through her perceptual bias, charging final waves-vs-silence image. No white-room; spatial coherence strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide unremembered in tidal window) signaled early; textural escalation via gathering shadows and intensified glow forces endurance, with visible cost in timed pressure ("Thirty minutes remained"). Agency in guiding seven crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of passage for unremembered emerges organically from particulars (shadows flowing to hand, travel via cables); final image ("waves crashed... sacred silence between") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting belonging-without-belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (sensing electromagnetic whispers); rhythmic modulation (short urgent sentences in hush) fits tone. No dialogue; purposeful poetic diction consistent without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (read-aloud strong). Minor repetition ("phase transitions") purposeful for textural lens but borders loop; no major artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cables-as-psychic-veins and gold-fleck codex transforms ghost story into inevitable phase-transition logic; risk in supernatural facility risks paid off without gimmick.</comment>
