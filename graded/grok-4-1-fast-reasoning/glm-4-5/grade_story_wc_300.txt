<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in "warmth spread through her hands like liquid sunlight," earning the transformative motivation; hesitation motif hints at contradiction without full simultaneous impulses acting on-page, minor slip away from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to Charged Poise closure in crown's "weight, a constant reminder"; cost felt in foreclosed inspector role, on-page in final mission crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves' "pulsed with an ethereal blue light" and "resonant hush" recur to constrain pearl approach and charge final hush as companion; sensory hierarchy fits inspector's priorities, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inspection tightens accumulatively to pearl-lift reversal, narrowing from endings to beginnings; agency in crowning forces trade-off with felt emotional cost legible in crown's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of disconnection-as-doomsday emerges implicitly via hopes absorbed and walls dissolved; final image of perceiving shadows on people offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting bunkers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light/hush bias; rhythmic modulation under transformation serves Accumulative lens, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density propels but minor paraphrase loops in "abandoned hopes" and "resonant hush" repeats dull two mid-beats; closure image clean, rhythm varies purposefully overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pearl-to-crown synthesis transforms bunker trope into heart-healing premise organically; risk in crystal/seashell specificity feels inevitable, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
