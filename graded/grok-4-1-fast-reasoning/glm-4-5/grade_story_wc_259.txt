<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in pursuing forbidden knowledge against instincts, with embodied persistence via random paths; internal conflict emerges in trained categorization vs. patternless method. Repetitive "anguished joy" labels slightly diagnostic, flattening contradictory impulses in peak merger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atom density builds to visions and merger; orientation anchored early in archive/pagoda. Closure as CR in "forever changed by the forbidden knowledge," with legible conceptual cost of self-merger in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: cool bronze pulse, twilight shifts on pagoda constrain random paths and charge visions. Pagoda as micro-setting guides choices, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent in single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purification signaled early, tightens accumulatively via atom response to patternless action, foreclosing trained approach. Agency in persisting amid unpredictability culminates in merger cost, visibly paid in transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge recovery at personal cost emerges organically from visions to merger, reweighting "end of innocence" in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in her becoming vessel, embracing ambiguity of loss as understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in biased noticing of nostalgic particles; rhythmic texture modulates with immersion depth. Purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density in action integration, but paraphrase loops on "anguished joy" and "end of innocence" (3+ echoes) create mild scaffold, dulling peak immersion; minor template cadence in emotional stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia atoms and pattern-avoidance transforms lost-civ trope into tactile mysticism; random-path mechanic risks bold ingenuity, heightening stakes organically to charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
