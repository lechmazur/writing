<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, shown through deliberate prism adjustments after the whistle; actions align with intuitive monitoring. Weakness: lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices—no micro-turns under pressure, all smooth success. Passengers' reactions reveal his impact but no relational crucible since no direct interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whistle hush to passenger relaxations culminating in Charged Poise RR at "ready once again to witness and shape the profound quiet." Orientation anchored early via Elias on prism terrace; one tightening via catalyzing post-whistle. Cost legible in "all peace is temporary" line charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace and storm glass vial constrain choices (angling facets, clear crystals signal conditions) and charge final image (vial predicts fair skies). Sensory selection vivid and POV-biased toward silence/sound; valley colors, rainbows evolve with actions. Micro-setting (vial in palm) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalyze comforting silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via passenger responses post-whistle tightening. Agency in adjustments forces micro-deepening; cost felt in temporary peace ("dark clouds gathering"). No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of intentional silence as healing emerges organically from prism adjustments and reactions, resonant in final "vaulting hush that could...comfort even the most troubled heart." No moralizing; ambiguity in unnoticed transformation invites reflection. Passenger particulars (crying woman, anxious man) ground subtext without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (noise/silence intuition, glass communication). Voice texture distinct in hush-focused diction/rhythm, modulates from setup to satisfied poise. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density, rhythm varies with hush-building cadence; vivid images like "crystals...tiny fortunetellers." Minor loops in "drifting prism terrace"/"storm glass vial" repeats and passenger paraphrase lists dull slightly (−0.4). No heavy artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prisms-as-sonic-healers transforms transit trope into transformative hush; risk in abstract silence-shaping feels organic via vial/prisms. Final reconfiguration (temporary peace memory) inevitable from Elias's logic. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual angle elevates.</comment>
