<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rational traits drive precise ritual and foraging actions, with embodied contradiction in tears/release at naming self, earning shift to connection. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("social suicide") borders therapy abstraction but doesn't flatten peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density building to CR closure in second eye discovery, reweighting relics' purpose with felt cost (solitude's toll via cracked voice/tears). Orientation anchored early ("storm-battered ravine"); no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm/orchard constrain ritual (masks workings, gale tests steadiness) and charge final image (sunlight on "broken and beautiful" trees mirroring fractured grace). Fork unearths closure prop; sensory hierarchy fits forager bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual deepening (warmth/fractals to stillness), forcing renunciation of pure occlusion with legible cost (tears/exhaustion). Agency in naming forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intentional empathy emerges organically via relic ritual to second-eye realization, resonant non-literal answer in pocketing both "for others" reweighting liability-to-gift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with forager-perceptual signature (methodical scans, precise relic cues); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual intensity. No dialogue; elision of others' emotions purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection; rhythm varies with storm/ritual. Minor artifact in "discredited textbooks" paraphrase loop (three mentions) dulls mid-density without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-virus empathy world with relic ritual transforms isolation trope; second-eye discovery feels inevitable from hinted textbook patterns, risking conceptual depth without gimmick.</comment>
