<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in grandfather's inheritance, with embodied serene upheaval driving the shift from myth-chasing to truth-training; final renunciation of false legends earned via journal discovery. Subtle internal conflict in self-doubt ("often wondered if she was truly equipped") acts simultaneously with action. No safety-hedging; flaws in past pursuits complicate new mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discovery density (sundial pull, journal find, code reading) tightens to CR closure; cost legible in "turbulent in its implications" reconfiguring her worldview. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early at canal edge. No orientation debt; persistent sundial constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting handled tactilely ("warm from her touch," "tracing patterns") constrains discovery choice and charges final metaphor image. Sensory hierarchy selective (lapping water, dust motes, groaning wood) mirrors internal calm amid upheaval; barge evolution from approach to cabin integrates purposefully. Atmosphere tensions tone without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth fragments) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal alignment narrowing to mission reconfiguration; agency in boarding/salvaging forecloses myth-chasing path. One tightening at code deciphering changes knowledge/options with felt cost in "serene upheaval." Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges organically from journal contradictions and sundial metaphor, reweighting perspective without statement; final image answers "truth and falsehood depended on where one stood" resonantly. Subtext in repeated instincts shifting meaning avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in implications for society.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("subtle vibrations of authenticity," biased legend-honed noticing); rhythmic prose modulates from calm description to charged realization. Voice texture particular (lyric reflections like "dark ribbon") sustains under low external pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but minor paraphrase loops ("errant legend seeker" thrice, "architecture of lies" recurrence) and synonym churn on truth/deception dull mid-reflection momentum (−0.6). Rhythm varies read-aloud; no filter stacks or template cadence in peak realization. Strategic telling compresses backstory effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-seeking via sundial metaphor transforms trope of artifact quest; risk in serene reflective tone heightens conceptual stakes (+0.3). Non-obvious hinge at journal code aligning "thoughtfully clear precision" feels inevitable. No derivative templates; voice commits to bold hindsight frame.</comment>
