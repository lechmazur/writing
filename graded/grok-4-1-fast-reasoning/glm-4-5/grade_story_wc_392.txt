<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory calm exterior versus turmoil driving micro-choices like examining scratches; final shift to courage earned via discoveries. Minor flaw: occasional label-speak like "fortified vulnerability" abstracts peak emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with deepening discoveries (lantern scratches to note) tightening stakes to closure's Charged Poise; cost legible in "actions that might jeopardize her career." Orientation anchored early in tunnel scene; single continuous scope fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp earth, pooled water, flashlight glint) filters through Maya's analytical POV, constraining choices like water displacement analysis; lantern as micro-setting charges final image of holding it for "personal liberation."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover preventable death amid personal/professional control) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via overlooked evidence to note's corruption reveal narrowing options; agency in opening lantern, cost felt in career risk at close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of historical/present liberation emerges organically from lantern parallels without statement; final image merges "weight of history and possibility of personal liberation" as resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity in "scripted" death lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (analytical cataloging under emotional pressure); voice modulates rhythmically from calm observation to determined whisper. Brief officer dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Propulsion strong with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("entangled memories," "controlling influence" repeated across beats) and minor synonym churn dull density; no closure harm, but artifacts in reflective passages cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underground railroad lantern revealing modern corruption transforms escape trope via Maya's heritage; risk in personal/professional parallel feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
