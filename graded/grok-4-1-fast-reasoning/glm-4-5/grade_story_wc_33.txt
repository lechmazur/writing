<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's embodied adrenaline and micro-choice to quip "Momentous weather" to the guard crystallize his respectfully rebellious trait under peak pressure, earning the final smile; woman's brief interior via whisper adds relational crucible without headcount bloat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through planned shift-change drop to guards' entry tightening options; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as woman vanishes into shadows with bottle, cost legible in Elias's pretend deliveries and adrenaline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt neon and scarred booth constrain escape choreography, charging final puddles-and-lightning image; selective sensory hush amplifies heartbeats, mirroring internal tension without white-room drift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm motif reweights separation as temporary via bottle's reprise in woman's whisper and girl's distant sleep, offering non-literal answer to healing broken promises without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Heavy storm metaphors overload peak guard-entry beat without payoff pattern, creating minor figurative muddle; rhythm propels but paraphrase loops on "absences" and "lone mail drop" drag density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thunderstorm-as-message smuggles hope across drone borders transforms mailman trope via absence-linking ingenuity; final repricing of division through bottled weather feels inevitable and risky.</comment>
