<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait and motivation to excavate dreams compel precise actions like plunging into chill water and adding a personal note, earning endurance with embodied cost in the weighted inkwell. Minor slip in label-only phrasing ("stoically sensitive") without deeper embodied contradiction in peak recovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from surveying to box recovery to note-sealing, yielding Charged Poise closure where responsibility reconfigures his calling with felt heaviness. Orientation anchors early (shore surveyor at pavilion); one continuous scene fits scope; cost legible in "heavier than usual" inkwell line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion and inkwell as micro-settings constrain choices (wresting object, timed access post-drawbridge) and charge final image of sighing structure. Sensory hierarchy (chill water, hushed blaze oranges/purples) reflects POV's sensitive precision; details evolve causally with sunset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of documenting emotional histories tightens accumulatively via box discovery and personal note, narrowing to endurance with cost in solitary responsibility and foreclosed paths. Protagonist agency in wresting and sealing drives deepening under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of measuring abandoned dreams emerges organically from concrete actions (recovering cubes, adding note) without statements; final image of excavating heart's terrain offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting shore shifts as emotional ones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ghost-sensitive measurements and interlaced absences; voice modulates lyrically from precise contours to hushed blaze, with rhythmic control under evening pressure. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "submerged pavilion" and "antique traveling inkwell" (4+ mentions) create synonym churn dulling density in middle; figurative consistency (hushed blaze) propels but heavy in recovery beat. Rhythm varies well overall, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor as dream archeologist transforms coastal trope via specific pavilion recoveries and note ritual; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens emotional stakes without gimmick.</comment>
