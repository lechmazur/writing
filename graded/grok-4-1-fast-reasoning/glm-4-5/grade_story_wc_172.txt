<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (ruthless empire-builder haunted by birdsong silence, chest tightening), compelling release with visible cost (facade crack); final smile transformation earned by prior micro-choices like whispering indigenous words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure in final lines ("listened... heard it anyway"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost (hope echoes despite impossibility); orientation anchored in first sentence, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains choices (follows crack-map to center) and charges final image (rain washing footprints merges with horizon); selective sensory details (crystals biting knees, drops like bells) filtered through POV bias toward sacred geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo amid self-destruction) signaled early, deepens via uncontrollable rain tightening to realization; agency in release forecloses ruthless path with unmistakable cost (egg's impossibility honors loss).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fractured redemption emerges organically from particulars, final image offers resonant answer ("silence between thunderclaps, he heard it anyway") reweighting destruction-to-hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (deciphers cracks as sacred geometry, sentimental vault); rhythmic control modulates from purposeful crunch to grace under thunder pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful fractured motif; minor paraphrase loop in final para ("preserved... preserved hope") dulls slightly but doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms philanthropist trope via eco-destruction irony and lyric CR (egg release in own wasteland); risk-taking in quiet accumulative ending heightens stakes organically.</comment>
