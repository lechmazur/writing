<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority summarizes epiphanies without embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure, leaving change unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via seed reflections to CR closure in planting and commitment; orientation anchored early; conceptual cost legible in patience for unconventional growth.</comment>
