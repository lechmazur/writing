<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena's hesitation over the brooch reveals contradictory attachment and openness, earning her purpose-driven change; interiority embodied in trembling hands and imprinted palm. Minor diagnostic reflection ("thresh meaning") borders label-speak but anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rain trails to brooch discovery accumulates to exchange tightening, resolving in RR (Charged Poise) via dream/painting with relinquished talisman's cost legible in "ghostly warmth." Single scene progression coherent; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain trails and tidal shifts constrain discovery beat, lighthouse/sand anchor spatial choreography; brooch as recurring micro-setting charges final studio image, mirroring internal convergence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning from insomnia/trauma) signaled early, deepens via exchange narrowing attachment option with felt cost; under accumulative lens, pigment revelation and dream cadence shift reweight resilience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges organically from exchange and final paintings as "testimony"; brooch reprise reweights convergence without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of loss amid survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (rain trails obsession); dialogue subtextual ("belongs to island's memory") pursues goal; rhythmic diction modulates wryly earnest tone under revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("wryly earnest," brooch "warmth/pulsed") and synonym churn in reflections dull density slightly; rhythm varies, propulsion strong in exchange beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rain trails as navigation transform post-war trope into fresh obsession; exchange of pigments for brooch synthesizes survival ingenuity, risking quiet purpose over destruction drama.</comment>
