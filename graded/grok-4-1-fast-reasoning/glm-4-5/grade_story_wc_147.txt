<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in overriding training for discovery feels earned with embodied tension in "taking a deep, calculated breath"; internal conflict shows via contradictory impulses at door-seal moment, but epiphanies like vial "touched memories" lean summary over contradictory layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (vial fits depression → door opens → captures luminescence); on-page DC closure as vial fills with "swirling microcosm," cost legible in "oxygen alarm blared" and "burning in her lungs"; orientation anchored early in first paragraph, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Temple details like "massive columns... preserved in stunning detail" and "water began to swirl violently" constrain choices (sealed door, currents); recurring vial as micro-setting charges final pocket image; sensory hierarchy fits diver's urgency, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture mystery before oxygen depletion) signaled early, tightens causally via vial-press reversal narrowing options; agency in overriding instinct forces trade-off with "burning lungs," cost unmistakable in ascent beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing ephemeral emerges organically from vial filling with "entire histories compressed"; final image reweights prior risks non-literally without moralizing, but ambiguity lingers more in atmosphere than conflicted character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in explorer-biased details like "intricate carvings of sea creatures"; lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences in alarm blare); no dialogue, voice coherent without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak chamber beat ("shimmering luminescence... like captured starlight," mixed with "swirling microcosm"); "lonesome splendor" loops thrice without payoff pattern, dulling propulsion; strong verbs elsewhere, but artifact drags closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perfume vial as time-harness transforms trope of lost civilization into fresh synthesis (iridescent liquid captures ley-line energy); risk in overriding diver protocol heightens stakes organically, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
