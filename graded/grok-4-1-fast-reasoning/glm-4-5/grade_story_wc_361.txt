<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ayla's jittery trait embodies early via pack adjustment and pendant touch, evolving through micro-choices like sharing with traveler; final confidence renunciation of courier role earned by accumulated encounters with visible hollow-space cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pendant vibrations build density toward CR closure in "hollow space against her chest, yet she felt something new germinating within her own spirit"; cost legible in personal reconfiguration, structure fits single-shard default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora lights and ridgeway filter through Ayla's pendant-biased perception, constraining path choices; recurring pendant/earth shoots charge final "ground at her feet still trembled" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to deliver wonder accumulates texturally via extended encounters and earth response, tightening to personal endurance; cost felt in pendant's absence foreclosing old self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wonder-from-routine theme emerges organically from germination images shifting to internal ("germinating within her own spirit"); final line's "wonder wasn't delivered—it was awakened" borders thematic echo, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pendant-vibration notices; rhythmic prose modulates from jittery to poised, old woman's dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "vibrating sympathetically" pattern; no loops, rhythm varies to propel toward closure image without overwriting in peak delivery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pendant's vibration/extension mechanic transforms relic trope into wonder-germination synthesis, risking mythic tone that heightens closure reconfiguration inevitably.</comment>
