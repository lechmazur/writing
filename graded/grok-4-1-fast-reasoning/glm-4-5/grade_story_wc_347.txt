<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's reluctance clashes with heroic action, earning his peace at "his reluctant caretaker role might not be such a burden after all." Traits like exactness shown in assembly; internal conflict embodied in heavy heart yielding to purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery → assembly → labyrinth entry → guidance → CR closure with nut's dimming as cost in final orchard return. Orientation anchored early in orchard; one tightening via frost deadline narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth walls, mechanical birds, and forming frost constrain paths and force impressions method, charging final escape. Sensory details (echoing footfalls, glittering crystals) integrate via Elias's biased navigation under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save travelers) signaled early, escalates causally via voices and frost, forcing agency in hidden passage; cost legible in nut spent and risk with birds. Tightening forecloses dead-end death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Curse-to-blessing theme emerges organically from nut/device turning orchard power outward; final dawn image reconfigures burden without moralizing. Subtext in graceless movements contrasts heroic outcome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Elias-specific perception (shadow movements, thorniest patches); rhythmic prose modulates tension. No dialogue, but distant voices add urgency without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("graceless beauty," "offhandedly exact") creates minor loops across assembly/labyrinth beats, dulling propulsion; overwrought openings like "twilight painted" clichéd but vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (labyrinth, curse) transformed via impressions gift and nut device; fresh synthesis in relic repurposing feels inevitable at blueprint discovery and charged orchard reprise.</comment>
