<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation roots convincingly in the drawer pull and mantra, compelling the final forgiveness; Rennett's rigidity softens credibly. Interiority embodied via warm pull and wind-whipped hair, but "uncommonly thoughtful" labels constrain less than they tell, muting micro-choice tradeoffs at the ritual peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in mist/moon/drawer pull patterns to Charged Poise closure ("I apologize... I forgive" reconfigures resentments with emotional cost legible in thinned mist and gleaming pull). Single scene oriented early (parapet by para 1); one tightening via pull exchange suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, wind, and moon sliver constrain ritual timing and charge final image (pull in "moonlit circle," mist thins post-apology). Sensory hierarchy fits Lyra's priorities (moon tracker first); choreography coherent. Parapet isolation mirrors emotional stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional untethering beyond prisoners) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to cadence shift at apology/forgiveness with agency (Lyra offers pull) and felt relational cost. No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres via shared history. One deepening via Rennett's widened eyes suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges organically from pull/mantra/moon ritual, resonant in final image repricing resentments without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures; minor penalty for mantra echo nearing thesis ("recycle our mistakes into wisdom"). Complexity lingers in fragile timeframe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (moon sync, warm pull); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short breaths in "furrowed hush"). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("Neutral territory isn't just about geography"); voices distinct (Lyra soft/persuasive, Rennett rough). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but −0.8 for paraphrase loops ("uncommonly thoughtful," "neutral territory," mantra) and synonym churn (mist/ghosts/fog) dulling mid-beats; no closure touch. Rhythm varies; strong verbs anchor images (whipped hair, pooled moonlight). Minor template cadence in reflection blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diplomatic ritual with moon-sync mysticism and shared-father heirloom transforms prisoner exchange trope organically. Drawer pull/pull history inflections feel inevitable; risks poetic tone without gimmickry, heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
