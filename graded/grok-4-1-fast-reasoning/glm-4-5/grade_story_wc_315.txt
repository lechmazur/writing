<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve trust clear and intensifies with decoded message; embodied emotions in heart quickening and fingers flying. Weakness: repeated diagnostic labels like "attentively inventive" feel unearned without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static to anomalies to transmission; Charged Poise closure in final voice timbre surprising them, cost legible in belying burden's complexity. Orientation anchored early in arbor setup; one tightening via emergency protocol suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring buckle constrains evac choice and charges final anchor image; sensory details like rustling leaves without wind filter through watcher bias. Vivid thin atmosphere and canopy subtly mirror isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pattern interpretation tightens via contradicting anomalies and message; agency in sketching/transmitting forecloses complacency with felt vigilance cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of interpretive burden emerges organically from celestial evidence arrangement; final transmission offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting trust via irrefutable data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking; poetic rhythm modulates tension but repetitive phrasing slightly erodes distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "watcher's burden"/"weight" variants across paragraphs) and template cadence ("The [noun] [verb]" runs) dull propulsion; artifacts touch closure beat with redundant buckle reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arboreal sky vigil transforms isolation trope; world logic like hanging homes and star warnings feels inevitable and bold.</comment>
