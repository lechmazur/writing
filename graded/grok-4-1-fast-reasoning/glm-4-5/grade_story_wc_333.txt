<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to liberate potential is concrete and intensifies through ritual actions, with interior longing embodied in the mental chamber entry; micro-choices like circling and whispering reveal values under pressure. Minor slip in abstract epiphany phrasing ("the exquisite agony") lacks full contradiction, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from star-spotting to mental supernova (CR closure) with dissolving hair as felt conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored early at crossroads; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nexus stone constrains kneeling/pressing choice, starlight charges ritual and final ribbon image; sensory hierarchy (thickening air, cool stone, brightening stars) mirrors rising pressure through POV bias. Vivid, selective, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped idea) signaled early, escalates texturally via ritual deepening (circle → nexus fall → chamber unlock) narrowing mental options; cost legible in "ideas grow heavier" warning and hair dissolution charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of idea-liberation emerges organically from hair-thread-supernova progression, final image reweights fear-to-freedom without moralizing; resonant CR avoids tidy binary via lingering world-change implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature (star-noticing, ancient pathways) biased to locksmith's esoteric lens; rhythm modulates from murmur to whisper crescendo, purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "air thickened, stars brighter" advances propulsion and atmosphere); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("pulsing like captured star," "burst like supernova") during peak but pattern-taught, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical locksmith premise synthesizes ritual unlocking with mind-prison, bold mental-shard risk heightens stakes; final "another truth set free" feels inevitable from hair's starlight reprise.</comment>
