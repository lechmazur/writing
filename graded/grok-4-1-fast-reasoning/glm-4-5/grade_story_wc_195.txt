<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Solid interiority with embodied responses like "fingers trembled" and "hair on his arms stand erect," rooting motivation in withdrawal and pursuit of forbidden knowledge. Final change feels earned via ritual progression, but epiphanic summary ("understood now why he had withdrawn") slightly abstracts the knightly contradiction without full embodied cost at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to recitation to visionary overlap, delivering Charged Poise RR at "multiple realities overlapped" with irrevocable cost in "something within Galen had changed." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; single scene fits scope; cost legible in final reverence for program.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "crystalline fruit that chimed" and "phosphorescent vines" filter through Galen's pursuit, guiding ritual on the tree and charging closure with evolved fruits "speaking a language." Environment constrains via sanctuary and tools like tree branches; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via study-recitation-gestures to visionary tightening that narrows to changed guardian role. Agency in "practiced gestures" and "murmured allegiance" forecloses ordinary life with felt paradox cost ("profound cold and transcendent warmth"); one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge transcending ordinary service emerges organically from ritual and vision, reweighted in final image of fruits "speaking" and tucked program without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like shifting ink avoids platitudes; protagonist arc ties to thematic question of withdrawal's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in mystical bias ("ink seemed to shift"); lyrical diction and rhythm modulate to peak intensity at reality overlap without head-hopping. Prose texture distinct and controlled, perceptual filter consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; no loops or scaffolds, but minor overwriting in peak like "shimmered with its own unique light, reaching out...with silent invitations" slightly blurs propulsion before closure. Figuratives integrate without muddle; clean grammar supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly retreat with marionette metaphysics into "unsnapped" realities; patterns transform trope via specific gestures and program. Risky lyric accumulation heightens mystical stakes organically, culminating in guardian reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
