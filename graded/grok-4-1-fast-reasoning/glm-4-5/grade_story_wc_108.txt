<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied phobias and adaptive traits drive micro-choices like breathing techniques and decryption under pressure, earning the final defiant stand; minor diagnostic label-speak in mantra ("vulnerability is power") slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hiding/decryption to Charged Poise closure where Maya reconfigures identity with felt phobia cost; orientation anchored early in library scene, one tightening via decrypted "Return" coordinates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stars' phosphorescent glow enables decryption and charges final confrontation shadows, constraining choices; selective sensory details (groaning doors, ticking clock) mirror internal tension without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit via truth) escalates accumulatively through phobia-tightened decryption to stance crystallization; visible cost in relinquished control legible at "trembling certainty" stand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal theme emerges organically via seashell/mantra particulars, resonating in final self-reconfiguration; slight echo risk in explicit "greatest strength...deepest fears" line borders statement over image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (phobia-narrowed senses) and rhythmic modulation under stress; distinct internal voice via concrete embodiment avoids filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in fear descriptors ("trembling," "heart pounding") and repetitive Maya stems dull some density; strong propulsion overall, but −0.6 artifact pack for synonym churn in high-pressure decryption beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double/heiress betrayal with seashell decryption transforms tropes; risk in vulnerability arc feels organic, though premise echoes identity-swap familiarity without bold subversion.</comment>
