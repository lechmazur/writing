<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority in sleep-deprived trembling fingers and whispers to jasmine reveals methodically hopeful traits under insomnia pressure, with motivation rooted in systematic research compelling the all-night painting. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents higher band; steady hope endures without deep internal fracture. Final smile vindicates arc with felt cost of endless nights.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oriented early via painter's climb to greenhouse; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as daydream density intensifies with moon rise, culminating in Charged Poise CR at dawn admiration where hope reconfigures insomnia stake with conceptual cost of perpetual pursuit. One tightening via visions suffices; no causality breaks or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlight spilling on worktable sparks daydreams, constraining brush use and charging final mural image; rooftop greenhouse thins smog while jasmine/ink scents filter through POV priorities. Saffron quiet via stained glass evolves with dawn, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Recurrent moon and plants tactilely guide all-night action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to resurrect kindness via lost symbols signaled early, escalates accumulatively through intensifying visions that deepen certainty and narrow to endurance against insomnia/city anonymity. Agency in persistent painting forecloses sleep with on-page cost; moon-forced trade-off charges final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of trans-temporal kindness emerges organically from painted symbols and visions of ancient empathy, resonating in final mural as non-literal answer. Penalty for near-thematic echo in "kindness was humanity's oldest language" line, bordering moralizing; ambiguity lingers in hoped-for stranger's response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with painterly perceptual signature in sensory biases like jasmine mingling with ink; rhythmic prose modulates from methodical to visionary intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; voice distinct in elevated yet embodied diction fitting insomniac artist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid sensory propulsion, but −0.6 for paraphrase loops like repeated "lost voices/symbols" and "daydreams intensified" across middle beats dulling momentum without pattern payoff. Minor template cadence in sequential stroke descriptions; rhythm varies but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonstone brush resurrecting kindness across lost languages transforms insomniac solitude trope; waxing moon's live escalation and saffron quiet tone feel inevitable and riskily lyrical. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in CR payoff.</comment>
