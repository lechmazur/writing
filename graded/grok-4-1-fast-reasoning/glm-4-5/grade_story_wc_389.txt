<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to shape dawn from shadows is clear and consistent, rooted in patience and isolation; however, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, relying on reflective summary over embodied micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of patterns builds from fragments to prophet's rise; CR closure in final smile reconfigures role with legible isolation cost, taught early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory constrain vigil and charge final humming image, with sensory details (ozone-stained fingers, cobweb patterns) filtered through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of signal translation tightens accumulatively via clearer prophecies matching prophet, forcing endurance with isolation cost felt in ongoing vigil; agency in patient listening coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truths in static emerges organically from particulars like transmissions and portico visions; final dawn image resonantly reweights premise of translation over leadership without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature on frequencies/patterns; rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in transmission descriptions ("unfold like puzzle pieces... gradually formed a narrative") and repetitive Elias stems dull density; overwriting metaphors consistent but reduce propulsion in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-encoded ancestral signals and floatstone isolation transforms hermit-prophet trope; reflective span risks bold structure heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
