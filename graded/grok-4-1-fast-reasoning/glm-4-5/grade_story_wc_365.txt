<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover withheld truth roots consistently in fragmented memories and intensifies through expanding perception; interiority embodied in trembling fingers and thrumming glass. Earned endurance in final determination despite receding discoveries shows contradictory persistence without epiphanic abstraction touching closure. Minor abstract phrasing like "pushing the boundaries of human consciousness" slightly dilutes specificity but does not flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via cyclic jumps and holds to Charged Poise closure at dream door, where shard's heat and dimming impose legible cost ("shard now lay dim... power temporarily spent"). Mosaic shards taught by first transition (~15%), legible across timelines. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via deeper journeys to door.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard as micro-setting constrains choices (hot preventing red shard contact) and charges final image (dim in palm). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (warm/alive glass via map maker's expertise); bay evolves across timelines mirroring internal fraying. Dust motes bookend, grounding spatial coherence without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth discovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via density of witnessed timelines and navigation learning, tightening to door tease where prevention forecloses revelation with felt cost. Agency in persistent weaving/reaching; no coincidence resolution. Final determination crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge's hidden weight emerges organically from memory gaps, evasive voices, and door's tease, resonating in final brighter determination amid receding dreams without moralizing. Shard reprise shifts from key to spent, reweighting pursuit's cost. Invites ambiguity on truth's protection across infinities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sensory charting (ridges pulsing histories); voice texture modulates rhythmically from tremulous to determined. Compression in jump transitions purposeful/legible under mosaic pattern. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to unseen realms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "reality began to fray... shimmering possibilities"); rhythm varies for propulsion, accelerating in jumps. Minor paraphrase loops in "half-remembered dreams/murmurs" purposeful for motif, not obscuring closure. No artifacts in peak door beat; syntactic variety supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and multiverse weaving transforms tropes via lived navigation and withheld-truth calculus; risk in cyclic spontaneity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Shard-red denial inflects organically from pattern. No derivative echoes; premise commits to implications.</comment>
