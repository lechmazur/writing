<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused love's storage roots in past-life memory and intensifies via breath choices, earning her transformation into a keeper of light. Interiority embodied in warming pearl and tears during revelation. Minor therapy-speak ("unused love transformed into light") dilutes peak contradiction without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from breath shifts to projection clarity and pearl dissolution as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting love's storage with emotional cost in tears and foreclosed pilgrim identity. Orientation anchored early at viaduct. Closure cost legible in "pearl grew lighter, dissolving into her skin."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy: wisteria scent, mist, blooms constrain projection on viaduct wall and charge final image as they "glow brighter." Foggy lucidity mirrors internal revelation, evolving causally. Recurrent viaduct anchors all shards without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via breath deepening images and pearl's warmth, forcing stance crystallization on love's form. Agency in "inhaled deeply, a conscious decision to breathe differently." Cost felt in tears but lacks sharper trade-off foreclosing a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of love's transformation emerges organically from breath, pearl, and projection; final image of dissolving tear answers "where unused love is stored" non-literally via "space between breaths." Woman's echoed question reinforces without moralizing. Resonant reprise avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light-bending and foggy lucidity; rhythmic diction modulates from mystery to clarity under revelation pressure. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor loops in "twilight viaduct in bloom" (4x) and "breathing" repetitions create template cadence without payoff, dulling mid-beats. Rhythm varies naturally; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura, Kwan Yin tear, and breath-revelation transforms spiritual tropes into textured healing arc. Risky lyric accumulation on love's storage feels inevitable in hindsight via pearl's dissolution.</comment>
