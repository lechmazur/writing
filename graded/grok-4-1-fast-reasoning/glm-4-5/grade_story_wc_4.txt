<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "perceptively calm demeanor" and "earnest whimsy" dominate without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously, making the final change feel observational rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page RR closure in the circle and final image ("puzzle had been solved"); cost felt in transmuted pain, though tightening via group arrival is mild; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of lavender fragrance and swaying, factory vines recurring to mirror renewal and charge final image; setting guides ritual placement without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening or option-narrowing under Accumulative lens; group participation deepens density mildly without reversal, cost, or agency test; abstract tragedy undermines visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-shared-understanding emerges organically from arcs and ritual, resonant in final tapestry image; subtext in decay/renewal avoids overt morals but borders on articulate thesis ("transmuting pain into a masterpiece").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward arcs/energy; lyrical diction and rhythm modulate effectively; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("Today, we will use these arcs..."); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on vines/lavender and repetitive phrasing ("seemed to," "as [element]"); rhythmic variety good overall, but minor overwriting in descriptive beats dulls peak density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle archivist ritual in decayed/renewing setting transforms healing trope through specific arcs/photos; earnest whimsy risks sentiment but commits boldly to premise without hedging.</comment>
