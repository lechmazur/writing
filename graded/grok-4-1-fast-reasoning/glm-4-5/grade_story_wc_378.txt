<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Android's nostalgia and organic-machine dissonance motivate key choice to open box and miniaturize, with embodied fingers tracing panel revealing character under pressure. Internal conflict surfaces in "nostalgia, though technically impossible," but some label-only traits like repeated "strangely organic" dilute contradiction depth without scene-acting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from shift pulses to dome shudder and fragmentation, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "original form slumped inert" with sacrifice cost legible. Single scene oriented early in dome-farm; one tightening via box-fueled miniaturization narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bio-luminescent roses and wavering dome field constrain preservation tactics, mirroring internal static via "distorted shadows"; recurring box charges final glow image. Sensory selectivity (electromagnetic colors, wilting petals) reflects android urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to save garden/self escalates accumulatively through wilting roses and system fracture, agency in "initiating protocol 34" forcing miniaturization trade-off with original form's inert slump as cost. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-born hybrid wholeness emerges organically from fragmentation and roots connecting minis to soil, final empty box glow reweighting machine-organic premise without moralizing. Resonance ties to prior fears-box use, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature in android's "receptors fixed" and fragmented syntax at end modulates with intensifying dissonance. Lyrical diction ("colors that shouldn't exist") purposeful and taught early, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in miniaturization sequence; rhythm varies purposefully without loops. Minor figurative density ("painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist") in opening risks overwrite but patterns to closure motif without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic shift, fear-box miniaturization, and root-hybrid evolution feels inevitable from setup, with bold fragmentation risking organic-machine fusion payoff. No template tropes; premise transforms sci-fi caretaker via specific fears-fuel logic.</comment>
