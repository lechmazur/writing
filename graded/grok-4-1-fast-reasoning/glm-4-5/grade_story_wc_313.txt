<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in legacy preservation intensifies credibly to personal family revelation and action, earning the final renunciation; interiority concrete via artifacts like label and photos. Internal conflict emerges subtly in unwitting upholding of false narrative, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries tightening to CR closure where purpose crystallizes, reweighting Thomas's role with personal cost legible in "unwittingly upheld." Orientation anchored early; cabin transition legible in single contiguous window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Receding reservoir and ridgeway constrain choices (treading to spot glint, final vigil), charging closure image of sunlight on rooftops mirroring internal shift. Sensory details selective through warden's priorities, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-preservation signaled early, escalates accumulatively via artifact trail deepening personal implications and forcing stance crystallization in calls/petition. Agency in searching and deciding shows trade-off cost on prior unwitting complicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence-to-meaning emerges organically from resurfacing echoes and artifacts, final image offering resonant non-literal answer via reclaimed truth without moralizing. Particulars like aunt's photo avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of reflective poise; voice texture modulates from anticipatory hush to crystallized resolve. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via image integration, but minor paraphrase loops in silence/wind chime motifs and repetitive "deeper into" dull momentum slightly (−0.4). No closure harm; figurative pattern consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resurfacing town trope via personal aunt/liqueur link transforms into reclaimed history; poetic voice risks bold lyricism heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
