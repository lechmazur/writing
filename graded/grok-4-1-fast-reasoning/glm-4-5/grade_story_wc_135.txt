<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elina's reactively visionary trait and motivation to compile fragments drive consistent micro-choices, like handling the valve and diary, earning her transformation; embodied visions show internal conflict without therapy-speak. Minor epiphanic summaries slightly dilute peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via staggered visions and revelations to Charged Poise closure in final image of valve on desk reconfiguring absences into presence; cost felt in honoring pain. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via diary suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's pale stones, briny air, and post-rain gleam constrain Elina's archival work and charge final image; sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities. Environment evolves to mirror healing, guiding choices without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling meaning tightens accumulatively through revelations narrowing exile's pain into rebuildable possibility; agency in sharing truths forecloses despair with legible emotional cost. Fits length with one deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of navigated absences emerges organically from fragments-to-tapestry arc, culminating in resonant final image reweighting loss as chapter without moralizing; subtext in visions invites ambiguity on recovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with visionary perceptual signature; rhythmic lyricism modulates from anticipatory to poised, fitting accumulative lens. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but "staggered intervals" and "absences" loops create minor paraphrase churn across paragraphs, dulling some propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary archivist navigating exile's gaps transforms tropes via specific valve/diary beats; risky lyric accumulative frame heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
