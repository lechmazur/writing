<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face blindness as perceptual gift drives coin decoding and final craft, with contradictory impulses (essence over appearance) acting in discovery beat; earned renunciation of literal sky mirroring forecloses prior path with library loss cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to coin's algorithmic key; CR closure in "shimmered with a network of interlocking patterns" reconfigures art with conceptual cost of transient library, pocket slip legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlight "constellations on the floor that seemed to shift" anchors and mirrors pattern vision, constraining pre-dawn craft; final walls' shimmer charges closure image under body/tool filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky-mirroring stake signaled early deepens via coin to soul patterns, protagonist agency in clay mold narrowing options; demolition "mechanical sounds" make time cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transcendent perception emerges from particulars like coin indentations; final "effect of faces without defining them" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third POV stable with pattern-biased noticing ("spaces between rather than the details"); rhythmic modulation in "hush before demolition" heightens stillness under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in crafting sequence ("pressed the coin into clay"); purposeful "patterns" texture avoids loops, though minor perception-synonym churn nudges down slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's fractal coin decode synthesizes disability trope into soul-pattern ingenuity; risk of solo perceptual quest heightens stakes organically to closure.</comment>
