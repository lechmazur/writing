<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in ambition driving her climb and dedication, with earned change in realizing the seed as teacher during moonlit vigil. Interiority concrete via scents and whispers, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Flaws like unchecked ambition resolve too tidily without complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed pulsing to filaments revealing guardian nature, with CR closure in final realization reweighting ambition (cost: transformed purpose felt in welcoming visitors). Orientation anchored early (Elara on bridges at dawn). One tightening via days blurring to moonlit opening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (scents, mists) selective and POV-biased toward olfaction, integrating into action like guiding her climb. Treetop platforms constrain perch choice; recurring doodle paper charges final image. Wildflower hush bookends tone purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed breakthrough) signaled early, with accumulative deepening via scent changes and opening narrowing to insight. Minimal opposition; no live option foreclosed beyond time dedication. Cost legible but low (fluid movements gained, no trade-off).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of deep listening emerges via doodles/seed patterns, resonating in final image of serenity. Elara's explanation ("undercurrent of wisdom") is thematic echo in penultimate paragraph, flattening subtlety (-0.4). Complexity lingers in ambition's shift without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in scent/doodle focus; voice lyrical and consistent ("turning of the tide's thought"). Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven (explaining to visitors). Rhythmic modulation supports quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("serenity within motion," "wildflower hush," "turning of the tide's thought") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs (-0.6). Figurative density purposeful but overwrites high-focus beats like vigil. Propulsion strong overall, syntax varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as guardian library with doodle journals transforming ambition. Treetop olfaction and family custom feel organic, not templated. Risk in poetic phrasing heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
