<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength roots her dance choices consistently, earning the closure transformation. Interiority feels concrete through embodied dance but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no strong internal conflict shown in pivotal dance crescendo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual to crescendo unlock (screens flicker), culminating in CR closure where final image reweights vulnerability with conceptual cost of reshaped power. Orientation anchors early (sunken lab, Elara's dance). Single scene fits defaults; one tightening via dance sequence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory vividly filters through Elara's priorities (coral-encrusted corners, dripping pipes constrain dance). Recurring console charges final dice drop image. Sensory hierarchy suits urgency, with tactile water integrating into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate via dance/dice) signaled early; accumulative escalation via crescendo narrows to systems stirring, forcing stance crystallization in revelation. Agency in dance forecloses conventional paths with felt cost of defiance. Minor abstractness in stakes before climax slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically from dance rituals and revelation, resonating in final web metaphor reprise. Elara's dialogue to Lydia ("Sometimes the most vulnerable systems...") borders overt statement, diluting subtext in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with lyrical perceptual signature (dance as algorithm). Prose texture distinct in fluid syntax; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual. Q7 debt caps per global rules.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive "as a spider spins its web" (4x) forms taught pattern but creates paraphrase loops, dulling propulsion in reflective beats. Some overwriting in descriptions (e.g., "purposeful grace... explanations") stacks modifiers without density payoff. Rhythm varies but template stems recur in openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-codebreaking in aquatic lab transforms tropes (dice as RNG ally). Risky lyric mode heightens stakes via embodied algorithms, inevitable in hindsight through familiar mystery payoff.</comment>
