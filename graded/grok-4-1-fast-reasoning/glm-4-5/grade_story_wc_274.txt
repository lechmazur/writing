<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict shown in "frozen between what she must do and what she could do," with embodied reactions like racing heart and struggling breath stabilizers compelling the upload choice. Final shift to liberator feels earned by prior hesitation. Minor slips in label-speak like "bravely conflicted" slightly abstract the embodiment at peak decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: power fluctuation causes thaw → letter discovery → upload decision → charged poise closure. Orientation anchors immediately in Elena's role and Antarctic facility. Closure delivers Charged Poise in "sat on the cold floor and waited," with legible cost of impending consequences and broken oath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Echoing library under snow and cryogenic chill constrain access to networks and mirror internal turmoil effectively. Thermal suit and breath stabilizers ground body in setting during upload. Repetitive phrasing of silence slightly dulls selectivity at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs. liberate truth) signaled early, tightens causally via discovery to upload agency, foreclosing duty path. Cost visible in "face cryonic suspension or worse" and oath break, charging final wait. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's freedom emerges organically from whisper "Knowledge cries out to be free" and thawing history image, reweighting control vs. revelation. Final "hum of history beginning to thaw" resonates without moralizing. Explicit "provoke an unspoken conversation" borders on thematic echo, softening subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent cryogenic perceptual bias (e.g., echoing thoughts in silence). Voice texture literary but marred by repetitive phrasing like "echoing library under snow." No dialogue to judge; distance apt for internal drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops on silence/quiet/echoing ("profound silence," "dizzying quiet") and template repetition ("within the blink that follows surprise" x2, "echoing library under snow" x3+) create churn, dulling propulsion at decision peak. Some overwriting in emotional summaries like "motivation crystallized." Rhythms vary but density suffers from redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cryogenic archive whistleblower premise freshened by amber-light data and dormant networks, with upload ripples offering ingenious global spread. Transformation of preserver role feels organic. Slight template vibe in lone-hero-rebel arc tempers boldness.</comment>
