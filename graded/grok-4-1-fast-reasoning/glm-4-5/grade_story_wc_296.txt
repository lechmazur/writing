<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Warlike serenity embodies consistent motivation through vortex pressure, culminating in blood sacrifice micro-choice that reveals value hierarchy; interiority concrete in layered consciousness without stock epiphanies. Blind spots balanced by struggle against curse layers. Final acceptance of mentor's glamour earns change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as expanding circles build density to CR closure: mentor's true face revealed with blood cost legible in seed-to-plant transformation and withered remains. Orientation anchored early at vortex edge. Single scene causality intact, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex, cursed lake, and pulsing seed constrain choices (roots encircle ice) and charge final image of stilling magic; sensory hierarchy (whispering fruit, brushing leaves) filtered through druid's magical priorities. Details evolve causally with search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Circles accumulate pressure under Accumulative lens, deepening curse knowledge to narrow options at plant activation; blood sacrifice as agency forecloses safe path with visible cost, charging ice-devouring climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mentor’s true face as non-literal answer to "mirrors don't show" reweights hidden identity premise organically from particulars; ambiguity lingers in glamour's generational lie without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in magical layering; rhythmic prose heightens circle intensity without head-hopping. Mentor’s brief dialogue distinct in weighty idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Patterned circle progression teaches texture without loop penalty; minor "swirling" synonym churn dulls select beats, but density propels to closure image. Varied rhythm supports serenity under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Carnivorous plant devouring magical ice to unveil glamour transforms fantasy tropes through specific magical logic; fresh synthesis of mirrors, circles, and identity ties inevitably to closure.</comment>
