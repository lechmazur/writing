<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's adaptive philosophy and locket-tied backstory compel eclipse plan with embodied caution; Lila's tentative drumming to speech shows internal conflict resolving in hug, earning fragile change without therapy-speak dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as session pattern and eclipse density culminate in RR (Lila's whisper reconfigures silence); orientation anchors early, causal buildup from room to ridge tightens to on-page cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sagebrush and ridge constrain ridge-top choice for eclipse viewing; locket as micro-object charges final touch, sensory hush mirrors internal states without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence stake signaled early deepens via eclipse rhythm into speech agency; one tightening (drumming confidence) forecloses isolation with cautious cost legible in "fragile but real" bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via music/eclipse parallels, reweighting wonder in final image; Lila's "sun came back... like music" borders thematic echo, softening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature filters via music/nature bias; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, child idiom distinct; rhythm modulates to hushed intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied rhythm, but sage/ridge paraphrase loops and "dreaming roots" overwriting dull mid-density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eclipse-music therapy synthesis transforms trauma healing trope via celestial stakes; locket curl adds fresh personal anchor without gimmick.</comment>
