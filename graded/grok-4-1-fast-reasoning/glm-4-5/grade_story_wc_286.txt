<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via bone-thrum and potter-tool micro-choices under mystery pressure; sharp gentleness trait consistent and particular. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test, but earns realization via accumulation without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation (wasteland to oasis by para 2); closure as CR in final image of shaping invisible clay reweights resistance premise with world's-forgetfulness cost. Persistent glass constraint shapes tactics; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oasis micro-setting (hives, flowers, smoke) constrains choices (tools on earth, glass on hives) and charges closure vigil; POV-biased sun-pattern noticing vivid and selective. Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand resistance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timeline resolution into vibrant present; agency in nurturing forecloses dormancy path with felt cost of ongoing vigil. Escalation via pattern-deepening under lens coherent, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love's memory resisting decay emerges organically from bee-stirring and flower-tilting particulars; final "loyal memory of love" CR reweights premise non-literally with oblique world's-loss cost. No moralizing, ambiguity in return-resolution lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with potter-specific perceptual signature (circular hands, sun-pattern lens); rhythmic diction modulates from deliberate steps to thrum-intensity without drift. Lyrical compression taught early via glass-fractures pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., smoke-flattening bends light/portals); purposeful thrum/smoke repetition builds texture without loops. Minor figurative density in "phototropic to kindness" risks overwrite but pattern-taught; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter-kindness reviving timeline-fractured oasis transforms wasteland trope via sun-pattern/beehive particulars; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitability without gimmick. Non-obvious CR feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
