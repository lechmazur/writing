<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in petrichor obsession intensifies credibly to compel cavern immersion; interiority concrete via psychometry glimpses. Final transformation earned by cumulative sensory echoes, with embodied cost in shifted self-understanding. Minor slip: "hinged awakening" phrasing borders on unearned epiphany label at first use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory glimpses builds to CR closure where compass realization reweights life premise with conceptual cost ("boundary...dissolved entirely"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (cliffs, study). One tightening via compass spin narrowing to lagoon suffices; structure fits two shards seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Limestone crevice and obsidian lagoon constrain descent/immersion choices, with phosphorescent algae charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (earthy petrichor to blue glow) filters via Elara's priorities, vivid and purposeful. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent from crevice to water's edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mystery boundary) signaled early, tightens texturally via three awakenings forcing stance crystallization in water. Agency in psychometry/immersion forecloses rational path with felt conceptual cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from petrichor-to-lagoon particulars, final vial uncork reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in "signal" image tensions economic loss with revelation. Resonance from conflicted rational/mystical impulses lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature (scent-water echoes); rhythm modulates from anticipatory to hushed intensity. Voice distinct in sensory diction ("polished obsidian reflecting...stars"). "You're late" felt-voice integrates as implication, not dialogue artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sense/action without loops; rhythm varies (short cave breaths to long realizations). Minor purple ("primordial darkness") purposeful for tone, no muddle in peak algae beat. Clean syntax, no scaffolds dulling closure vial image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Petrichor-psychometry synthesis fresh, transforming "eccentric hobby" trope via compass/lagoon logic into inevitable CR. Risk in solo mystical delve heightens stakes organically. No templates; hindsight inevitability from factory "signal."</comment>
