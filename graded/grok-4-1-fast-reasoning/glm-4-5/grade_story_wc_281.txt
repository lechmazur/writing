<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Earned shift from affectionate skepticism to conviction via embodied somatic markers (heart rate, chill) tied to brother's plight; interior contradiction acts in scene through doubt battling awe at geode patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from setup to geode vibration projecting neural patterns; CR closure in final geode-at-heart image reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of fragile hope unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Studio equipment and geode sliver constrain choices (positioned under lens, light choreography), charge final packing image; selective sensory details (pulsing light, soft vibration) mirror neural mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate pathways for brother/victims) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via geode's neural patterns forcing protocol; cost felt in aching heart and endured skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing fractured minds emerges organically from geode-science bridge; resonant CR in final image reweights skepticism without moralizing, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters through skeptic's precise observations (e.g., "fractally precise"); voice modulates with intensity but minor repetition erodes distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("muscovite geode sliver," "fractally precise," "illuminate hidden pathways" repeated 5+ times each) create template cadence, dulling propulsion in core experiment beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting, somatic markers, and geode pseudoscience transforms telepathy fallout into neurological healing; geode's evolution feels inevitable and riskily inventive.</comment>
