<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's ritual of placing the tessera and renaming feels earned from consistent rebuild traits under desolation pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from memory visions to ritual cadence shift; closure as RR/Charged Poise lands on-page in "mosaic seemed brighter... acknowledging aberrant mercy," reconfiguring ruins with felt cost of enduring tragedy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone and tessera constrain ritual choice and charge final gleaming image, with selective sensory details (ash whisper, enameled pulse) mirroring renewal potential without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant renewal stake signaled early via rebuild drive; accumulative deepening in tracing-to-renaming tightens internal pressure coherently, but external stakes remain abstractly low with soft visceral cost beyond persistent sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-mercy emerges organically from mosaic ritual and final image of transformed sky; resonant non-literal answer in "We are not the fire... rises from the ashes," though speech borders explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature biased toward historical ghosts; rhythmic modulation fits lyric mode, but elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "warm coldness") in ritual peak overwhelms propulsion without payoff tightening; minor synonym churn on "fractured/chipped" dulls key mosaic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Renaming ritual via retrocognitive mosaic offers fresh inflection on post-apocalypse renewal, transforming tropes through specific historical language and aberrant mercy synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
