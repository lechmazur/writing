<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via lineage and seasonal purpose, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; backstory like borrowed heartbeat feels told via reflection blocks exceeding BRR without strong micro-choice anchors. Interiority concrete yet leans on stock mystical phrasing ("centuries of practice") without deep flaws complicating peak choices. Final fulfillment earned but endurance cost (melancholy) underplays internal ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via building mist, rain, hum, and prismatic effects tightening to revelation; single continuous scene oriented clearly by para 2 (painter on terrace pre-dawn spring). Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final para ("connection eased, leaving...melancholy"), reconfiguring purpose with felt separation cost. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet after rain vividly constrains choices (traced wet stone fractures image) and charges final image (mirrors revert to plain wall); sensory hierarchy (visual rainbows, tactile droplets, auditory hum/echoes/bells) filtered through painter's perceptual bias toward reflective magic. Atmosphere dusky harmony tensions possibility/actuality threshold. Micro-setting (parapet, terrace) evolves causally with rain awakening resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuade mirrors pre-noon/bells) signaled early, tightens texturally via rain amplification, crescendo hum, and heartbeat pulse forcing stance crystallization at tolling. Agency in humming/standing at threshold forecloses paths with visible cost (quickened pulse, post-revelation melancholy). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of glimpsed possibilities vs. ordinary limits emerges organically from mirror visions (alternate lives) and recurring images (rainbows, reflections) reweighted in climax; final "plain wall" offers non-literal resonant answer with lingering ambiguity/melancholy cost. Subtext in overlooked magic (children's songs) avoids moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-3rd POV with perceptual signature biased to reflective surfaces/magic hush; rhythm modulates from calm setup to crescendo intensity. Whispers/murmurs natural, goal-driven (self-motivation). No head-hopping; diction controlled, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers traced wet stone, prism caught movements" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, read-aloud natural. Minor paraphrase loops ("echoing terrace" thrice, purposeful pattern) and elevated diction fit voice but nudge down; no closure-touching artifacts or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical lineage, mirror portals via children's songs, and terrace-heartbeat bond transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes toward conceptual closure without gimmickry. Final vanishing feels inevitable from seasonal elusiveness.</comment>
