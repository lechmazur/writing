<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotions (scaled chest warming, translucent edges shifting) and contradictory impulses (homesickness vs. excitement); final transformation earned through practiced waiting and focusing on pendant energy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pendant warming to superimposed realities, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("stepped forward, leaving the frozen garden"); cost legible in transformed homesickness and foreclosed passivity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (crystalline petals shifting to indigo/silver, mist oscillations revealing realities) filter through POV and constrain choices (gazing at boundaries, navigating light currents); charges final image of flowing light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness vs. befriending uncertainty) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (focusing interiorizing on pendant narrows to form shift); agency in conscious draw forecloses waiting with legible cost of nowhere-belonging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from particulars (interiorizing evolution, boundaries dissolving); final image resonates non-literally, but late reflective summary ("had learned that...") borders on stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (foggy lucidity, dimensional gaze); rhythmic prose modulates from contemplative to excited ("profound excitement"), supporting pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful recurrence ("boundaries of light," "waiting") avoids loops, but minor figurative density in peak shifts (roses trembling/radiating) risks slight overwrites without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian, dimensional mist-garden, and interiorizing transforms exile trope; bold lyric risk in foggy lucidity payoff ("belonging everywhere and nowhere") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
