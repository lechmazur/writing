<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal need beyond duty intensifies through pattern recognition to high-stakes breach; embodied reactions like "skipped her breath" and "static electricity" ground interiority. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene, mostly forward drive without deep internal friction at pivotal lie moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density (731, patch, songs) builds to CR closure in download/disappearance amid alarms, with felt career cost legible in "her career, possibly her freedom, ended." Orientation anchored early in archive role; one tightening at restricted access breach narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive as micro-setting constrains via "grayed out" sectors and "warning symbols," forcing lie; recurring patch charges realization and final memory image. Sensory selectivity (flickering static, streaming files) reflects Elara's attentive bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover cold case truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pattern deepening to alarms; agency in lie/download forecloses safe path with on-page cost (security breach). Tightening at folder discovery changes knowledge decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of indelible truth emerges organically from archive clues and "the archive doesn't lie, but people do" line, reweighted in CR realization without moralizing. Final disappearance image resonates as non-literal answer to deletion/silencing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-as-constellations noticing; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating to urgency in alarms. No dialogue; rhythmic compression fits accumulative build without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense metaphors ("digital necropolis," "ghosts in the machine") purposeful but verge on overwrite in opening beats, with minor paraphrase loops around 731 recurrence. Propulsion strong overall; closure image clear without artifacts dulling impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital forensics and cosmic conspiracy via archive clues transforms cold case trope; patch anomaly and numbers offer non-obvious angle. Bold risk in accumulative pattern drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
