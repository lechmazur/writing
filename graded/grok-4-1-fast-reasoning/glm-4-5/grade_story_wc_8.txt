<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in scholarly pursuit drives discoveries, with "emotionally rational temperament" enabling objectivity amid betrayal evidence; however, lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on summary labels like "acknowledging the profound human cost."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to ledger find (CR closure with conceptual cost to obscured history in final lines); orientation anchored early in station entry; single scene coherent, one tightening at breakthrough sense leading to floorboard reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy and Victorian details selectively integrated via goal-directed action (e.g., carvings matching letter), mirroring internal quest and charging final image ("ivy would continue to grow... truth would flourish"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward historical cues; constrains path to corner discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via parallel-drawing and initials photo to ledger payoff, narrowing options with felt human cost; agency in methodical search forces deepening; closure cost legible in silenced voices gaining place.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from particulars (accident cover-up vs. ledger), reweighted in final image contrasting ivy concealment with flourishing truth; resonant non-literal answer to deception's cost without moralizing; avoids tidy resolution via lingering ambiguity of noble intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in historical precision (e.g., architectural matches); voice texture academic-historian's, modulating slightly with light filtering; no dialogue; minor filter-verb stacks in discoveries but legible under accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("noble lies," "recapture," "pit of lies") create paraphrase churn across middle beats, dulling density; some template cadence in discovery sentences (e.g., "matched... perfectly"); rhythm varies but overwriting in metaphors like ivy clawing harms propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle on historical revisionism via letter-led quest transforms trope; ledger discovery feels earned from particulars; ivy-truth contrast memorable but edges clichéd; synthesis organic without bold risks reaching elite ingenuity.</comment>
