<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover intentions drives patient decoding with embodied actions like tender fingers and soft smile; final gasp earns shift from romantic to sacrificial realization with conceptual cost. Minor slip in summarizing "blithe nature giving way" without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to thread-decoding, pattern breaks at sacrificial twist, CR closure reweights intentions with guarded-truth cost in "some truths were meant to remain guarded." Orientation anchored early in silo under stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt silo as absorbing cocoon constrains silence for echo-hearing and charges final reset/exit image; velveteen gloom evolves from deepening to protective, mirroring revelation. Sensory selection (hum, melody like water over stones) filters through Elias's absorbed priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode intentions signaled early, escalates via accumulating thread-secrets (woman's love to sacrificial exchange), agency in untangling forecloses romantic assumption with revelation cost. Under accumulative lens, single decisive deepening suffices but lacks explicit trade-off beyond processing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of death-as-transformation emerges organically from echoes proving persistent love/sacrifice; final image of reset clock and dawn offers non-literal resonance on guarded truths without moralizing. Counter-reading in sacrificial twist adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in work-absorption (vibrating threads, audible voices); rhythmic prose modulates from humming calm to gasped revelation. No elision or head-hopping; diction fits intuitive gardener.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines integrate setting/action (cobalt walls absorbing sound); no loops, varied rhythm, zero artifacts even in peak decoding. "Velveteen gloom" purposeful recurrence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery artifacts decoding intentions via threads transforms supernatural trope through tactile, intuitive method; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in charged CR without gimmickry.</comment>
