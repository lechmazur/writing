<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in quest for connection, rooted in questioning sounds/memories, but interiority leans abstract with unearned epiphanies like "propel herself into deeper understanding"; lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as tension between gentle touch and transformative power. No embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure beyond placement of lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to lens activation/resonance, culminating in CR closure via final realization ("every object...contained stories") with felt cost of ongoing pilgrimage amid waning light. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no causality breaks, one tightening via awakened miners' song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust motes as spirits, lens glow, humming resonance) filter through POV priorities, with lab and lens constraining actions (resonator placement) and charging closure image (lens humming as testament). Golden shadows motif evolves, mirroring internal revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover connection via sound) signaled early, tightens texturally via lens resonance revealing miners' voices, narrowing to deeper understanding with cost of endless questioning. Pressure coherent but internal/low external; agency in activation/ listening forecloses silence assumption on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sound/memory/connection emerges organically from lens experiment and questions ("cacophony...melodies?"), resonating in final image without moralizing; subtext in objects as "vessels of experience" reweights assumptions non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical texture suited to acoustic quest; perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing (harmonies silenced, lens vibration); rhythmic prose modulates from setup to resonant close, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("artificial pilgrimage," "texture of connection," "powerfully gentle," "questioning assumptions") create paraphrase churn across paragraphs, dulling density; some overwriting in stacked abstractions dulls closure hum image, though rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic archaeology transforms memory tropes via lens resurrection of miners' song; risk in lyric object-revelation structure heightens resonance, inevitable in hindsight from lab premise without gimmickry.</comment>
