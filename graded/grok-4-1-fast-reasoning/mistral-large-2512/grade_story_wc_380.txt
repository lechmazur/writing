<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via coffee grounds and journal ties motives to embodied contradiction (forget vs. pursue echoes); final step forward earned as renunciation of forgetting with flowers' fall as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as spiral patterns deepen from grounds to journal to gravity pull; charged poise closure reconfigures memories as echoes with undeniable pull-cost in final step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystals and gravity constrain final choice, pulling boots; sensory ozone/tremble filter through lantern lighter's priorities, charging refracted beams image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (echoes/sister) tightens via journal reveal under accumulative lens; agency in exhuming forces stance crystallization with gravity cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent echoes emerges organically from spirals/journal; final answering reweights deletion premise without moralizing, lingering via whale song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature fixates on patterns/light/salt; rhythmic prose modulates from heavy flame to searching beams under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "boots slid an inch"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "scattered stars" enhance peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whale-as-vessel with gravity pockets transforms memory-loss trope into fresh speculative synthesis; risk in abstract physics paid off via tactile pull and echo premise.</comment>
