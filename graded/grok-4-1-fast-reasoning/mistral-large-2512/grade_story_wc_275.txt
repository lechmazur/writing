<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and contradictory impulses in Liora's pacifism vs. survival training, earned by gestures like sheathing the knife; relationship crucible forces father's flicker without tidy resolution. Father's traits shown through jaw tightening and rose-holding hesitation. Minor slip in told "senselessly perceptive nature" lacks embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from soil work to confrontation, tightening via sandbag/rose exchanges to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early in dome farm post-tower. Cost legible in "the rose wilting slightly in his grip" and unclaimed bounty, reconfiguring continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome and roses vividly selective, mirroring defiance ("blooms in defiance of the arid world"); constrains by sealing humid warmth vs. howling wind outside. Charges final image of soil-cradled fingers. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward patterns and petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bounty) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through gestures narrowing violence option; agency in rose-giving forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in wilting petals and foreclosed claim. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges organically from roses-in-cracks image shifting to father's hand; subtext in silences and thorns. Resonant non-literal close in "life persisted," reweighting survival without moral. Avoids binaries via ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing curls, scents); voice rhythmic and biased toward patterns ("velvety petals," "threads"). Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("too soft"); natural distinction. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "tranquil blazes" taught early. Minor overwriting in opening stacked figs ("fracturing...blazes") but coherent. No loops; propulsion weaves action/thought cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower dome-farm refuge and plant-inculcating pacifism transforms bounty trope. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes via rose motif without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight from particulars.</comment>
