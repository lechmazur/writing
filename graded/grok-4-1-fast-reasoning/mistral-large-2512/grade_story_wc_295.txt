<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (trembling fingers, clenched fists); contradictory impulses act in realization scene ("too focused on decoding to see the truth"); final stance shift to communal sharing earned by dream accumulation with visible cost in renunciation of solitary role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream density builds to CR closure ("inscriptions weren’t a puzzle... invitation") with felt cost in foreclosed solitary path; orientation anchored early (observatory, midnight); one tightening via witness shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome groaning, clock chiming, eyepiece constrain perception and charge final image (dome creaks, stars wheel as he stands); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (cosmic whispers); observatory mirrors internal alignment without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode dreams/inscriptions) signaled early, tightens via agency in realization (eyes closed as witness), foreclosing decoder path; cost legible in "hollow" words now shared aloud; lens-consistent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shared burdens emerges organically from dream particulars and inscriptions, reweighted in final image ("burden... not alone"); resonant non-literal answer via invitation motif; complexity in communal promise avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (cosmic/dream filters); diction/rhythm modulates from insistent to resolute ("stars wheeling"); purposeful compression in reflection anchors to cues like telegram.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid longer builds); no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (daylily bloom/reverse); propulsion peaks cleanly at standing decision without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh chronicler-of-dreams frame transforms star/temple tropes via shared inscription twist; risk in accumulative realization feels inevitable; particular details (lucid visions, writhing symbols) anchor originality.</comment>
