<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's copper-tasting lie and arrow-tip thumbing embody defiant curiosity under workshop-death pressure; Veyra's warnings force micro-choice persistence; final smile earns defiance without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of groans, rising acid, gear fits builds to CR closure—"it heard us" reconfigures unheard bell with teeth-aching resonance cost; orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid fumes and groaning hull constrain final gear fit, mirror internal yearning, charge closure as workshop's voice; selective sensory hierarchy (fumes curling, gears halting) reflects Elias's gear-language bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ring bell before workshop dies—tightens accumulatively as gears halt and sea rises, forcing cord-pull agency; cost legible in dying workshop persisting post-echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yearning-to-resonance theme emerges from schematics, bell-groan, felt-echo without statement; final image non-literally answers "point of unheard bell?" via conceptual payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (gears as language, acid tastes) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual ("Fools ring bells") pursues goals; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm under rush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image (fumes curling, hum vibrating bones); minor scaffold in "*throughout the evolution*" and "*steadily curious*" jars register slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh yearning-algorithm synthesis transforms steampunk tropes via acid-sea defiance and talismanic arrow; risk in irreverent bell-obsession heightens stakes organically.</comment>
