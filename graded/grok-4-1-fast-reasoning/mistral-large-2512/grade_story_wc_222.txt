<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lirien's embodied reactions (breath fogging, pulse quickening) and micro-choices (placing pawn then rook) reveal contradictory impulses toward wonder and caution, earning the final realization as credible endurance with cost in miscalculation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via secret density building to CR closure in "the lid grew warm... What did it mean," reweighting relic quest with conceptual cost of the unknown embracing her; orientation anchors early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost-slicked steps and whispering winds constrain climb and trade, with wrong sky pulsing to charge final image; sensory details (frigid air, cracking ice voice) filter through Lirien's priorities without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relic for wonder) signaled early tightens accumulatively through trades and "not clever enough" reversal, narrowing options with agency in piece placement; cost legible in guardian's laughter echoing post-win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing unknown emerges organically from amended mentor words to final question, resonant non-literal answer in wind as "invitation" reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (cosmic joke energy, chess vessels) modulates rhythm under stress; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("A trade," "Clever thief"), advances plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences in tension ("Lirien froze"); high density integrates action/image without loops or muddled metaphors, though minor overwrought "wrongness of the sky" in opener.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chivalrous thief trading hollow chess secrets amid fractured sky transforms tropes; final reconfiguration (relic to thrill) feels inevitable from established pattern, bold risk in guardian's playful yield.</comment>
