<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (dramatic stars vs. quiet dust persistence) compel the final stance shift; micro-choices like tracing and sketching reveal values under post-flood pressure. Minor epiphanic polish in "humbling" line borders unearned but stays grounded in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through dust observations to CR closure ("This was her new research"); cost legible in final notebook sketch reconfiguring cosmic focus to humility, with warped pages as felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring dust and damp workbench constrain observations/choices, charging final sketch image; sensory details (grit under glove, creaking glass) selectively mirror internal shift, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasping gradual influence) tightens accumulatively via microscope reveal and breath-disturbing particles, narrowing to endurance of quiet proof; agency in sustained attention forecloses dramatic pursuits with conceptual cost at close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of small-scale gravity emerges organically from dust-stars parallels, reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonance in dust's persistence offers non-literal answer to drama vs. humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (scientific gaze poeticized via "constellations of decay"); rhythmic modulation builds quiet intensity, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "dust" recurrence; varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor paraphrase in reflection beats ("slow accumulation," "quiet proof") nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars and butterfly dust in ruined greenhouse transforms epiphany trope; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes via fragile persistence without gimmick.</comment>
