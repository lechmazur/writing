<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied skepticism warring with evidence culminate in earned reconfiguration at "the weight of his skepticism dissolve"; reflective blocks anchor present choices without flattening pressure. Minor tidy progression in emotional arc prevents 9+ as impulses feel layered but not fully contradictory in peak mortar moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from path to tower interior realization; on-page CR closure via amber placement reconfigures premise with legible cost of dissolved skepticism. Orientation anchored immediately at tower base; no shards or transitions violate single-scene default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "slick with moss" and "dusty footprints" filter through Elias's priorities, constraining path choices; tower vials and open roof charge final dawn image as crucible. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of skepticism vs. pilgrimage truth signaled early tightens accumulatively through Liora's vial reveal and amber catalyst; agency in hesitation and placement forecloses disbelief path with felt cost. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility, but lacks micro-turn reversal for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as chemical reaction emerges organically from particulars like amber and vials, resonating in final "binding of the self" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question; quiet CR reweights premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in skeptic's precise observations; rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure prose. Dialogue natural, subtextual ("It is, but not in the way we thought"), distinguishing voices without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—e.g., "paradox he couldn’t ignore" integrates seamlessly. Opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-contact pilgrimage as alchemy transforms tropes organically; risk in chemical metaphor payoff feels inevitable from amber seed. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity commits fully without retreat.</comment>
