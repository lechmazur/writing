<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to recover unsaid love via psychometry is rooted in grandmother's training and shown through persistent micro-choices like tracing perforations; embodied emotions build in chest tightening and breath bursts. Internal drive lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax vision, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory buildup (scent, touch, hum) holds to Charged Poise closure: projector activates, lyrics appear with film-blackening cost legible in "edges blackening as if singed." Single scene oriented by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Projection booth as liminal "space where time stretched thin" constrains her incubation tactic and charges final projector whir; sensory details (celluloid/dust scent, brittle film) filter through Mira's spatial bias, mirroring visions without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (film strip) evolves tactilely to singe in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover tune/letters in unused love storage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pressure buildup (warmth → vision → booth tremble → projector life), narrowing to her promise-fulfilling smile; film damage shows visible cost, but lacks protagonist-forced trade-off in final beat under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid emotions/songs stored in liminal spaces emerges organically from visions and pool "like liquid silver"; final projector image reconfigures premise with non-literal resonance ("The song had been here all along"), lingering ambiguity on cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (hollows, gaps, pressure as breath); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed to "hushed thunder" under vision stress, diction biased toward spatial metaphors; no head-hopping, purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "film strip warmed... like the weight of a held breath" advances sensation/plot); metaphors consistent in textural logic without muddle, rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor density slip in reflective opener slightly dulls early momentum, but closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on film reel to access unsent love storage transforms trope into spatial "cavity behind the screen"; risk-taking in surreal payoff (wet-ink pen from vision) heightens conceptual stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
