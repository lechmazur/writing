<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Characterization strong in embodied hesitation and micro-choices like Mira tracing the doodles, revealing guarded natures; mutual thaw earned through prior secrecy. Minor slip in stock "pulse quickened" and told irony ("irony wasn’t lost on her") dilutes peak embodiment without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density from confrontation to ticket-map display, yielding Charged Poise closure ("let’s start over") with relational cost legible in slotted lens. Orientation anchored early (Mira's entry by ~50 words); single scene causality tight, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "scent of old celluloid and rain" and projector hum filter through Mira's registrar priorities, evolving with action; lens as recurring object constrains initial conflict and charges final image (projector whirs to life).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant mistrust stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elias's doodle-map reveal narrowing trust options; agency in Mira's lens-handling forecloses pretense with felt relational cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty thawing secrets emerges organically from ticket confessions and final lens-slotting, resonating in "silence...felt like a beginning" without moralizing; subtext in silences and gestures enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mira's perceptual bias (shadow → tucked ticket); dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You’re lying"), distinct voices (Elias's shaky breath vs. Mira's whisper). Rhythmic modulation under pressure clean, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shadow moved...tucked the ticket"); rhythm varies, syntax propels via short peaks ("You’re lying."). Minor paraphrase loop in silence motifs ("silence felt heavier...fracture in the silence") dings without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cinema micro-world secrets via eavesdropped doodle-map transforms workplace trope; risk in quiet relational pivot feels earned, inevitable in hindsight from hoarded archives motif.</comment>
