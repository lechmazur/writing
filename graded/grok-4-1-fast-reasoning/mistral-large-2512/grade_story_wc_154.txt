<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (flexes fingers as drugs blur edges) and contradictory impulses (itches to scratch despite pain, leans despite evacuation ban); earned shift to connection via coral's heat. Minor slip in reflective summary ("lotus-hearted ache") borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coral pulse to aligned casts glowing "Home" as Charged Poise RR with felt grief cost in final shared smile. Orientation anchored early (atrium, post-strike cast); single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and balustrade constrain choice (press casts to align notes); twilight light charges coral edges and final glow image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (translator traces fractal patterns, smudged languages); evolves causally with wind swirl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unknot fear via coral connection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to boy-mirror reversal narrowing isolation; agency in crouch/press forecloses solitude with grief cost legible in "softening the edges of their shared grief."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting meaning onto wounds emerges organically via coral/casts; final "Home" glow reweights anxieties without moral, resonant via particulars. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers in hallucination doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with translator's perceptual signature (patterns as languages, scars fractal); rhythmic prose modulates haze (thoughts "slippery") without head-hopping. Lyrical diction purposeful, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in peak: "The boy’s lips parted."); no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("palimpsest," "siren’s song") coherent but borders overwrite in opening without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: living coral as anxiety cipher linking casts in war ruin transforms tropes; "notes began to glow... Home" turn inevitable from particulars, risks lyric mode payoff.</comment>
