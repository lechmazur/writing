<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's mnemonic gift and suppressed creativity root clear motivation that intensifies through sketches and dream, compelling the final step with earned closure. Interiority embodies via charcoal hands and popping knees. Minor slip: internal conflict summarizes isolation rather than showing simultaneous impulses in pivotal lock-turning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lock discovery → dream → sketches → painting peel → door opens as DC with trembling hands as felt cost in final image. Orientation anchors artist/cave by para 1. Single scene + dream shard fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave pulses violet, constraining sketches and hiding painting/door to charge climax; dust, detritus, brass lock tactilely lived-in. Sensory hierarchy via artist's priorities (hollow cheeks, humming lock). Cave breathes/mirrors calling, evolving to golden burst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer calling, rectify lock) signaled early, tightens via dream knowledge change narrowing to painting method; agency in turning dial forecloses isolation with legible emotional cost in trembling step. Causal lens escalation coherent, one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creativity uncorking lost souls emerges via lock/laughter/painting particulars, reweighted in golden light bringing faces home without moral state. Subtext in joy-without-body tensions isolation. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to calling's pull.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (charcoal ghosts, pulsing walls). Prose texture lyrical yet controlled, rhythm modulates to urgent dial-turn. No dialogue; elision of door source builds legitimately to payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax in peak beats (e.g., "The laughter poured out like honey"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene. Minor register elevation in "cathedral of amethyst" purposeful for voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Broken lock as calling's anchor transforms artist-haunted-trope into fresh mnemonic rectification arc. Risky dream-painting hinge feels inevitable, synthesis of cave/creativity bold without gimmick.</comment>
