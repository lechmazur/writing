<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied grief (tracing ring, "wound he couldn’t stop picking at") and earned change (pressing stencil to wrist forecloses drowning), with contradictory impulses in opening door despite reluctance; backstory anchors tightly to present tools without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via origami pattern taught early (~first 10%), legible shard transitions via coordinates, closure as Charged Poise RR in stellar vision and exhale ("weight...loosening") with legible emotional cost; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective details (painted crimson petals, whispering books) filter through Elias's grief-biased lens, constrain path (coordinates to corners), charge final dome image; observatory recurs to frame return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant grief stake signaled early (rock bottom, Liora's tools), Accumulative escalation via accumulating shards narrows to vision's deepening, agency in following trail/climbing/presses stencil forecloses path with chest-loosening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief's wither-to-bloom emerges organically from trail's particulars, final image (Liora's face, pressing thorns) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting vine motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("curtains of intention," lavender-scented figures); rhythmic control modulates from heavy dust motes to chime-alive release; child's brief dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "thorned vine curling around the name *Liora*"), varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (wither/bloom); zero loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in telescope beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami scavenger hunt in decayed city yielding stellar grief-lesson; transforms mourning tropes via "genuinely artificial" details and mosaic risk heightening accumulative stakes.</comment>
