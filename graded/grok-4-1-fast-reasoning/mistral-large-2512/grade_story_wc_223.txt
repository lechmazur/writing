<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in crisis actor's bleed between script and reality; final renunciation of pawn role earned via unscripted speech and joint walk, with embodied cost in kneeling on chessboard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from footsteps to shared walk; CR closure in leaving chessboard reconfigures stance from scripted pawn to historian, cost legible in "pawnless squares a testament."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Whispering gallery acoustics constrain voice and footsteps, charging final image; recurring chessboard absence mirrors internal states and evolution, with sensory echoes amplifying hesitations purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unbinding tightens via man's intervention and shared walk under Accumulative lens; agency in "teach me" and leaving board forecloses scripted path with felt absence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures vs. grand history emerges organically through footsteps, speech, and chessboard; resonant CR ending reweights premise without moral, via "stories that had been unbound."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature in biased noticing of echoes/absences; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You're doing it wrong"), with clean third-close stability and rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative consistency (smoke curls, cracked egg); varied rhythm propels without loops, clarity intact in peak "luminous absence" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor in penumbra with luminous historian arc; risk-taking in lyric walking patterns heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pawnless board closure.</comment>
