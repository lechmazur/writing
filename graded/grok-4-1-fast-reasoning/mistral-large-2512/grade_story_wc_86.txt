<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to recycle mistakes concretely embodied in drawer pull handling; contradictory endurance of burden vs. untethering fantasy acts in scene. Seris's thoughtfulness forces micro-choice in correction. Final renunciation earned via prior reflections anchored to present exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build to charged poise closure; conceptual repricing of mistakes as wisdom legible in "warm in his pocket" image with carried weight cost. Orientation anchored in opening line. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet constrains choices via slickness/exposure; mist/sea evolve to mirror silence, charging final image. Sensory selection (salt, wind howl) POV-filtered for urgency. Micro-setting as recurring object (stones) integrates fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exchange signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dawn pressure and touch reversal narrowing relational options. Brief contact burns as felt cost altering poise. Agency in proof handover coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from regret emerges organically via drawer pull/locket reprise shifting meaning. Final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silence between apology/forgiveness lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mist-filtered noticing; voice rhythm modulates from rough speech to hushed cadence under tension. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Clever"/"Thoughtful"), advances with goal pursuit. Stable single POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short wind sentences propel, long reflections breathe). No loops/artifacts; precise diction like "tarnished green" textural. Final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic exchange as personal wisdom carriers transforms negotiation trope. Drawer pull/locket moon phases inflect stakes organically. Bold quiet risk in hushed poise heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
