<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's claustrophobia and doll-clutching create embodied contradiction, culminating in earned nod to "next time" that forecloses bunker stasis with relational possibility. Boy's recognition adds crucible pressure without overwhelming. Doll exchange reveals hierarchy of values (safety vs. agency). Minor slip: boy's depth emerges too swiftly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via silence densities to Charged Poise closure: final nod reconfigures bunker limits with "next time" promise, cost felt in "walls still pressing in." Orientation anchored by trellis step (~50 words). One tightening at doll reversal suffices. Lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trellis vines constrain steps and sway choices; doll as micro-setting charges tactile weight in pocket through climb. Sensory hierarchy (ozone silence, spongy feet) biases via Liora's bunker lens. Final sway mirrors internal reconfiguration. Inverted clouds lit from below evolve with gravity shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bunker crush vs. silence collection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at boy encounter narrowing isolation to shared recognition. Cost legible in doll's growing heaviness and gravity's inch-by-inch return foreclosing ascent. Agency in steps and exchange drives under textural lens. No reversal overload needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Doll motif shifts from maternal ghost to Liora's charge, resonating theme of inverted safety amid silence flavors without statement. Boy's line reweights premise organically. Final image answers risk-reward ambiguity via Charged Poise. Emerges from particulars, invites rereading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("silences... parsing the hollow echo") stable in close third; dialogue subtextual ("neither are you") pursues recognition goal. Rhythm modulates from syrupy whispers to swaying creak. No head-hopping; diction biased to tastes/textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; rhythm varies (short creak sentences amid lyrical stretches). Minor figurative density ("ribs of some great slumbering beast," "honey left too long") taught early without muddle. No loops; purposeful silence recurrences pattern-taught. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inverted-gravity trellis and silence-tasting synthesize fresh frame; doll twist transforms abandonment trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via xenial mystery. Premise implications (sprouted bridge) followed to possibility's cost without retreat.</comment>
