<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (cold calculus vs. trembling mercy) act in the mirror chamber, earning the final renunciation of forgetting with embodied cost; Mara's pressure reveals his flaws through micro-choices like choosing left.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glow density and memory fragments tighten to CR closure in mirrors—"the only way out was to look"—with conceptual cost of facing stains; orientation anchored early at lake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake glow evolves to constrain path and charge mirrors, mirroring internal states through tactile lapping and intensifying pulse; recurring object (baseball warms) functions as micro-setting for final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reason to persist amid lost empathy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via left choice narrowing to mirror confrontation; agency in hesitation forecloses cold path with felt memory cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable past emerges organically from lake glow to mirror memories, reweighting premise in final CR image without moralizing; subtext in baseball's warning charges renunciation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (parsing lines like old codes); dialogue subtextual—Mara's "look that says you’ve done things you can’t undo"—pursues status shift naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax, but simile stacks like "blade forged to bend but never break" slightly over-write high-pressure intro; no loops, high density integrates memory into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Time-traveler baseball transforms maze trope into personal mirror test; fresh synthesis of jaded seeker and glowing underground feels inevitable in hindsight, risking quiet CR over action climax.</comment>
