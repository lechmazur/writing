<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of dual allegiance act in scene through sabotage tactics while bridging outsiders; final belief earned by causal buildup of micro-choices, with burden as felt cost peaking in "weight of dual allegiance still pressed on her chest."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of resistance patterns tightening to vote night; on-page Charged Poise closure ("for the first time, Lan believed it") reconfigures allegiance burden with legible emotional cost, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city's drifting planks and graffiti undersides constrain sabotage choices (blocking paths, hull scrawls); foundation stone charges final palm-press image, sensory details (groaning wood, sticky floss) mirror internal chaos via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Vey/deeds from gentrification) signaled early, accumulatively deepens via agency-driven reorganizations narrowing options to endurance; visible cost in allegiance weight charges vote-night poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen resilience emerges organically from graffiti counters and small sabotages; final image/words ("The raft survives because we choose it") offer non-literal reconfiguration of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature filters carnival chaos through Lan's pattern-seeing bias; Vey's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances closure; rhythm modulates from revelry blur to taut edge-standing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "vultures," "second skin") woven into action; varied rhythm propels to charged end without loops or scaffolds, minor density in opening backstory integrated cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-carnival gentrification via graffiti codes and intuitive sabotage transforms tropes; risk in paradoxical traits heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
