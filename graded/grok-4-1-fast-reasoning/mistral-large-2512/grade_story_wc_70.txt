<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's truthful curse creates subtle internal tension when speaking to Maren ("words tasted like ash"), constraining evasion but not driving a pivotal contradictory impulse or high-cost choice. Motivation to preserve wonder feels told via reflection rather than fully embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Solid individual traits and endurance at closure, but lacks 9+ scene-acting contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from box discovery to match strike reviving hives (DC closure). Orientation anchored early at tower base post-blackout. One tightening via tower entry and core reveal suffices; cost legible in sabotage murmur and foreclosed dreams at "hives rise into the twilight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower as micro-setting constrains choices (off-limits entry, core interaction) and charges final image (lightning arcing out). Sensory details like "ozone and burnt sugar" and "nectar dusk" filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with action. Environment shapes climax without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save hives/wonder) signaled early, tightens causally via riddle reveal and sabotage knowledge, narrowing to match strike with agency. Escalation driven by Maren's pressure and tower hum; cost felt in wilting gardens/children's lost magic, charging end without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges organically from riddle, hives, and tower's "memory," reweighted at closure without statement. Final image of revived hives offers resonant non-literal answer to routine vs magic. Subtext in sabotage lingers with ambiguity, avoiding tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in poetic filters like "secret begging to be kept." Dialogue natural/subtextual (Maren's "holding it wrong" advances plot). Rhythm modulates under stress; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figures like "blue flame" propel without muddle. Propulsion clear in peak match strike; minor overwriting in openings doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning tower, drone hives, riddle matchbox transforms tropes into organic world/logic. Risky poetic tone heightens ingenuity; turn at paper-rearranging riddle feels inevitable from setup.</comment>
