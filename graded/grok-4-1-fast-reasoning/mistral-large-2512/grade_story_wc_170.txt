<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority ("thrummed beneath her ribs like a borrowed heartbeat") and micro-choices in painting reveal values under watchman's pressure; final belief shift earned via prior causality. Minor slip: watchman's generic chuckle and query dilute secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory/memory density builds to Charged Poise closure ("she didn’t just see the mirage. She believed in it"), with legible cost in her isolation as "last who remembered." Orientation anchored early (terrace, painting mirage); one tightening via bells sharpens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains painting (rainbows "bled into the stone") and charges final image (mirrors ripple); sensory hierarchy (jasmine, damp earth) reflects Liora's priorities without catalog. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remind mirrors via painting) signaled early, escalates accumulatively with watchman interruption and bells forcing faster strokes; agency in humming/breathing lullabies narrows to belief with felt endurance cost. Minor abstractness in stakes before bells slightly dulls visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory/grace coaxing unseen emerges organically via lullabies/painting, resonant in final image reweighting seeing-to-believing without moralizing. Subtext in watchman's blindness adds irony; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("facets catching the dying light") stable in close third; dialogue subtextual (watchman listens to bells, she to hush) advances stakes naturally. Rhythmic control modulates to fluid intensity at climax; elision of mirage mechanics taught early, paid in belief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("rainbows bled into the stone") taught early without muddle; rhythm varies to propel (short sentences at bells). Minor paraphrase loop in "borrowed heartbeat" echoes, but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (lullabies coding grace, prism-mirrors persuaded by paint) transforms mirage trope via lived memory; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at "mirrors of the world shift."</comment>
