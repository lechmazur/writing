<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shines in embodied details like tracing scars and ledger ink, revealing adaptive traits through micro-choices under pressure; contradictory impulses emerge in her pursuit despite fear, earning the final stance shift. Jaren applies targeted pressure via guilt-fear mask and admission, forcing her reconfiguration. Minor label-speak ("steadily adaptive") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via frost-ledges-ledger pattern buildup, holding to Charged Poise closure where folding the strip reconfigures fire as "beginning" with conceptual cost of expanded threat. Orientation anchors by para 2 (canyon, Liora post-fire). Single scene causality tightens via frost alignment to Jaren confrontation; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns and creek constrain path to Jaren, charging final ledger pocket image; canyon silence heightens perceptual narrowing under night stars. Sensory hierarchy (cold water, crunching boots, smoke scent) filters via artist's eye, mirroring internal ash-to-purpose shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (glass beads, ledger) integrates tactilely into choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fire's why/purpose) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via frost-map revelation to Jaren's "burn the whole canyon" admission, narrowing to canyon-as-choice with felt cost in slumping resolve and pocketed weight. Agency in ledger confrontation forces trade-off; one tightening suffices, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of purpose-in-pauses emerges organically from ash-fire, frost-ledger patterns, reweighted in final "canyon... also a choice" without moralizing. Subtext layers via silences (Jaren's flick-away gaze) and images (frost as earth-clues); invites ambiguity on adaptive cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from reshaping loss into charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with artist's perceptual bias (light-catching beads, ink traces); voice texture lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm from quiet hum to sharp exhale. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("That’s not yours" evades via mutter); no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge (recognizes Jaren hunch).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "frost-kissed stones" evokes setting/action/omen); varied rhythm passes ear test, syntax breathes with tension peaks. Minor paraphrase loops ("quiet" motif purposeful but borders redundancy; "patterns" thrice close). No filter stacks or muddled figs in closure; clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost-as-map aligns ledger smuggling with artist's light-shaping past, transforming fire trope into canyon-scale threat via adaptive pursuit. Risk in quiet poise ending heightens resonance; no template echoes, particulars (beads, kiln husk) anchor ingenuity.</comment>
