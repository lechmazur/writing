<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's sentimentalism embodied in gear bite and trembling fingers compels pressing it despite Kael's warning; relationship crucible forces pattern break with Kael's wonder as payoff. Backstory anchors tilt present choice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (petals, light, pings) tightening to Charged Poise closure: nebula swallows ships with lingering light as felt cost of partial cycle break. Orientation anchored early in nebula viewport; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains via responsive petals sharpening to sonar/gear, charging final image; sensory selection (shiver, glow, thrum) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break cycle via light-sharing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as gear pings disarm Kael, forcing acceptance with relational cost legible in powered-down ship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Light vs. fire reconfigures cycles through particulars (gear transmission, petal memory); final image resonates non-literally as "cycle wasn’t broken...felt like it could be" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cosmic-sentimental idiom (petals as "frozen moment," "quiet sigh"); dialogue subtextual (Kael's rage yields wonder), natural under comms static; stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short pings amid lyrical swells); minor petal paraphrase loops purposeful for texture, not obscuring cause (sonar→glow→disarm).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nebula-as-library and gear-transmission transforms generational tropes; risk in quiet serenity amid conflict heightens stakes organically.</comment>
