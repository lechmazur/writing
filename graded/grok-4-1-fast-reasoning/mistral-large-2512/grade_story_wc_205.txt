<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reimagine the civilization drives consistent traits and intensifies to the ritual choice with embodied cost (slumped, shallow breath). Contradictory impulses act in scene via dialogue with Liora and the final endurance. Minor slip in performed emotions ("burnished sorrow") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from setup to ritual climax; closure as Conceptual Repricing via mirrors unfolding verse with Elias's felt physical cost on page ("slumped against the wall, ... breath shallow"). Orientation anchored early (Elias in Obsidian Archive on asteroid). One meaningful tightening in the shard-mirror ritual narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring mirrors constrain choice (left uncovered for ritual) and charge final image (shimmer, ripple, then blank). Temporal storm and shard light integrate tactilely into action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's poetic bias over Core precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine vs. erase) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual amid storm forcing endurance. Agency in devising/positioning shard narrows options with visible cost (exhaustion at dawn). Liora's pressure coheres without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sentiment restoring voice emerges implicitly from dispute and ritual, reweighted in final image ("gave them back their voice") without moralizing. Shard shifts from relic to catalyst, charging closure non-literally. Complex ambiguity lingers in Liora's whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (poetic fracturing of light, time threads). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("erasing it" vs. "remind us why"). Rhythmic modulation under storm pressure; voices distinct (Elias poetic, Liora sharp).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density in opening ("gilded relic ... ribs of some great beast") borders overwriting without obscuring closure. Minor template stems in reflection ("didn’t understand," "didn’t see"). Propulsion clear; no loops dulling ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, mirror traps, poetic ritual transforms archaeology trope organically. Risk in baroque sci-fi voice heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from shard-seed.</comment>
