<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict peaks in the final beat—"He could step forward now... What if she called security?"—where contradictory impulses (reveal vs. hide) act simultaneously, earning the endurance of hiding through prior isolation costs and methodical traits. Sense memory of mother anchors emotion concretely without therapy-speak. Flaw of self-imposed invisibility complicates the Voss quest organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tape fragment motivates cache retrieval, outage provides cover, creaks force hiding (because/therefore). Charged Poise closure crystallizes reveal/hide options with legible cost ("ache for things you could never have again") in final image of closed eyes as light sweeps. Orientation anchored early (vents, east wing by para 1). One tightening sufficient; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vent grates, loose floorboard, flickering emergency lights constrain choices (hiding spots, cache access) and charge final beat. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: lemon oil smell triggers memory amid crisis-narrowed sight (light beams, shadows). Atmosphere mirrors isolation (stuttering lights as heartbeat). Evolving details (plunged darkness, swirling dust) integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Voss/seek visibility) tightens via creaks narrowing options to reveal/hide, forcing endurance with isolation cost felt in "sense memories... made you ache." Protagonist agency in ducking/hiding tests commitment. Escalation coherent under causal lens; one reversal (interruption) forecloses easy secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths/visibility emerges implicitly from Voss scraps, tape desperation, and final poise (isolation vs. Mara reveal). Sense memory image shifts from ache to potential bridge. Closing eyes reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on endurance cost. No tidy resolution; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable, perceptual signature biased to shadows/smells (e.g., "scent triggering... mother's hands"). Rhythm modulates with stress: short sentences in creak beats ("A floorboard creaked... He froze."). No head-hopping; single "Hello?" natural/subtextual. Diction matches isolated archivist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "lights flickered... plunged into darkness" advances tension/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; read-aloud propulsive. Minor telling in Voss backstory integrates via present cue (tape label). Zero filter stacks or muddled figures in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crawl-space dweller + Voss tape synthesis fresh, transforming "hidden library figure" trope via methodical Voss hunt. Final poise turn inevitable from isolation buildup. Bold risk in quiet non-resolution heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
