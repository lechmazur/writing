<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in concrete images like "tracing its frayed edges in the dust," rooting his curse-driven motivation; final choice to embed messages earns his shift from seeker to keeper. Minor flaw: epiphanic summary in "Elias understood then" slightly abstracts the dream's pivot over embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds perfectly through shard discoveries (urn, key, dream), tightening to Conceptual Repricing closure where "time...as a circle" reweights premise with "weight of borrowed time" cost legible in final chest image; orientation anchors instantly in silo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo as micro-setting constrains choices (returns for vision, writing) and charges closure; sensory selectivity (ticking, hum, rain scent) reflects timekeeper bias. Garage sales integrate purposefully without catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover time's texture) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening discoveries narrowing to agency in writing tag; cost felt in "weight...in his chest," forcing stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical time emerges organically from particulars (poetic tags, dream woman); final image of writing "For the one who arrives too soon" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting linear premise, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with distinct perceptual signature (time as "sand," "honey," "frayed edges"); rhythmic control modulates from introspective to charged in dream and closure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "The fragment hummed...whispering"); metaphors consistent (ice, embers) without muddle; varied rhythm, zero loops, though minor overwriting in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garage sale tags transform time-bending trope into fresh breadcrumb method, synthesizing relics and messages organically; risk of lyric circularity pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, no template echoes.</comment>
