<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's hesitation ("What if I forget the words?") reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning her singing choice with embodied cost (throat raw). Keeper applies pressure via seed and guidance. Minor archetypal simplicity in traits slightly limits distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (vines, fruit, songs) builds to Charged Poise closure as dawn creeps with "work... not done," legible cost in fragile light and raw throat. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via seed-planting-singing progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mica windows recur to charge final image ("mica windows of the village began to glow"), constraining memory via greenhouse's refracting light mirroring dawn's return. Sensory details (scent of overripe fruit, vines coiling) filter through Elara's purpose, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle dawns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as Elara doubts then sings, forcing community involvement with visible cost (throat raw, unending work). Agency in planting/singing forecloses forgetting path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-threads emerges organically from particulars (fruit dawns, silver seed), resonant in final "threads... rewoven... one song at a time" reweighting endless night without moralizing. Keeper's dissolve adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow biases; voice lyrical yet controlled ("voice like wind through dry leaves"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (keeper's "You must remember"); rhythm modulates to swell at song climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful lyricism ("branches heavy with fruit that shimmered like liquid gold") propels without loops. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical fantasy (dawns as fruit/seeds woven by songs) transforms tropes organically; final watcher image risks quiet poise successfully, heightening stakes via fragile return (+0.3 risk).</comment>
