<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing carvings and matching pulse; ethically playful trait enables risk via grinning loop of rope. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("impossible choice... fear and surrender") feels slightly unearned at climax, but final pull shows contradictory impulses acting with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from curiosity to visions via pattern-following. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (grotto, Lirien, post-energy beings). Closure as CR lands on-page in "falling—not through space, but through time" with felt cost of surrender; rope constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (amber glow, pulsing walls like heartbeat) filters through poetic POV; grotto constrains via stalagmite tie and eruption at pull. Terra-cotta evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, charging final limp-rope image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of time) signaled early, tightens texturally via rhythm-matching and rope-tie deepening knowledge/options. Agency in pull forecloses inaction with cost (stars blink, trembling); pressure coheres to Charged Poise in visions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time as alive illusion emerges organically from visions looping prisoner/present; final limp-rope image reconfigures premise non-literally with conceptual cost of illusion confrontation. No moralizing; subtext in rope's "ghost" history enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with poetic perceptual signature (time as "fabric," "lover’s skin"); diction/rhythm modulates intensity at pull ("grotto erupted in light"). No head-hopping or elision; voice particular to drifting poet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors purposeful (onion layers, living time) without muddle in peak visions. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; rhythm varies, climax sharp in "rope burned cold... pages in a book."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-bending energy beings, poet-rope relic transforming escape trope into temporal key. Risk in textural visions heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, organic to voice/closure.</comment>
