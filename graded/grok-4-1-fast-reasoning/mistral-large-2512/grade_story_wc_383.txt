<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's charmed skepticism shows in doubting magic yet tracing resonance structures under humming air, earning his final "I'm not afraid anymore" with embodied throat-tightening and prior isolation cost. Liora's ghostly form forces relational crucible via mist-touch. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: garden hum, shell pattern, shimmer build density to Charged Poise closure where resonance flares weave memories, reconfiguring quarantine with Elias's change. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Cost legible in "weight...felt lighter" to "quarantine was over...because Elias had."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains via thickest roses hosting shimmer and dew-absorbed hush enabling shell-listen; petals unfold like pages charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (breath hush, arm hairs, warm shell) biases to Elias's priorities. Twilight-to-morning evolution mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover Liora from quarantined memory) deepens via shell rhythm to government revelation, narrowing skeptic isolation to acceptance agency in spoken words. Cost felt in prior walls vs. need. One tightening via shimmer suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of weaponized memories emerges via resonance archiving Liora, resonant in final weaving without statement; "thoughts could outlive their thinkers" reweights premise. Subtext in mist-touch and ghostly resolve avoids tidy moral. Final image answers isolation via listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light-bending equations and dew-thief petals; voice modulates to vibration-speaking air. Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("I'm archived...not without you") advances. Rhythmic prose fits lyrical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hairs...end" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or artifacts. Metaphors coherent (frost on glass, sunlight through stained glass). Propulsion peaks in flare-weaving closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resonance-amplified thoughts as quarantined weapon transforms ghost-sister trope via specific shell/structures logic. Risky metaphorical quarantine endgame heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
