<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cool-headed trait shines in steady breath amid sky chaos and garden dissonance, with micro-choices like zigzag walk and spike offering revealing values under pressure. Interiority concrete via bone-vibrations and reed-touch grief. Final voicing earned by prior chasing years, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: garden dissonance builds density to silence void, yielding echo RR/Charged Poise when spike warms and stars pause—"He had caught the echo. Or perhaps it had caught him." Cost legible in possessive ambiguity; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden and black sand shore constrain zigzag path and reed-guidance; recurring spike charges final warm-hand image. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations in bones over visuals) reflects fisher urgency; sky chaos mirrors internal hunt purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early, escalates via sky disruption → reed shriek → ground rhythm → void under Accumulative lens, narrowing to spike-offering agency. One tightening (zigzag guided by dissonance) forecloses straight paths; cost felt in echo's possession of Kael at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of broken patterns mended through feral resonance emerges via sky unraveling → garden chaos → unified note, reweighted in final breath-holding pause without moral. Ambiguity (caught/caught him) invites reflection; spike reprise shifts from rusted omen to warm conduit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via tactile resonances ("whispering of longing...Too much"); rhythm modulates from humming reeds to bone-vibration crescendo. No head-hopping; diction purposeful, eliding mechanics for textured buildup paid at voicing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., reeds "bending...like ribs" advance setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm suits read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in garden but pattern-taught and legible; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal fisher myth—sleepwalking stars, emotion-transliterating reeds, spike-voiced silence—feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation of tropes (omens, echoes) via bone-resonance and pattern-mend originality.</comment>
