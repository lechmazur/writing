<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's meditative traits shine in carving details and patient waiting, with motivation rooting in father's memory and intensifying via ribbon guidance. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in wondering dismissal turning to acceptance. Minor slip: epiphany at poem discovery feels slightly unearned without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon discovery builds density to poem whisper and realization CR, with cost in accepting grief's bridge over solitude. One tightening at voice's poem line reconfigures knowledge. Orientation anchored early in workshop/greenhouse; closure legible with draped ribbon image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse and workshop vividly constrain: unspooling ribbon along father's path charges choices and mirrors internal states via jasmine/fireflies. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (granite smell, lavender ribbon). Final draped banner recharges butterflies/migration pattern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's shape) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via weekly returns and poem find, narrowing to collective weaving. Cost felt in foreclosing isolation. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive cadence at father's voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ribbon/poem/butterflies: grief as woven pattern/bridge. Final image resonates non-literally, reweighting solitude to connection without moralizing. Subtext in spectral whispers invites ambiguity on folklore vs. memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct reverent texture; perceptual signature in tracing fingers/sensory reverence. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise at ending whisper. No elision issues; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short breaths at poem line); no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (mist shroud, thundering calm), propelling without muddle. Closure image crisp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stone carver's reverence meets spectral ribbon in butterfly-framed grief alchemy. Transforms ghostly guidance trope via tactile weaving. Risky lyric accumulative holds stakes without gimmick.</comment>
