<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between past failures ("words always soured") and present endurance, embodied in trembling fingers and salt tears; final writing choice earned by mounting textual density. Minor epiphanic abstraction in "blossom armistice" softens peak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising image density to Charged Poise closure: pages filled, postcard softens, words carried with tear-cost legible in "ink still wet with the salt of his tears." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell's pinhole projections constrain perception (show fractured face, then dance with pen) and charge final image, mirroring internal shift; sensory selectivity (brine air, creaking bones) reflects urgency. Micro-setting as body/tool via porous walls guides escape/write choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pain-to-beauty) signaled early tightens via breeze-triggered deepening, narrowing to writing agency; cost unmistakable in tears altering postcard state under accumulative lens. One decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blossom armistice emerges organically from postcard/sister grief vs. writing beauty, resonant in final soft-edged glow reweighting premise without moral; ambiguity lingers in fragile armistice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic bias ("read them like a second language"); rhythmic control modulates from weary fracture to spiral propulsion; stable close-third POV, no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overwriting in writing beat ("spirals looping... light and shadow dancing") borders muddle without payoff, docking clarity; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-as-cathedral, galaxy postcard crossing stars, pain-photosynthesis transforms insomniac poet trope; risk in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via projections' mirror.</comment>
