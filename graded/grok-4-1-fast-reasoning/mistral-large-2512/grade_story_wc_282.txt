<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied sensory perception and fossil-clutching micro-choices reveal values under pressure, but climactic "She understood" borders unearned epiphany without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to fissure-entity merge; charged poise closure in warm fossil and "knows how to answer" lands with legible cost via shattered device and swallowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave's pulsing glow and fissure constrain choices; fossil as micro-setting charges final image, filtering through sensory-mapper bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory presence accumulates pressure, tightening from dreams to entity reach; protagonist's listening agency crystallizes stance with device-shatter cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of carrying/bridging unknown emerges via fossil reprise without statement; final image non-literally answers listening call, reweighting particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory-biased perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation sustain single POV; entity's bone-vibrating dialogue carries subtext distinct from speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful similes (light like broken glass, edges like heat haze) propels without muddle or loops; rhythm varies for mystical chamber peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory mapper becoming cave vessel synthesizes post-human mysticism freshly; fossil-world bridge transforms tropes via lived embodiment.</comment>
