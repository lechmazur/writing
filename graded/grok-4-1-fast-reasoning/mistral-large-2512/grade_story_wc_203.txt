<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's observant trait drives concrete micro-choices like dust analysis and barrel use, with embodied reactions (knees popping, pulse steady) under subtle pressure; final endurance as eternal watcher earned without tidy epiphany. Minor telling in "skillfully observant" opener slightly undercuts 9+ contradictory impulses test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to crack discovery and barrel act, delivering Charged Poise closure where fracture seals and weight lifts with ongoing vigilance cost legible in "She’d keep watching the ceilings."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective details like dust spirals, trembling cobwebs, and sawdust/caramel smell filter through Mira's priorities, constraining climax choice at ceiling fracture; micro-setting (lantern, floorboards) charges final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend time leak) signaled early tightens via dust patterns to crack reversal, forcing barrel engagement with agency; cost felt in lifted weight but persistent watch, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending world's cracks emerges organically from dust/child's laughter to sealed fracture, resonant in final vigilance image reweighting repair's partial cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing bias) and rhythmic modulation (short sentences at flicker); purposeful compression in observations pays off legibly at closure, no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., "The lantern flickered. In the sudden dimness, she saw it") propels without loops or scaffolds; purposeful figures like "dust settled like sediment" integrate cleanly, zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing repair tech and time-leak mainspring transforms circus ruin tropes; risk in conceptual "wound" payoff feels inevitable from dust patterns, heightening closure stakes.</comment>
