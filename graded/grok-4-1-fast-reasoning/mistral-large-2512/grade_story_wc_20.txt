<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief as blunt vs. her precision) act in micro-choices like staying solo and following the noise; final coin-pressing earned by prior causality with relational cost. Minor slip: epiphany on names feels slightly told rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (coin, carved name, "Forgive") densify to Charged Poise closure where Liora presses coin into Elias's palm, reconfiguring regret with legible emotional cost in "shadows seemed to sigh around them, luminous with regret, but no longer heavy."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry's tactile details (damp iron scent, sinking boots, groaning beams) constrain path through tunnels to Elias and charge final image with sighing shadows; selective sensory narrowing under urgency mirrors kintsugi cracks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand disappearance/coin) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven discoveries narrowing to forgiveness; cost unmistakable in foreclosed isolation as fingers linger on coin handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kintsugi/redemption emerges organically from coin forging, carved anvil, and "Forgive" slab; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting fractures as "part of the design" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (precision tinting details like "faint scratches—deliberate, like chisel marks"); brief dialogue natural/subtextual, advances to clarity in "You came."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion (varied openings, purposeful lyricism); no loops/artifacts, overwriting restrained and pattern-taught via industrial imagery charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of industrial alchemy, kintsugi scars, and name-as-confession transforms tropes; risk in quiet Charged Poise ending heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
