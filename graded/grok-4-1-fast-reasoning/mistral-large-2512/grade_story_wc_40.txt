<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in reverence drives micro-choices like whispering "Grow" and humming, earning the realization; interiority concrete via breath visible and temple press. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sound experiments to CR closure ("silence was not the absence... became meaning") with conceptual cost in past demanding to be heard; crystal's final placement recharges as witness. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal as micro-setting constrains choices (amplifies sound, rises on hum) and charges final image ("facets catching the light like a promise"). Sensory hierarchy (sounds over sights) reflects POV; library acoustics evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening (whisper → hum → temple press reveals heartbeat rhythm), narrowing to realization; agency in experiments, felt cost in obsession's weight settling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (silence as meaning-space) emerges organically from sound trials and gardens "remembering"; final image offers non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant via crystal-library interplay, no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (sounds/silences beneath noise); rhythmic diction modulates from hushed to pulsing ("shadows dance"), purposeful for Accumulative texture. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hum beat vs. flowing realization); minor overwriting in metaphors ("stained glass," "shadows dance") purposeful but slightly muddled in dawn light beat, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonically recording crystal ties dictionaries' end to gardens remembering via sound patterns; transformed hermit-scholar trope through textured experiments, inevitable hindsight payoff in CR.</comment>
