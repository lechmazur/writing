<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve hope through shadows is rooted in particular traits like sharp-eyed observation, with embodied actions like hovering fingers and deliberate movements earning his final smile. Internal conflict is subtle but present in patient endurance versus urgency, shown in softly deliberate choices under shadow's coil. No major slips touch closure; single-POV interiority coheres without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from observations to footage merge, delivering Charged Poise closure where Elias smiles and listens, reconfiguring hope with legible cost of patience ("nothing worth preserving ever did"). Orientation anchors early (library, Elias, stone). Single scene holds; no causality breaks, constraint of shadow shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blooming library and river stone constrain choices (terminal access, stone's warmth/pulse) and charge closure (vines unfolding, stone rolls). Sensory details (petals glowing, shadow cold) filter through Elias's priorities, vivid yet economical. Spatial choreography clear; petals mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove shadows preserve past/hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shadow's coil, stone pulse, and footage overlap narrowing to realization. Agency in reaching controls forces trade-off of quick restoration for patient listening. Cost felt in "valley wouldn’t return overnight"; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as persistent river emerges organically from river footage, shadow echoes, and final listening image reweighting preservation as movement. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like merged reels avoids binaries. Final realization ("hope... always moving") answers central question non-literally with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (dusk noticing, shadow tracing) modulates rhythmically to closure's quiet poise. Lyrical diction ("sky bruised from blue to violet") purposeful, biased to Elias's sensitivity. No head-hopping or withholding; voice intensifies subtly under shadow pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shadow unbound slithered... something older" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density ("pooled like spilled ink") pattern-taught without muddle or loops. Propulsion clean to closure image; no scaffolds dull peak merge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, unbound shadow, and blooming library transforms loss tropes into luminous conceptual pursuit. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via patient observation paying off in shadow's dissolution. Inevitable hindsight from stone/river echoes; no derivatives.</comment>
