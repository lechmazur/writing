<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ethical storytelling shines through micro-choices like tracing the stick and telling the echo tale, earning serenity despite rawness from the argument. Interiority particular via ink fingers and shifting symbols. Solo POV limits crucible dynamics but delivers embodied endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (dome, candle) to closure CR in candle's guttering-to-softer light, reweighting post-argument stance with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (cliffs, dome interior). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's acoustics constrain voice and breath, charging final hush; recurring shadows and creaks mirror internal shift. Sensory selection POV-biased (symbols shifting by light). Micro-setting (stick, candle) guides telling act and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical reversal post-argument) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puppet recall to echo story's deepening, narrowing to serene renunciation. Cost legible in rawness clarified by performance. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stories as weapons emerges organically from fisher/echo tales and dome's listening shift, resonant in final softer light without moralizing. Subtext in unraveling threads reweights premise. Protagonist arc inextricable from ethical question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (symbols beating wings), stable close third-person POV. Rhythm modulates serene hush to flickering tension. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action (e.g., "words spilling like ink from a broken nib"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density (ivy, ribs groaning) purposeful, no loops or muddle touching closure. Concise propulsion holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher's puppets in bars evolve to dome unraveling, stick's living symbols transform trope. Risky lyric meditation on stories coheres, inevitable hindsight in candle's breath-like return.</comment>
