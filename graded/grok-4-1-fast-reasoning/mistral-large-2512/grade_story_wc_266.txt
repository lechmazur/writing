<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in backstory rupture ("the leash had broken") compels her journey, with micro-choices like tightening fingers and stepping ashore earning her shift; Elias applies steady pressure as foil. Interiority concrete but epiphanies like "courage... was something you *traversed*" border on unearned summation. Contradictory impulses (waiting vs. acting) layer realistically without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density builds from ferry straight path to inlet/cove via motivated dialogue and steering, tightening to CR closure ("something inside her shifted") with felt cost in her new agency. Orientation anchors early (Elias, Mira, Ridgeway). Single continuous scene with seamless shore transition; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Mira's urgency: lapping water as "shoreline lullaby," damp earth/salt smell, glowing punch/stars constrain her choices and charge final image (punch pressed to air). Setting guides via reeds/rocks/inlet, mirroring internal bends. No white-room; coherent choreography from hull to sand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through indirect route and cove chorus, forcing stance crystallization in punch-use/forward steps with legible cost (foreclosing passenger identity). Agency in Mira's shore action narrows options under lens. One tightening (cove emergence) suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of courage as traversal emerges organically from punch-stamp backstory, indirect bends, and final shift without statement; resonant CR reweights premise via star-lit reprise. Subtext in Elias's riddles ("best things hide in the bends") invites ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity in "unused courage waits."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Mira with clean Elias focalization; perceptual bias (noticing punch glow, shadows) distinct. Dialogue subtextual ("not the one you expect"), goal-driven, idiom varied (Elias's humming, riddles). Rhythmic prose modulates from lullaby calm to pulse-quickened tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "ticket punch glinted... first stars" advances image/stakes). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative coherence (labyrinth reeds, dancing shadows). Propulsion clean to closure image, read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ferryman guide trope transformed via ticket punch as courage key and Ridgeway's mist-memory physics; fresh synthesis in star-stamp glow/shift. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at shore CR. Familiar Charon echo slightly derivative but grounded in specifics.</comment>
