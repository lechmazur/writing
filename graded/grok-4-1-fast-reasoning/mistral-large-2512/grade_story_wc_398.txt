<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (tracing singed letter with calloused fingers), contradictory impulses surface in "wanted to believe but past a thorn," final reach earned via dialogue pressure; minor epiphanic polish in grandmother recall doesn't flatten choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (vines, letter, mist) tightens to Charged Poise RR at hand-brush/final vines swaying, reconfiguring mismatch with felt relational cost ("carry it together"); orientation anchored by ~100 words, one deepening via Elias arrival and confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid selective sensory (rippling canvas, boots sinking damp earth, amber light on temples) integrates via POV; vines recur to constrain insight/charge closure image, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust after hurt) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through "Why now?" exchange to "You hurt me" admission narrowing doubt path; agency in reach forecloses isolation with legible emotional cost charging vines' approval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mismatch-to-growth emerges organically from particulars (grandmother's vines/olives to stubborn oak roots); resonant non-literal close in rediscovery avoids moralizing, though "nurturing intersubjective understanding" borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd Liora POV with perceptual bias (vines as relational gauge); dialogue natural/subtextual ("I had to" vs. "Why now?"), rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory to poised close without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propulsion (multi-job lines like letter-trace anchoring emotion/props), varied rhythm/syntax; figurative purposeful without muddle or loops, read-aloud natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh vineyard-soul synthesis transforms reunion trope via stubborn-roots parallel grown from particulars; risk in subtle epiphany pays off without gimmick, memorable perceptual angle.</comment>
