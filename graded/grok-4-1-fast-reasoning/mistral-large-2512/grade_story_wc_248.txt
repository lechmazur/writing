<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivations root in consistent traits and intensify to Elara's alliance choice; contradictory impulses subtle in pursuit vs. revelation. Interiority concrete but light on embodied stress during pivotal confrontation. Earned change forecloses lone pursuit with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkages from clues to Scribe encounter to tapestry fit and lock turn deliver DC closure; "the archway’s lock began to turn" makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of unsealing. Single scene, lens holds firmly. Orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scorched parchment smell and dust narrow perception, guiding crouch and trace actions; vandalized mural constrains revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects analytical urgency. Final tapestry glow charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth pursuit tightens via liberator realization, narrowing options through agency in "Then let me help." Cost legible in path foreclosure to join. Pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silenced promise theme emerges from defaced portraits and key twist, reweighting destruction as revelation without statement. Final tapestry resolves non-literally with ambiguity of unsealing cost. Organic from conflict particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in pattern-piecing; dialogue subtext-heavy ("You’re late") pursues goals distinctly. Prose rhythm modulates tension, "embers settling" laugh textured. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied syntax; minor metaphor density ("fever-bright," "volcanic tenderness") in opener but no muddle at closure. No loops or scaffolds; image-driven over tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arsonist-as-liberator twist transforms trope via art trail synthesis, inevitable in hindsight from "promise" spines. Bold premise commitment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
