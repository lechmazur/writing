<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (ignoring hum vs. kneeling to feel it) compel the climax reading; final endurance earned via prior micro-choices like tracing engravings. Minor reflective summary dilutes peak pressure slightly before book opening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density crescendo (hum swelling, shelves rearranging) to Charged Poise closure; shadow lengthening and heart lightening mark legible before/after with felt cost of carrying past. Orientation anchored early in library details; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial and hum constrain choices (aligning dial points to book, palm to floor feels vibration) and charge final image; selective sensory details (cool metal, shimmering words) mirror internal reweighting without catalog. Recurring obsidian/tidal elements evolve purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coexist vs. consume past) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum escalation forcing stance crystallization in reading aloud; trembling fingers show visible cost charging library response. Single deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of independence as chosen burden emerges organically from sundial guidance and book activation; final "heart lighter" reconfigures isolation without moralizing, resonating via prior particulars like brittle awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (vibrations as heartbeat memory) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from steady reflection to swelling intensity at shelves rearranging, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation (short pulses at hum swell, longer breaths in reflections); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—sundial shadow "stretched across the shelf" propels cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation memory with guiding relic in tidal library transforms isolation trope; sundial's atomically reflective shadow as plot engine feels inevitable, risking lyric fantasy without gimmick.</comment>
