<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied tracing of symbols and obsession with pebbles; final shedding of weight feels earned through prior realization of map motive. Contradictory impulses subtle in shift from seeking to retelling silence. Minor lack of overt internal conflict in climax holds back 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush, pauses, clattering pebbles builds to CR closure where silence reconfigures endless night, cost in booklet's dust legible at "now little more than dust." Orientation anchored early in shore/fort/star. One tightening via ambered hush revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pebbles and fort constrain choices (tracing rhythms into map, climbing slick path); recur to charge final shore image. Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased (salt spray on robes, cold stones under feet). Final marbled blue sky mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (draw map) signaled early, tightens texturally via silence-weaving to Charged Poise where she stands silent; cost felt in star's absence and booklet loss. Agency in micro-choices like exhaling and tracing. Escalation coherent but lacks sharper trade-off narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-full emerges organically from pauses/lines and endless night repriced as promise; final "let the silence be enough" resonates without stating moral. Pebbles shift from obsessed objects to echoes charging end. No tidy binaries, ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (sea-polished curves, breathing dark); rhythm modulates from hush to rising wind. Compression purposeful and taught early, legible at closure. Voice embodies oracle's quiet intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors like "flaking gold leaf" and "marbled hush" consistent, propel via varied rhythm. Propulsion peaks in "map took shape in her mind," breathes in pauses. Zero scaffold, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mapping silence via booklet/pebbles transforms trope into textured CR; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmick. Particular images (tide whispering secrets) memorable. Derivative whisper of mythic oracle mildly limits peak.</comment>
