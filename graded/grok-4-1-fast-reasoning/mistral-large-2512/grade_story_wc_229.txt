<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove whispers travel farther drives concrete micro-choices like blowing the cork and whispering to the vial, earning Maren's silent understanding as closure. Interiority embodied in bone vibrations and garden scent memory feels particular. Minor abstractness in initial trait consistency prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from cork grooves to rain stutter and cliff echo as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting whispers premise with Maren's caught breath as felt cost. Single scene anchors early (lighthouse, dawn, heat wave). Closure image of lingering scent undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cliff edge constrains drop choice; lantern glass vibrations and streaking rain charge final dawn image. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects Elias's perceptual bias. Environment evolves with storm, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers) signaled early tightens via vial drop and echo reversal under accumulative lens, narrowing skepticism with audible cost to vial. Agency in whisper forecloses doubt path. No further escalation needed for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intent's quiet power emerges organically from cork blow to world-bending echo, final garden scent reweighting shouts vs whispers without moral. Subtext in Maren's scoff-to-silence charges ambiguity. Resonant counter-reading in storm's rage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as whispers/replies). Voice rhythm modulates tenderly amid storm; distinct dialogue (Maren's "rough as driftwood"). No head-hopping, diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short sentences in drop); high density integrates sensory advance. Minor figurative density ("storm’s hunger") purposeful, no loops or muddle at echo climax. Propulsion clear to final exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse isolation with vibration physics and purifying scent transforms whisper trope organically. Risk in cork-as-message pays off at echo without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from early grooves motif.</comment>
