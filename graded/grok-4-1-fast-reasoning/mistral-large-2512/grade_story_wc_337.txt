<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses peak in hesitation over "This was not restoration. This was butchery," earning the final needle drive through prior dreams and knot-unraveling choices with embodied cost in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds via knot releases to mask realization; on-page DC closure in needle pierce with legible butchery cost reconfigures options, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prism light and net rafters constrain ladder climb and knot access, charging final mask pulse; sensory hush braids pressurally without visual overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake to free spirits tightens texturally via deepening hush and voices, forcing unmaking agency; King interruption narrows options with opposition cost felt in grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Restoration-as-butchery emerges implicitly from net/mask interplay, resonant in screaming threads reweighting burial vs. freedom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual bias (light-tracing spectacles) with rhythmic modulation under stress; sparse dialogue rasps idiomatically distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (threads "drink the light"); no loops, clean propulsion to screaming climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fisher King net/mask synthesis transforms folklore into silence-accumulating hush with inevitable needle climax; bold mythic risk heightens without gimmick.</comment>
