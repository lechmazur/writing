<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (trembling hands vs. steady grip on telescope) build to earned renunciation at railing; motivation rooted in father’s loss intensifies via ship vision without unearned epiphany. Minor therapy-speak in "unspoken apologies" clouds peak authenticity but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cloud categorizing and telescope use build density to CR closure (ship sighting reconfigures sky as accomplice, cost in leap's final image); orientation anchored early in gondola/sky. Single scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass telescope as micro-setting constrains revelation and charges final leap; sensory details (groaning fittings, fogged eyepiece) filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal churn without overt symbolism. Environment guides choice via railing/wind proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove spaces remember) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ship vision tightening to renunciation; agency in climbing railing forecloses endurance path with felt cost in "wind carry him forward." One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unforgiving memory emerges organically from cloud echoes and ship image, resonant CR in leap reweights premise without moralizing; subtext in "empty spaces remembered, but didn’t forgive" lingers with ambiguity. Final image answers via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (clouds as emotions); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, propulsive final sentences. Voice specificity in syntax reflects fractured mind under accumulating pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; minor metaphor density ("pressure building behind the silence") in mid-beats borders overwriting but integrates without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional meteorology and visionary leap transforms airship trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, with ship reveal inevitable from cloud-categorizing setup. Non-obvious gondola as "vessel of spooled wholeness" anchors originality.</comment>
