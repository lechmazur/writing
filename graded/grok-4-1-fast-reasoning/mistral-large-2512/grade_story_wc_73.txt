<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grim optimist embodied effectively in dice roll despite infinite risk, earning final endurance; abstract "texture of missed opportunity" slightly unearned without deeper contradictory impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern break at dice roll ("staircase shuddered... cracks spiderwebbing") delivering RR closure; reconfiguration cost legible in "not the end he had expected," reweighting infinity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chipped die flaw and stone scent constrain roll choice and charge final warm pickup; selective sensory narrowing under climb urgency mirrors internal resolve without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rupture cycle) tightens via agency-driven roll, foreclosing total break with adaptation cost; pattern shift forces endurance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of adaptable infinity emerges organically from dice disruption and final climb image, offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with mathematical perceptual bias ("its balance... fragile"); lyrical rhythm modulates pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "hope like a bruise"; minor "balance" recurrence pattern-taught and thematic, no loops dulling roll climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math proofs, chipped dice, and infinite staircase rupture feels inevitable; risk in variable disruption heightens stakes organically.</comment>
