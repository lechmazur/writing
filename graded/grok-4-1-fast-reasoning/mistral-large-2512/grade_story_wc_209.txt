<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like fingers tracing postcards and breath fogging glass reveals obsession concretely; motivation intensifies via grandmother's memory cueing present search. Quietly driven trait constrains choices without overt conflict, earning final acceptance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal cathedral moment, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of flower images, postcards, and glass builds to CR closure where "darkness was not the absence of light" reconfigures premise with felt cost of prior unnamed tug resolved via painting. Orientation anchored early at pavilion; two shards transition legibly. No causality breaks; pattern tightens meaningfully at snow-melt glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "scent of damp earth and decaying leaves" and etched glass pulsing constrain her gaze and charge final pavilion return. Recurrent flowers mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism. Cathedral micro-setting guides revelation; spatial choreography clear across moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why flowers bloom at night) signaled early, escalates texturally via postcards-to-glass deepening that narrows to epiphany under melting snow pressure. Agency in lighting candle and spreading postcards on altar forecloses fruitless search with acceptance cost. Quiet but coherent tightening fits lens; lacks visceral reversal but one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of darkness as illumination emerges organically from particulars like night-blooming cereus memory and glass flowers glowing brighter. Final image of painted petal offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting search without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity in "spaces between" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (unseen patterns, whispers) stable in single POV; diction modulates tenderly from hush to revelation. Rhythm breathes with scene, syntax poetic yet legible. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present cues like grandmother's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm: "brushstrokes quiet but deliberate, each one a whisper" propels without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("honey in dim autumn light," "pull of the moon") during opener risks purple tint but serves voice; no artifacts dull closure image of unfurling petal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postcards, etched glass flowers, and snow-melt epiphany transforms quiet revelation trope via specific hidden layers and umbral details. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of unseen truth without gimmick. No derivative echoes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
