<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's trembling hands tracing the maple and slow alignment of compass on lace embody particular regret without stock phrasing; final weaving mends with earned cost from severance backstory anchored in present choices. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, tilting toward sequential reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (mist, drips) and memory shards build to CR closure where weaving reconfigures regret with conceptual cost of non-undoing; orientation anchored early in islet post-rain. Lace path provides one meaningful tightening via memory knots, needle steadying as visible price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bonsai, compass, and lace as micro-settings constrain choices (aligning needle, following stitches) and charge final weaving image; sensory selection (salt, damp earth, droplets) filters through Elias's patient POV, evolving causally with mist-to-breeze shift. No generic placeholders; details tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding apology's color) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lace-guided memories narrowing to cerulean realization; agency in fingertip tracing forecloses undoing past with felt diffusion cost. Minor abstractness in stakes softens visceral edge before final shears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of diffusible regret emerges organically from lace stitches and compass pulse, culminating in non-literal final image of thread in maple reweighting severance without moralizing. Particulars (knots as silences) resist platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "stitch by stitch" endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in measured syntax mirroring slow-spoken tutor; rhythmic prose modulates from placid drip to horizon-pointing poise without filter excess. Lyrical compression taught early via mist curls pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "threads shimmered...path emerged" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, but minor figurative density in opening (mist curling, droplets cadence) risks overwriting without full pattern payoff. Zero loops; clean propulsion to ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai precision with lace-memory navigation transforms regret trope into "cerulean" color quest; risk-taking in woven instructions heightens ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight via compass reprise. No derivative templates; bold conceptual frame commits fully.</comment>
