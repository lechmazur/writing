<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in years of tracing echoes compels choices like taking the spiral despite hesitation; interiority embodied via heart hammering and burning pendant. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps at very strong; final resolve earned without deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whispers and vibrations build density to chamber; on-page CR closure in "world dissolved into light" with cost via groaning chamber and searing pendant. Continuous rooftop shard progression tightens meaningfully at hourglass touch; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors like spiraling water and eye-carved walls constrain path choices and charge climax; rooftop canals as micro-setting force spiral decision and mirror internal pulse. POV-filtered illustrator gaze notices vibrations purposefully; final hourglass image recharged by prior vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncage echoes escalates accumulatively via intensifying whispers ("before the Giant wakes") and pendant burn narrowing to hourglass turn; agency in spiral choice forecloses upward path with felt risk. Cost legible in chamber groan and time bend charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time-borrowing emerges organically from whispers and Nap lore, reweighted in dissolution image without moralizing; lingering ambiguity on success invites reflection. Final reconfiguration answers echo-birth quest non-literally via uncaged moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in time-as-wet-paper metaphors biased toward unseen cracks; rhythmic prose modulates from steady breaths to gasped resolve. Voice texture distinct and pressure-responsive, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "sand frozen mid-fall" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm accelerates to climax without loops or overwriting. Zero artifacts; propulsion peaks in "time bent around her."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rooftop canals and Giant's Nap transforms time-portal trope via illustrator's echo-hunt; dissolution image inevitable from accumulative whispers. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
