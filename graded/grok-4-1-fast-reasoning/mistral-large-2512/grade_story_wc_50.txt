<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via peripheral focus enabling the reflection sighting, with embodied reactions like pulse quickening and breath fogging; motivation to capture echoes intensifies credibly to realization. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; competent struggle feels light but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("The harvest was not about storing wonder for later"); orientation anchored early (cavern beneath shop). One tightening via quartz adjustment summoning boy-Elias activates timer with felt conceptual cost in rewinding time image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz walls and skylight constrain choices (sliver pries gears, tilting sharpens reflection, light angles pool in crevices); sensory details selective via POV (lamplight on teeth, hum like chimes). Final light from echoes charges closure image perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest echoes via timer) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to boy-appearance reversal narrowing options to release. Agency in quartz use drives escalation; cost legible in foreclosed storage path, though subtle under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of releasing vs. storing wonder emerges organically from timer/echoes/light particulars, resonant CR in final realization reweights premise without statement. Boy's touch and swirling fireflies offer non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (light fracturing, grooves traced); rhythmic prose modulates from tinkering calm to transfixed intensity. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged final cadence syncing heartbeat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (gears "groaned, then stuttered"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("liquid gold," "winter’s teeth") purposeful without muddling peak reflection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh locksmith-echoes synthesis transforms time-tinkering trope via peripheral quartz reflections and conceptual harvest shift. Risky lyric CR feels inevitable from light/angle buildup, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
