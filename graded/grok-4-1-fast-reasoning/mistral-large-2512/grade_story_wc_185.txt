<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mapkeeper duty intensifies to compel binding the bloom; micro-choices like conjuring light and pressing the stone reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete via embodied sensations (warm stone, hitched breath), but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: examining cracks therefore reveals passage, binding stone therefore collapses bloom with legible cost in "its last whisper absorbed." Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in caves post-energy beings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves constrain choices via warping ice and groans that force quick movement; recurring ice cracks and stone charge final emergence image. Sensory hierarchy (hum fading to silence) mirrors Ryn's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hush against beings) tightens via stone's erratic flare, forcing bind-or-lose agency; cost unmistakable in bloom's collapse narrowing options to flight. Causal escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of carrying quiet amid chaos emerges organically from binding and escape; final "not entirely... but enough" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like stone's pulse avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ripple/frequency noticing; voice texture modulates rhythmically from humming caves to silent poise. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; metaphors like "needle through fabric" purposeful without muddle in peak binding beat. Minor overwriting in descriptive openings, but no loops or scaffold dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapkeeper ripples, hush bloom, and warped harmonics transforms fantasy tropes; risk in fragile silence premise heightens stakes organically to charged final stone pulse.</comment>
