<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority through grief-embodied actions like folding cranes and polishing dreams; contradictory impulses peak when lanterns feed back sorrow, earning the transformative endurance. Final invasion traces to her persistent choices, with visible cost in the dream whispering her brother's name. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive inevitable overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream-shaping builds to shattering lantern as CR/RR closure, reweighting premise with cost of reciprocal transformation legible in "the light climbed her arm... and then—it was inside her." Orientation anchored early in workshop/garden; no shards, single scene coherent. Persistent lantern constraint shapes tactics to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring glass basilica and upside-down bonsai constrain choices (climbing chains, hanging cranes) and charge final image via pulsing dreams spilling out. Sensory hierarchy (soot-stained fingers, jasmine air) reflects Veyra's priorities; details evolve causally with shattering. Micro-setting of lanterns as tools mirrors internal grief purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape grief-dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via feeding realization and shatter narrowing options to invasion. Agency in selecting/polishing dreams drives escalation; cost unmistakable in serpent-coiling light invading her, foreclosing control. No coincidences resolve; moral calculus of polishing rot confronts her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal grief (shaping dreams, shaped by them) emerges from lantern/dream/crane particulars, reweighted non-literally in final transformation image answering "cleaner" sorrow's peril. Subtext in priests' ignored offerings and birds-from-tears implies complexity without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from Veyra's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light as ribbons/smoke, grief as rot); syntax/rhythm modulate from calm polishing to terse climax shatter. No head-hopping or withholding; diction character-bound to craftswoman's precision. Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers, stained with soot and solder, moved with the precision of a thief’s lockpick"); varied rhythm accelerates to "sound like breaking ice" climax without loops or muddled metaphors. Zero scaffolds; propulsion clear through action-integrated images. Read-aloud ear flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-gems in lanterns amid shadow-peeled sky transforms tropes organically; risk in luminous surrealism heightens stakes to transformative cost. Premise implications followed boldly without retreat; final reconfiguration inevitable from established dream-feeding pattern.</comment>
