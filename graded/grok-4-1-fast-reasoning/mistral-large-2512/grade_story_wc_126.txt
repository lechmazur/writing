<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in inherited tradition compels micro-choices like dipping the bowl after the hum; interiority concrete and embodied in "breath caught" and vibrations through feet. Minimal contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously limits perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase to hum response and improv; closure as Charged Poise in "hush felt different now—less like absence, more like anticipation," cost legible in lingering fingers on bowl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse ribs and glass constrain acoustics for play, guiding choices; shipwrecks creak and fish circle charge final image, sensory hierarchy reflects violinist's ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to coax sound from hush signaled early, deepens at hum into world-dialogue; agency in bowl dip and improv forecloses silence with felt tradition cost, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in fragments emerges from play-hum weave; final packing image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting silence as anticipation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct acoustic perceptual signature; syntax/rhythm modulate from deliberate tuning to spiraling notes, stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density in sensory integration; purposeful "unfinished" motif repetition borders minor loop but serves theme without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-apocalyptic acoustic world with echo-harbor violinist transforms tropes; hum-play synthesis feels inevitable from acoustics and tradition.</comment>
