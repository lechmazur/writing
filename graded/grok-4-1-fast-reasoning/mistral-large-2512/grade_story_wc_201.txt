<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation before drinking the vial despite trauma aversion, earning the realization; interiority particular via precise, equation-like embodiment of pain. Final choice to embrace the "key" forecloses denial with conceptual cost. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and trauma cues build to CR closure: equations manifest and strap glows, reweighting mercy as variable with undeniable weight ("braced... against the weight"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via vial suffices. Cost legible in final brace image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forest constrains via resin jolt mirroring trauma and pulsing with Elias's pulse, charging final grid vision; micro-setting (bark, haze) integrates tactilely. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis. Pewter strap as recurring object recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) tightens via vial agency, narrowing to vision under Accumulative lens; cost felt in shift from destruction to illumination. Stranger complicates without resolving. Final image crystallizes trade-off: knowledge as burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via shifting equations and strap's glow, reweighting premise (mercy as variable, not fixed); non-literal answer in "knowing when to stop" avoids moralizing. Particulars like UV resin anchor complexity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with mathematical perceptual signature ("each joint a calculated equation"); voice modulates rhythmically under stress. Dialogue sparse, subtextual ("truth"). No head-hopping; diction precise, biased to trauma math.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images ("trees pulsed... absorbing") advance texture without loops. Varied syntax breathes with visionary peak; minor UV repetition doesn't dull closure. Clean mechanics, no artifacts in final beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma math, UV penance, proprioception transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric CR (forest grid) heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight via strap's evolution. Bold premise commits without retreat.</comment>
