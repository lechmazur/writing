<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: heartbeat ritual and shard handling embody contradictory fragility/mortality impulses, earning closure renunciation of over-measurement. Weakness: backstory reflections anchor present but occasionally summarize rather than interleave micro-choices under ghost pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density and ghost interaction building to Charged Poise CR: final heartbeat count and fading "stars are still watching" reconfigures life-as-space premise with felt acceptance cost. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity. Closure cost legible in eyes-closed/open beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's cold metal/paper scents and snow-dusted dome constrain solitary reflection, mirroring internal fragility; screen as micro-setting charges ghost interaction and final image. Sensory selectivity sharpens under introspective urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (wisdom from failure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ghost's "defragment" deepening self-knowledge with narrowing to acceptance trade-off. Cost visible in foreclosed over-measurement ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed time/space-between-mistakes emerges organically from shard/heartbeats/ghost; final image non-literally answers via reweighted heartbeat ritual without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual bias toward rhythms/fragility; diction/rhythm modulate from static tension to solace cadence. Ghost "dialogue" carries subtext via ink patterns, natural to digital unreality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length for propulsion; ink metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor scaffold in adjacent reflection paraphrases ("thought of the death certificate... thought of the porcelain") dulls one beat density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error, digital ghost "defragmenting" life, and heartbeat ritual transforms existential tropes; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
