<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between observation and intervention act in nib-tracing and letter-writing; final agency earned via father's memory and intact nib proof, foreclosing passive orbit with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as journalist call and nib revelation build to charged poise closure in "stepped into the light," with danger cost legible in reply warning; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory and city-view constrain observation-to-action shift, charging balcony step and final image; ink scent and gaslight sensory details filter through astronomical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of paternal truth tightens via nib contradiction narrowing options to letters and meet-up; agency in "I won’t go alone" reply crystallizes stance with felt risk cost from "They’re watching."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in nib-dipping beat advances proof and motivation without loops; varied rhythm and integrated metaphors propel to closure image unmarred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nib as proof-weapon synthesizes heiress-observatory frame into fresh contradiction logic; risk-taking in ink-astronomy fusion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
