<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation over the doorknocker, earning the final touch with embodied scar burn and lung expansion as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knocking density builds to scar-linked arrival; closure RR via mutual breathing reconfigures isolation with felt cost in "her own lungs expanding as if for the first time in years."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary, ring, and starlight constrain choice (walls press, ring pulses with breaths), charging final image; selective sensory filter mirrors POV isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of isolation vs. scar-bridges tightens via rhythmic knocking pattern break and child confrontation, driven by world's accumulation; agency in kneeling touch forecloses solitude with unmistakable mutual breath cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scars-as-bridges theme emerges organically from knocking echoes and final touch, offering resonant non-literal answer that reweights isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (shadows, breaths, scars); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("teach suffocating to breathe"); rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from setup to peak; no loops, purposeful figures (mold on bread) integrate without muddle, even in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of healer-turned-isolator linked by scars transforms tropes; risk in quiet conceptual closure feels inevitable from scar pattern.</comment>
