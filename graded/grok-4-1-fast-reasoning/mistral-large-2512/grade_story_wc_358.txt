<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between instruments and intuition act in scene via scanner use under rising anomalies; final flight earned by accumulating pressure with clutched patch revealing foresight's cost. Exceptional embodiment in pulse quickening and tightening fingers during heat scan.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly density (wind to hum) tightens from investigation to entrapment; CR closure lands via sealing containers reweighting city as learning entity, cost legible in rearranging paths and final image. Orientation anchored early in port silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth setting constrains choices, charging final rearrangement; recurring wind eddies and salt/rust filter through engineering bias, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Body/thermal scanner as micro-setting narrows perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing transformation escalates via accumulative density (groan-movement-heat), agency in documenting/scanning forces run with narrowing options; cost unmistakable in clutched patch and sealed gaps under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of foresight vs. relentless reinvention emerges organically from particulars like wind redirection and city learning; final howling wind image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with engineering perceptual signature (vibration patterns, eddies); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in run beat, diction precise yet hazy without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates through anomaly beats; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion, purposeful similes (joint popping) enhance without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of accident probe into sentient port reinvention feels inevitable via grounded anomalies; risk in adaptive city logic heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
