<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory fear/hope in mentoring Mira, embodied in trembling fingers and final handoff, earns the closure choice with visible relational cost. Backstory of failed apprentice anchors present micro-choices without flattening pressure. Mira applies immediate pressure as secondary character, forcing status shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: Mira's arrival and questions build density toward Charged Poise closure in teacup handoff, reweighting exile with felt hope/fear cost in final lines. Single scene anchors orientation early (library/Elara by para 1). One tightening via interaction suffices, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard-mirror and shadow constrain Elara's fractured perception and work, charging final teacup image; playground swing sound mirrors internal resilience theme, evolving with Mira's presence. Sensory details (cracked leather, ink smell) integrate via POV bias, no white-room. Micro-setting (teacup leaves) guides pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile vs. quiet mentoring) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mira's "Can I try?" forcing explanatory vulnerability and handoff renunciation of isolation. Cost legible in "combative tenderness" flare, foreclosing safe stasis. Coherent pressure without reversals fits lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from shadow annotation and Mira's backward steps, resonant in final teacup handoff reweighting exile without moralizing. Subtext in implication (tea leaves predict light changes) invites ambiguity on readiness. No tidy resolution; counter-reading of persistent failure lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elara POV with perceptual signature (fractured reflections, shadow focus); dialogue natural/subtextual ("It helps me think") distinguishes voices and advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in interaction); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "spines split like dry lips"); metaphors consistent/patterned (fractures/shadows) without muddle in peak handoff beat. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting; every line propels via image-action fusion. Read-aloud propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist and tea-leaf shadow prediction synthesize fresh premise organically, transforming exile trope via specific resilience mentoring. Risky imagistic voice heightens stakes without gimmick; final "undo her own exile?" feels inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
