<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in synesthesia and betrayal intensifies via wife's lie memory; embodied scars and forge heat particularize interiority. Final smile earns endurance with cost of dying isolation. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density tightens to foil imprint CR; cost legible in "cancer...whisper, not a scream" amid acceptance. Orientation anchors immediately in ruins; one-shard scope perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forge heat constrains imprint choice and pulses to charge final foil image under aurora. Synesthetic colors/sounds filter via Elias bias; shipwrecks' groan mirrors sea hatred tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to capture trust's silence signaled early, deepens accumulatively via notes to betrayal recall forcing imprint agency. Cancer timeframe tightens with felt opportunity cost; no reversal but cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence-as-memory emerges organically from imprints, reweighted in "hollow, echoing blue" to foil ripple without moral. Betrayal green cracks premise of grandfather's "gift"; ambiguity of "enough" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("hear...color of her lie—a sharp, brittle green") biases uniquely; rhythmic compression heightens forge poise. Stable close-third; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density layers sensory propulsion without loops; metaphors cohere ("ribs...like shipwrecks") to crisp "foil...rippling" closure. Varied rhythm breathes with memory beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia imprinting betrayal's silence synthesizes freshly from sound-memory trope; risk of surreal "absences" pays in inevitable CR. No derivative echoes.</comment>
