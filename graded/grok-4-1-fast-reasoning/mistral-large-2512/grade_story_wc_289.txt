<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find her thread roots in ghostwriting trait and intensifies via micro-choices like plucking twig and writing letter; earned change in self-seeing forecloses endless seeking. Sages apply pressure but verge archetypal without deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density (twig-spirals, mirrors) tightening to Charged Poise closure; Mira's letter in pond and final self-reflection reconfigure options with felt cost of unspooled heart acceptance. Mosaic shards taught early via pattern-seeking; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond and mirrors constrain choices (nest tracing, sky fragments) and charge final image where temple/pond/sky/self unify; sensory selection (wet stone voice, slick petals) POV-biased toward patterns. Weather (cloud bursts) evolves causally, mirroring internal reclamation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find connecting thread) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through keeper/artist guidance to own-letter writing; agency in pursuing installation narrows options, with conceptual cost legible in "unspooled" admission and twig-as-key realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rejoining via stories/secrets emerges organically from twig motifs shifting meaning (question to key); final image offers resonant CR repricing ghostwriting as self-thread without moralizing. Subtext in silences (keeper's pause) and implications enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (spirals, fragments); voice poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm to pressure (short sentences at epiphany). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Public secrets"), distinguishing sages via whimsy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "white petals unfurling under...cloud bursts" sets atmosphere/plot); rhythm varies, propulsion strong. Minor overwriting in metaphors (whimsy as gravity) pattern-taught but dense in transitions; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghostwriter seeking self-thread via twig-weaving artist transforms tropes of epiphany into prismatic, motif-driven arc; fresh synthesis of secrets/public art feels inevitable, with risk in lyric mosaic heightening resonance.</comment>
