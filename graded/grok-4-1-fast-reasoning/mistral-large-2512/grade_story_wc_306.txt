<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices (pocket mirror, ask fear) reveal contradictory impulses under doubt's pressure, earning shift to understanding; Veyra's trembling hands embody vulnerability without labels. Minor abstractness in "razor's edge" dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of objects (mirror warms, chimes clatter) tightens to CR closure where lighthouse reconfigures as space for uncertainty, cost felt in cloak loosening and accepted nuance. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring mirror shard and chimes constrain choices (shard pulses agreement, chimes urge speech) and charge final image; sensory selection (wind tugs, ash/salt) mirrors internal doubt via POV bias, evolving causally with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unhook guilt) deepens accumulatively via Veyra's words and Elias's hesitation-to-ask, narrowing to nuance acceptance; agency in listening forecloses absolution path with felt emotional cost in cloak grip loosening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of messy truth emerges organically from mirror (fear not fact), cloak, and Veyra's spill; final image reweights binary guilt/innocence non-literally as "messy, beautiful uncertainty," lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual signature (fractured reflections, whispering cloak); dialogue natural/subtextual ("I didn’t kill her" vs. trembling), advances to turn; rhythm modulates tension without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor figurative density ("cloak draped...tightening") coherent for lens but borders overwrites in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "moral auditor," fear-mirror, doubt-cloak transforms confession trope into nuance quest; risk in personified objects heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
