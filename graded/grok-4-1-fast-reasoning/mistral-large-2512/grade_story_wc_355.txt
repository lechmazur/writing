<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in specific sensory mapping of silence as texture, with embodied tension in "chest tighten" before reunion; pacifist traits subtly motivate non-violent unlocking method. Liora's arrival forces relational crucible, earning her weary reverence. Minor flaw: vegetarian cue feels token without complicating peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences and failed frequencies builds to RR closure in diary's whisper-open and quote reweighting "silence isn’t something you measure"; cost legible in Liora's admission of Arctic failure. Orientation anchored early in workshop/diary; no shards, single scene fits defaults perfectly. Liora's door-click pays off resonance motif with undeniable before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop lattice-stars and solder-paper smells constrain tactile choices, evolving with lantern shadows to charge firework-gold closure image. Sensory hierarchy (Elias notices gear grooves, hums) reflects tinkering bias; slanted roof guides resonance tests before thunder drowns subtlety. Micro-setting (clasp, oscillator) forces patient tactics, recharging final tuning fork.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock truth via resonance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through failed thrum to higher pitch reversal narrowing options before fireworks; Liora's arrival deepens to relational cost. Agency in Elias's dial turns and fork-strike forecloses force path with felt patience price. Coherent pressure under Textural lens; minor slip in Liora coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of felt-vs-measured silence emerges organically from failed oscillator to diary quote "loudest silences... from ourselves," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Liora's "some truths too heavy" and Arctic quiet charges empathy path; counter-reading (catalog as folly) lingers plausibly. Fireworks contrast explodes resonance, avoiding tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person Elias POV with perceptual signature (silence shades, hand-listening); diction/rhythm modulates from patient buildup to "click" spike. Dialogue sparse/natural: Liora's "knack for hearing" carries subtext, distinguishing voices idiomatically. No head-hopping; compression in reflections anchors to clasp cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers tracing grooves" advances action/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, accelerating to "air shimmer." Minor metaphor density in opening ("lattice of stars," "veins") borders overwrite but supports Textural lens without muddle. No loops; clean syntax propels to firework cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-taxonomy + frequency-unlock transforms locked-diary trope into resonance-empathy premise; risk in theatrical reunion heightens stakes via Liora's warm fork. Non-obvious angle on pacifist tinkering avoids archetype; final quote/fireworks feels inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
