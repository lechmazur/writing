<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath hitched, fingers tremble) and contradictory impulses (doubt vs. need to know "if you were still you") compel the final hand-taking with relational cost; micro-choices reveal values shift from capture to sharing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via curl anchor and vial reveal to Charged Poise closure; "Time... the kind you feel" makes cost legible in final image without causal breaks; orientation anchored early at nexus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember nexus twilight (molten copper light, charred cedar/ozone) constrains choices (crouch on bridge, embers flare at decision) and charges final humming image; sensory hierarchy alchemical via POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (density of presence vs. Elias's change) deepens accumulatively via vial and curl drop narrowing solo capture option; agency in uncorking/drop forecloses isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of presence revalued from capture to sharing emerges via curl/vial particulars; final "share" image non-literally reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in Elias's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with alchemical perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("still you?") advances stakes; rhythm modulates from reflective to charged poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propulsion, varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue beats vs. flowing images); metaphors consistent (light spirals) without muddle or loops, even in peak vial reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical presence/time via nautilus curl transforms tropes organically; risk in quiet fantasy closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
