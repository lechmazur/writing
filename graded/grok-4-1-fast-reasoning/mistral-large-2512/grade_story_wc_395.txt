<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal disillusionment intensifies to compel copying despite danger; interiority concrete via pulse and trembling hands in video echo. Internal conflict embodied in "should stop, but couldn’t unsee," acting simultaneously. Final choice earned by prior digs; flaw in undramatized lie safety-hedges minor tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: number density patterns build knowledge from patch to folder/video discovery. Orientation anchored by para 2 (archive, job, Elias case). Closure as CR in "chosen a side" with settling weight cost legible on final line; one tightening via hidden folder suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive "hummed with quiet static," patch "frayed edges" tactile; video "grainy" and "dim light" sensory selective via data-sifter bias. Recurring patch/numbers constrain digging, charge final log image. Mirrors internal erasure; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover erasures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via number density to video revelation narrowing options. Agency in persistent digging/copy; cost felt in "pulse pounded" and implied danger foreclosing safety. Coheres to charged poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. erasure emerges from data ghosts, numbers, video; final "battleground" image reconfigures archive premise non-literally. Subtext in song echoes/silences; no moralizing, ambiguity in Nexis weapon lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: data fragments as "ghosts," sharp focus on metadata/timestamps. Prose texture in synth/static rhythm echoes theme; no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge (e.g., suspects before video). Compression purposeful, legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayer (e.g., "patch... stitched with 4-7-11" advances plot/atmosphere). Purposeful number repetition teaches pattern without loop; rhythm varies, no scaffolds, figurative clean ("digital graveyard"). Minor synonym churn on "numbers" deducts slightly, away from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: social archive as erasure weapon via spaceship patch/numbers code transforms digital trope. Project Echo reveal inevitable from Elias pattern; bold conceptual risk (rewriting existence) heightens stakes organically. No templates, memorable data-haunting angle.</comment>
