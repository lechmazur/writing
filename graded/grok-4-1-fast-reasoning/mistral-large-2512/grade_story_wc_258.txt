<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like trembling hands and shallow breath under rising mystery; final message choice earned by prior curiosity/doom tension. Micro-choices like measuring card edges reveal values hierarchy. No safety-hedging flaws; 9+ test met via impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: card examinations build to blueprint realization and Charged Poise closure in "Lira sent a single word: *How?*" with legible cost of stepping into the map. Single scene, orientation anchored early in loft/cartomancer intro. One tightening via path-multiplying suffices; cost proof in hover-then-send beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skylight prisms and rain rhythmically charge rising tension, mirroring internal fraying; workbench/tools constrain actions like spreading cards. Sensory hierarchy (ink bleeds, static glow) POV-biased. Recurring loft elements evolve with rain pickup to climax; 9+ test met as setting charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel deck invitation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via altered cards (Fool's coins-to-birds) narrowing to blueprint pressure; agency in arranging/sending forecloses ignorance path. Cost felt in "wondering what lay at its center" vs. entry. One deepening via texts reweights options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mapping vs. being mapped emerges organically from crypto-shattered cards to "You’re being mapped" whisper; final reply reweights premise non-literally. Resonance in dissolving coins/birds images; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers purposefully. 9+ test met via charged ending answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (measuring gaps/symbols); rhythmic prose modulates from steady curiosity to pulse-quickened stress. Text messages natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; diction biased to cartomantic idiom. 9+ test: signature holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors (oil-shimmer ink, sleeping serpent tape) consistent/patterned without muddle in peak card reveals. Propulsion via varied rhythm accelerates to rain-climax. Zero scaffold; 9+ test met, figurative coherent in beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crypto tarot reverse-engineering transforms tropes via specific ink bleeds/altered symbols; risk in accumulative card-build to mystery invitation feels inevitable. No derivatives; bold perceptual frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
