<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in embodied interiority via ink-stained fingers aching teeth and borrowed voices clashing internally; final hollowing earned by escalating overrides. Borrowed personalities reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during fragment touch and woman's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from type-setting to pulsing light and unraveling; CR closure via final quiet mind reweights premise with conceptual cost of lost voices in "mind quiet for the first time." Orientation anchored early in workshop/stars; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz glass refracts dying stars into tactile rainbows pooling like gold constraining hands at press; final star vanish/darkness charges closure image mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of graphing emotion tightens accumulatively via slipping equations, overriding voices, fragment dissolution narrowing control; cost legible in hollow vessel after unraveling, felt in peak "personalities unraveled like thread."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-theft/math futility emerges organically via twisted voices and predatory equation-grin; resonant CR in final "universe...only cares about the numbers" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in hum like "choir without vowels" and ink/parchment smells; voice rhythm modulates turbulence to charged poise, dialogue subtext sharp in woman's warning twisted to theft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varying syntax like "equations that mapped the weight of sorrow"; no loops, coherent metaphors (stars as missing teeth, barnacles on ribs), minor figurative density in peak unpenalized as pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress surrealism and personality-thief math elevates tropes; halo dissolution turn inevitable from prior hum-build, bold lyric turbulence risks pay off in CR hush.</comment>
