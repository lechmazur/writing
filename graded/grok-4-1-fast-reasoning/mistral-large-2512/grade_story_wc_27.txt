<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (toes curling, hum in bones) roots motivation to find meaning, with micro-choice to approach and touch earning hope; reflection on rebellion anchors to grandmother's glasses without flattening pressure. Minor slip: "awkwardly confident" label slightly abstracts trait rather than fully dramatizing contradictory impulses in pivotal touch moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with hum density building to roar, delivering Charged Poise/CR closure ("hum became a roar... quiet certainty that the fire wasn’t gone") reweighting rebellion's failure; orientation anchors early (bay, Lira, post-rebellion). One persistent constraint (hum's pull) shapes progression seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone/wildflowers, teeth ache) integrate via POV bias, with stones and glasses constraining observation and charging final touch; body (barefoot toes) mirrors internal draw. No generic placeholders; micro-setting evolves causally to thunderous payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite meaning post-rebellion lull) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum escalation and agency in pressing palm, foreclosing doubt with felt conceptual cost in hope's certainty. Entry to 8.8+ near-miss as trade-off not fully viscerally priced beyond image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten magic amid rebellion's whimper emerges organically from particulars (stones vs. fighters' exhaustion), resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing ("fire wasn’t gone—it just needed someone to reignite it"). Ambiguity lingers in hope's quiet cost, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (symbols shifting, earth breathing); poetic rhythm modulates from calm observation to roar's intensity without head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture (coined "thunderous serenity") purposeful and biased to Lira's solitary lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm/syntax; metaphors purposeful ("shadows stretching long and hungry") enhance without muddle. Minor overwrite in descriptive clusters (e.g., light as "spilled mercury") risks slight drag but spares closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi spaceport decay with ancient stone magic transforms post-rebellion tropes via grounded sensory hum and personal reignition; risk in "thunderous serenity" tone heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; turns feel inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
