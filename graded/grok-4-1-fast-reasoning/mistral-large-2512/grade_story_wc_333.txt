<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Locksmith's competence shines in concrete actions like twisting the hair until it hums, revealing traits under pressure, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses or visible struggle, making endurance feel smooth rather than earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of ritual imagery building to CR closure in the braided hair's handover—"Tell it"—with legible conceptual cost to the village; orientation anchors early at nexus; one tightening as idea stirs suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Starlight as micro-setting constrains the ritual—"light pooling like mercury in his palm"—and charges final shimmer; sensory details like thickening air integrate purposefully, mirroring internal unveiling without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free the trapped idea escalates accumulatively as hair warms and hums, narrowing to village truth with agency in braiding; cost felt in "they had become the very thing they feared," charging poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truths emerges organically from hair ritual and village backstory fragments, resonating in final image of Elara's smile without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "the village would have to listen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing like "strands hummed with tension"; rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual—"shadows deepening into something almost solid"—without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, info-dense lines like "secrets coiled like smoke" propel without loops; minor figurative density in ritual ("light disorient him") fits accumulative texture but borders overwriting, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith as idea-unlocker transforms trope via hair-as-key and star-ritual, risking metaphorical boldness that heightens stakes inevitably to CR without gimmickry.</comment>
