<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority via object-handling reveals precision-vs-chaos tension; final clock adjustment earns change with embodied grip. Minor slip in label-speak ("uncertainly certain") borders unearned epiphany without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mosaic shards (workshop to otherworld) taught early via compass guidance, causal lens holds with motivated ellipsis to closure. DC/CR lands on-page as clock hums and city falters, reconfiguring time with conceptual cost in rigid figures' pause; orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (oil/rust, mist clinging skin) purposefully narrows under urgency, POV-biased to tinkerer's tactile priorities. Compass and waterfall constrain choices (leads descent, forces step into churn), charging final image; no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty) signaled early via broken objects, tightens accumulatively through compass pulls narrowing precision path. Agency in descent and final adjustment forecloses rigidity with on-page cost (city's faltering rhythm); one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (uncertainty frees precision's trap) emerges organically from symbol accumulation, resonant CR in clock's hum reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like spinning needle shift meaning at end image, inviting ambiguity without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tinkerer-perceptual bias (gears frozen, needle trembling); rhythmic texture modulates from calm description to charged whispers. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, advances recognition; no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm matching intensity (short sentences in mist approach); opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly. Minor template stems ("Elias [action]") in mid-shards, but no loops obscuring closure or artifacts in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer symbols into gateway CR transforms portal trope via object-agency; risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes coherently. Non-obvious pattern (coincidence to freedom) feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
