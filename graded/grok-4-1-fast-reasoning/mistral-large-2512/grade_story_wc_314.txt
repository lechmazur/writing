<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between quantifying wonder and feeling its pulse act in scene via trembling fingers on crystal and kneeling choice; final renunciation of control earned by prior flame reflection with embodied cost of pressing it into earth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as orchard images and reflections density-build to Charged Poise closure; crystal shattering scatters embers into earth as legible conceptual cost of releasing control, with constraint shaping final readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring frozen dew crystals and tree constrain choices (plucking, pressing) and charge final shattering image; sensory details like apple/bees hum and prismatic veil selectively mirror internal fraying of logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing logic/intuition signaled early and deepens accumulatively via crystal-flame link and starlings; agency in kneeling/press peaks with cost in shattering that forecloses control path, charging final step back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unmeasurable magic emerges organically from crystal-flame, starlings patterns, and orchard particulars; final image of scattering embers and weaving birds offers resonant reconfiguration of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in alchemist's pattern-noticing (starlings, crystal swirls); rhythmic prose modulates from tense ("trembling not from cold") to poised ("she smiled") without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating via short sentences at crystal pulse/shatter while vivid images propel to closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist trope via crystal-trapped flame and starling undecipherability transforms control motif into earned letting-go; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
