<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's plant-whispers create contradictory impulses—she ignores them lifelong until unseal compels action; final hand-to-earth with Lina reveals values hierarchy, earning closure choice with Council cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from kite symbols to unseal's Charged Poise, reconfiguring world with legible heresy cost in "The Council would come"; orientation anchors by para 2, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Springs' obsidian cracks and churning water constrain rule-breaking and enable unseal; final "ground hummed" charges closure image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (rebirth vs Council dogma) signaled via off-limits, tightens texturally through whispers/decoding to unseal's trade-off; cost unmistakable in impending judgment felt at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tradition evolves implicitly via unseal into "rebirth," final earth hum reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Council's threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to plant colors/scents; rhythm modulates from coiled reflections to shimmering purpose; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density integrates senses into action (e.g., "water churned, dark and thick as blood"); rhythm varies propulsively to "plants were singing" close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Telepathic plants + kite-embryo destiny synthesizes fresh post-recon frame; risk of plant communion heights stakes inevitably to humming earth.</comment>
