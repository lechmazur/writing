<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Paradoxically steady trait shown in trembling hands yet proceeding with ritual, earning final acceptance of changed bond; contradictory love/letting-go impulses act in tears and forehead press, compelling higher-stakes endurance with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (bird form), with legible cost in "reluctant, painful" twist and tears; single scene anchors early, closure reconfigures bond with felt emotional price in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's perfumed air and glowing fruit constrain ritual via tree proximity and spice grinding, charging final swaying branches; sensory hierarchy (scents over sight) reflects beast-whisperer bias, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled via fortune and ritual, tightens via painful metamorphosis narrowing to acceptance/renunciation; agency in grinding paste and watching forces trade-off, with tears as visible cost charging Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of changed return emerges from fortune reprise and bird image reweighting loss without moral; subtext in wavering form invites ambiguity on endurance's price, resonating via particulars like ember voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scent/perception signature stable in single POV; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Not yet... I will be"), advancing summons; rhythm modulates from murmur to flare without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., paste sizzles into wings); varied rhythm suits lyric build, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density in opening orchard but purposeful, not muddling closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beast-whispering necromancy into phoenix-bond rebirth transforms tropes via spice ritual and painful shift; risk in cosmic intimacy heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from fortune seed.</comment>
