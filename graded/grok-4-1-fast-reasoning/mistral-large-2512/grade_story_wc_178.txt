<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frugal astronomer's motivation roots consistently in hoarding knowledge over gold, compelling the key choice to hand over the tile despite risk; contradictory impulses emerge in trembling finger amid recitation while mercenaries approach. Final renunciation of power for future preservation earns closure with embodied cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like empirical doubt drive the ironic tile's use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to tile activation, figure's challenge, and vision resolving patterns into future map, yielding CR closure in star-mirror image reweighting covenant from unknown to future. Cost legible in tile dissolving to shard as shouts intrude. Orientation anchors immediately in palace entry; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via mercenaries' approaching shouts forcing timed ritual and throne room's silence enabling it; lapis tiles, myrrh, cedar integrate tactilely into stealthy steps and uncloaking. Sensory hierarchy reflects astronomer's priorities (stars over coins). Final image charges with oculus star descending, mirroring evolved palace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to seal bloodless covenant tightens accumulatively: tile glow draws figure's opposition, vision deepens to future reweighting options. Agency in recitation and offering forecloses binding heavens; cost in forfeited relic unmistakably paid on page. No coincidences resolve; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of devotion preserving knowledge amid chaos emerges organically from frugality motif shifting to future covenant; star-mirror offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in figure's "devotion is encrypted" layers via image, not statement. Complexity lingers in ironic relic's loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: star/astronomy bias filters details (constellations in tile). Voice modulates rhythmically from whispered steps to pulsing glow; dialogue subtextual ("I seek only to understand") advances goal. No head-hopping; diction controlled, era-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "numbers glowed faintly, pulsing in time with his heartbeat" advances plot/embodies emotion); rhythm varies for tension. Minor figurative density ("like a god’s breath") in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays in closure vision without muddling peak. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms Babylonian tropes via empirically ironic tile decoding stars into future covenant; risk in dusky lyric voice heightens mystical stakes. Final shard recharges frugality motif inevitably. No template echoes; bold reimagining commits fully.</comment>
