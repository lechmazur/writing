<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied contradictions like hollow artistry versus fragile orb sketch driving micro-choices; final readiness earned by causal buildup of thawing metaphors. Thoughtfully spirited trait shown through curious narration under self-imposed pressure. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses frozen isolation with felt vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and activations builds to CR closure in "He was ready to shape something new," reweighting frozen barriers with undeniable conceptual cost of exposure. Single scene, early orientation (control room, Elias, melting ice by para 2). No shards or ambiguity; persistent thaw constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (rust smell, dripping taps as metronome, dusty switches) filter through glassblower's fragile-lens POV, constraining refuge choices and charging final whirring activation. Ice evolution mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (console, panel) tethers action; recurring melt charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw barriers for inquiry) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via journal abandonment and narrated calibration narrowing frozen options. Agency in switch-flips forces stance crystallization; cost legible in fragility embrace. One tightening (realization "cracks were where the light got in") reweights without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cracks admitting light emerges organically from glass/orb motifs and thaw images, culminating in non-literal final answer via machine chorus against melting ice. Resonance reweights prior hollow craft without moralizing; ambiguity in readiness invites reflection. Protagonist arc inextricable from inquiry safe zones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (artistic whispers, creases, refractions); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective breath-fog to epic narration. Self-dialogue goal-driven, subtext-rich; no head-hopping or withholding. Diction biased toward fragility, consistent under rising resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short clicks amid flowing reflections); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—similes like "dying bees" purposeful and sparse. Propulsion builds via integrated action/image; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower in control room fuses industrial relics with personal thaw, transforming introspection tropes via narrated activation and bookmark as flawed holder. Risky epic tone on mundane elevates; turns inevitable from established metaphors. Non-obvious control room as inquiry forge heightens ingenuity.</comment>
