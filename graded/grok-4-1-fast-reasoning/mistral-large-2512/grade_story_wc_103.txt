<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices under pressure—pressing the shard to the photo then to her mother—reveal a hierarchy of values with embodied cost, earning the final endurance. Interiority concrete and particular, like gasping at the reversing image. Mild weakness: initial motivation leans told via backstory summary before inciting test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from fading photos to warped moment, pattern break in mother's disintegration, CR closure via restored images and Elara's touched-back aging ("She was older now, but not in the way of years"). Orientation anchored early; shards transition legibly via garden guidance. Cost legible in final willow cradle image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden constrains choices (hedges guide, roots doorway) and charges final image (roots cradling, leaves quaking). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: time's texture via pulsing shard, damp air, whispering trees. No white-room; hyperbolic warp integrates purposefully without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore fading past) signaled early, tightens texturally via failed photo test narrowing to desperate press on mother. Agency in disintegration forecloses path with cost (fragment gone, personal aging). Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient; cost unmistakable in waking change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time's inescapable touch emerges organically from particulars: reversing photo, street echoes, final "touched her back." Resonant non-literal answer in garden's humming reverie reweights premise without moralizing. Final image recharges motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: time-vine metaphors bias noticing ("vines, and where the air hummed"). Voice rhythmic, modulates to compression at climax ("silence"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: "You shouldn’t be here" layers grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "petals curled inward, grin melted into scream" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative purposeful under reverie tone. Minor register elevation fits designerly lexicon, no muddle at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive halo in living maze transforms time tropes via garden's memory. Risky warped-moment shard heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: fragment's pulse foreshadows personal cost.</comment>
