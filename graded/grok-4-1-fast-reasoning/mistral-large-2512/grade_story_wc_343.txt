<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's diligence drives micro-choices like tracing charts and noting the hopscotch irregularities, earning his master's approval with visible excitement cost in shaking hands; minor slip in limited contradictory impulses keeps it from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern observations (birds, phrasebook, board) build to CR closure via lantern reveal reweighting the airship as compass; on-page cost legible in "hands shaking with excitement," one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains discovery choice and charges lantern image; sensory details (ozone, dust, brass glow) selective via Elias's priorities, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earn sigil via discovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through board pattern to lantern payoff narrowing options to follow uncharted wind; agency in noting/ presenting with felt diligence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden paths in patterns emerges organically from starling-board-lantern chain, final starlings guiding reweights premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing bias; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’ve been diligently curious, boy"), voice modulates rhythmically without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short "His breath hitched" amid descriptives); no loops/artifacts, metaphors purposeful ("ink in water") without muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-cipher synthesizing starlings and "stranded luminance" feels inevitable/fresh; risk in cipher premise heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
