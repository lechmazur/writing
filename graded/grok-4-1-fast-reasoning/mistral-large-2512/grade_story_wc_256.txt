<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" roots consistently in traits like calloused fingers and ritual invention, earning the final shift from control to listening; embodied conflict peaks in vibrations "sync[ing] with his pulse." Minor early summaries slightly abstract pressure before the inciting hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered ritual build to wall hum; CR closure lands on-page in "the texture of connection wasn’t something to be discovered," reweighting premise with conceptual cost felt in the glowing lens image. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via independent vibration suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miner’s carbide lamp lens as micro-setting recurs to constrain realization ("pressed his palm") and charge final image ("glowing faintly in his hand"). Sensory details like "low, resonant hum" filter through Elias's sonic bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early tightens texturally when hum "fills the spaces between his ribs like a second heartbeat," narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in palm-pressing yields felt cost in premise shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherent connection emerges via sound layers without statement; final CR reweights "discover" premise non-literally through lamp image, embracing ambiguity in "waiting for the future to arrive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with sonic perceptual signature ("sound could split into something beautiful"); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to insistent hum; brief dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "fingers...traced the curve"); varied rhythm propels accumulatively without loops or muddled metaphors; minor figurative density in reflections purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic lab/prism bells transforms preservation trope into textural pilgrimage; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via lamp reprise.</comment>
