<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief (hollows of bones) and micro-choices ("Show me") reveal contradictory impulses acting in scene; final endurance earned by prior pulses and loss. Ghost applies brief crucible pressure. 9+ test passed cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via geode pulses to Charged Poise closure ("heat searing her skin"; trembling observatory reconfigures hunt with cost). Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circuit breakers and fractured dome constrain timing/escape, charge final image (groaning bones); sensory selective via urgency (hissing heat, scraping metal). Mirrors internal cracks poetically. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tap potential) signaled early, deepens via ghost revelation narrowing to personal wreckage; agency in confrontation forces run with searing cost. Accumulative escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grief-as-potential emerges via geode shifts; final image ("back to the fire") reweights premise non-literally without moral. Recurring veins/pulses charge closure organically. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with grief-biased perceptual signature (wilting roses to charred lace); rhythmic texture modulates intensity. Sparse dialogue ("Show me") goal-driven, subtext-rich. 9+ test passed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy alarms vs. flowing pulses); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures (sky split open) propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks at "hunt...begun."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh geode-grief synthesis transforms apocalypse tropes; perturbation infuses poetically. Risky ghost poise inevitable from pulses; no hedging, bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
