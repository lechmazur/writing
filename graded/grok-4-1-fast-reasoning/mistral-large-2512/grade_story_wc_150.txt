<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "warmly curious hum settled in my chest" and embodied struggle ("hands blistered... back aching"), rooting motivation to restore faith; micro-choices like prying slabs reveal values. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits peak complexity, but final recognition feels earned without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries density-build to central chamber tightening, with on-page RR closure ("bones... bloomed into new roots") reconfiguring faith; cost legible in "weight of twenty years lift" after journey toll. Orientation anchored early in Varethis docking; no ambiguity, persistent constraint of relic shapes tactics to finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective ("roots coiled around skeletal fingers," "damp earth and... myrrh"), filters through POV urgency, constrains choices (cramped tunnels, roots guide); charges closure as "orchard sighed... branches creaking." Micro-setting (pomegranate trees, bones mosaic) indispensable without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discovery deepening to chamber placement; agency in excavating forecloses doubt path with embodied cost (blisters, aches). One meaningful tightening suffices; cost unmistakable in lifted weight post-tremble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (roots as faith metaphor, sundial shadow on bones); final image ("new roots, tender and green") offers non-literal resonant answer to restoration without moralizing. Subtext in "not resurrecting the past, but... tending," avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature ("roots... threads in a tapestry"); rhythmic prose modulates (short punches in digs, lyrical awe at "robes woven from sunlight and shadow"). Voice texture purposeful for enchantment; single dialogue line natural, goal-subtle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels ("light spilled... bleeding like ink"), rhythm varies with scene (groaning stone to trembling chamber); minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("wound in the earth," "alive with frescoes") purposeful for textural lens but nudges from peak. Zero loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard as living library transforms graveyard trope; "sundial... casting shadow on upturned faces" inflects uniquely to closure bloom. Risky enchanted realism coheres without gimmick, memorable diaspora-faith angle.</comment>
