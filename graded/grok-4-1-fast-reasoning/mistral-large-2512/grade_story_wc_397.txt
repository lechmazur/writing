<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's embodied sensations like "skin felt thinner" and contradictory impulses (seeking personal endings yet finding solace in others') culminate in the earned clipboard choice, foreclosing tourist detachment with felt cost. Minor early passivity doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of ice sounds and breath rattles tightening to Charged Poise CR at "didn’t feel like a tourist anymore," with legible cost in reconfigured stance. Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina's groaning stilts and thawing floes constrain movement and mirror internal thaw; parasol tip as micro-setting charges dying man's smile and final tuck. Sensory hierarchy (wet rattle pinnacle) reflects Elias's sound-stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hear endings accumulates via tent rattle to woman’s clipboard handoff, narrowing detachment option with visible endurance cost in final dock image. One deepening suffices under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip's reprise from grandmother's storm fragment to man's "catching the wind" reweights endings premise non-literally, emerging as windborne solace without moralizing. Complexity lingers in tourist-to-helper shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in sound/texture bias ("wet rattle... most beautiful"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re one of them"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "pebbles dragged across a frozen shore"); varied rhythm propels to crisp closure line. No loops or artifacts; purposeful figures like "pocket of patience" cohere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with ice-collapse relief transforms death-witness trope via parasol's windborne evolution; risk in Accumulative sound-stake heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
