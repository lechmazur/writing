<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's reluctance and guilt ("heavy and unyielding") drive contradictory impulses, embodied in pocketing the nut unthinkingly then realizing its map potential for indirect aid. Final micro-choice to point without touching earns stasis with curse's ongoing cost. Secondary man pressures her via scream, revealing her hierarchy of values. 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice earned by causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density builds from orchard tending to blueprint/nut realization to frost-tightened scattering and man's desperate arrival. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in exhale and silvered leaves reconfigures curse endurance with felt cost ("holds for another night"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no debt. Cost legible in final image of unripe fruit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring trees/nuts and frost constrain choices (scatter before frost, birds patrol) and charge final image (silvering leaves, heavy unripe fruit). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: bark warmth, pulsing nut, brass glint under Mira's tactile tending. Details evolve causally (damp soil to creeping frost). 9+ test: elements constrain and charge end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curse balance: spare one life) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via nut-map realization narrowing to subtle hints before frost. Man's scream/manoeuvers force stance crystallization; agency in pointing forecloses direct aid with cost (curse persists). Escalation coherent under lens, cost unmistakable in birds' dive and exhale. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of graceless endurance/balance emerges organically from nut breadcrumbs and indirect salvation, reweighted in final image of unyielding trees without moralizing. Subtext in "impressions without touching" implies detachment's cost. Resonance from particulars avoids binaries. Minor slip: ambiguity lingers strongly but counter-readings slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (bark/rough comparisons, embodied frost breath). Rhythm modulates: short tense sentences in bird dive ("shrieking, diving"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Follow the nuts"). 9+ test: signature and control under pressure, no slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "gnarled roots twisting through cracks" advances setting/motif/causality). No loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (gripping roots, heavy stone guilt). Rhythm propels: varies from lyrical opens to clipped climax. 9+ test: zero issues, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cursed orchard + mechanical birds + nut-maps transform tropes via precise indirectness. Risk in shard structure/non-touch method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight (blueprint echoes nut). No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity to graceless closure.</comment>
