<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unravel the locket's secrets through intuitive listening drives consistent micro-choices, like not opening the locket or approaching Clara, culminating in earned stasis at "listening was enough." Interiority feels particular in "the part of her that had learned to hear the unspoken." Contradictory impulses act in holding back during the dawn scene, revealing values with visible emotional cost to Clara.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density builds from locket/mailbox jiggle to neighborhood fragments, tightening via dawn *click* to Charged Poise closure where Clara's "shoulders shaking" makes healing cost legible. Orientation anchors early in courtyard/thrift role. No lens ambiguity; persistent mailbox constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard details like "light pooling in the cracks" and rusted mailbox constrain choices (drawn there, tested lock) and charge final image of held breath. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's perceptual bias toward unspoken sounds. Micro-setting (mailbox) evolves causally, mirroring internal quiet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel mailbox mystery via listening) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through clue deepening to witnessing Clara's release, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Agency in patient observation forecloses intrusion path with felt relational cost in Clara's tremble. One meaningful cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening's healing emerges organically from neighborhood fragments to final "quiet healing," reweighting initial intrusion hum without moralizing. Closing image of "sandstorm calm" offers non-literal resonance to central question of unspoken stories' power. Complexity lingers in Lila's implied tragedy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in auditory bias ("hear the unspoken," *click*). Voice texture via lyrical rhythm ("honey, thick and golden") modulates purposefully to charged poise. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "light... pooling" advances atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; metaphors coherent/selective, no muddle or loops in peak dawn beat. Propulsion peaks crisply at "courtyard held its breath."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator's intuitive listening transforms mailbox mystery trope into textural healing arc. "Sandstorm calm" ending risks quiet reconfiguration without gimmick. Particular details like cinnamon rolls/Morenos avoid generics; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
