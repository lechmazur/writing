<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to learn repair rhythm drives entry into mirrors despite fear, with embodied hesitation ("avoided it for years") yielding to micro-choice of kneeling and arranging. Final realization as "bridge" earned via prior avoidance and gear whispers, foreclosing evasion with conceptual cost. Lacks sharper contradictory impulses in peak beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gear arrangement to turning and visions, culminating in on-page CR ("He was not just a locksmith; he was a bridge") with legible conceptual cost of scattered consciousness and remembering. Orientation anchored early (Elias in library under dawn). Single scene/shard fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirrors as setting constrain choices by revealing possibilities, charging final image of world past/future and gear rhythm. Sensory details (parchment/frost smell, shimmering oil) selective via POV urgency, integrated into action (tracing spines, gears catching light). Recurrent gears/mirrors evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair rhythm) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mirror visions narrowing knowledge to clockmaker's trap and Elias's role. Agency in deliberate gear placement/listening forces CR reconfiguration with felt cost of memory's burden. One decisive deepening suffices; no live option foreclosed beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair as remembering emerges organically from gear visions and final realization, reweighting premise without statement. Mirrors/gears motif shifts from puzzle to consciousness fragments, charging CR with thematic resonance. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in Elias's "bridge" role lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "metallic whispers," "hues of silver and blue"). Voice texture modulates poetically from nostalgic setup to intensified visions, rhythmic control heightens pressure in gear-turning beat. No elision or head-hopping; perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task (e.g., "gears began to turn... mirrors flickered" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (e.g., oil as "captured sunlight"). Zero scaffold in closure beat sustains clarity/momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar locksmith repairing time-gears via prophecy mirrors transforms tropes into organic premise. Final CR ("rhythm of repair... about remembering") inevitable from gear calls/prophecies. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
