<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's embodied listening ("hum... into Elias’s bones") and persistent tuning despite personal silence reveal contradictory endurance; final eyes-closed poise earns preservation with melting cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds resonance from first fading song to brighter second; charged poise closure in "lattice of sapphire" reconfigures wonder with undeniable melt/winter cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment as micro-setting constrains balance ("bit into his fingers") and charges final image by melting/freezing into lattice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to preserve wonder deepens texturally from fading first song to orb-shatter intensification, foreclosing easy stasis with visible iceberg shrinkage and mute winter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silent tuning answers fading wonder non-literally via final brighter song; reweights colors from lost ("fading... in the eyes") to preserved lattice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("silence... full of sound") biases noticing toward resonance; rhythmic modulation fits mute tuner's texture under wind pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in sculpture beats ("spun silver and hollow reeds... pivot just so"); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor "sang" echo purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-plucked iceberg tuned via toy-shatter into symphony transforms mute preservation boldly; inevitable hindsight from mentor's "tune it until it remembers."</comment>
