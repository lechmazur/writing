<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's dreamless trait and immunity to whispers motivate his bold step into the dune, creating embodied tension that earns the closure shift to expanded duty; internal conflict emerges in bone-vibration hesitation before archive acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dune hum and clock touch build density to archive shard, yielding CR closure when pocketing the clock reconfigures purpose with felt responsibility cost; two-shard structure legible, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glowing dune petals and infinite shelves constrain choices via humming pull and cold glass trigger; archive's relics (shoe, watch, letter) charge final pocketed-clock image, filtering through Elias's guard bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cargo guarding deepens accumulatively to time-mending via voice/archive pressure, narrowing options to acceptance; pocketed clock crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable duty-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractures emerges organically from relic shelves and spark-cultivation voice, reweighted non-literally in final train-rumble image tying past burns to present guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (dust boots, bone hums) biases sensory hierarchy to guard's tactile world; rhythmic modulation peaks in fractured-voice whispers without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varying rhythm; no loops or artifacts dull closure—ozone/paper scent and spinning hands advance cleanly without overwriting in peak archive beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chess-clock portal to divergent archive synthesizes post-apocalyptic guard duty with quantum-time mending in non-obvious, inevitable arc; risk-taking in "occasionally everywhere" spatiality heightens stakes organically.</comment>
