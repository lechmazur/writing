<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and imagination drive concrete micro-choices like tracing cracks and following subtle breadcrumbs despite doubt, earning her descent. Contradictory impulses act in scene (disbelief vs. pull of absence) and final step forecloses fear path with felt tremble. Minor slip: trait labels like "luminous skeptic" slightly overt, but actions reveal under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumb pattern density builds to key turn unlocking basin, spiraling to light-filled room as CR reweighting trapped memories premise. Orientation anchored early (fountains, box at dawn). Closure cost legible in "ground shuddered" and descent into "darkness," reconfiguring options with undeniable relief/regret scent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forgotten fountains constrain path and charge climax (leaves hide lock, basin splits). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Elara notices cracks/moss signaling absence, body slick on stairs. Final room light evolves setting causally, mirroring internal unstickking; micro-object (key) enables choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled via box/date, tightens accumulatively through apparition reveal narrowing to key descent. Agency in pressing key despite tremble forecloses inaction with ground-shudder cost. Escalation coherent under lens: pattern break at unlocking forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memories as dragging anchors emerges organically from box, whispers, unstick directive; final light image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence into presence without moral. Subtext in grandmother's flicker/sad smile invites ambiguity on loss. No direct statement; complexity in Elara's fear vs. relief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (world-reading via cracks/shadows); voice rhythmic, diction biased to luminous imagery modulating to hush at apparition. Dialogue subtextual ("You’re late" tests expectation, "What do I do?" reveals vulnerability). No head-hopping; compression purposeful, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "fingers tracing cracks... moss surrendered to dust" advances setting/character/mood). Rhythm varies, no loops; figurative coherent (jagged constellations pattern-taught). Minor density in opening metaphors doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-grandmother via subtle breadcrumbs in dry-fountain city transforms memory trope into tactile unstickking quest. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes (e.g., date as "pause of migrating geese"); inevitable hindsight from box-to-light arc.</comment>
