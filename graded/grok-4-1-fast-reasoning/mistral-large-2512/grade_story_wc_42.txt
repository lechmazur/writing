<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to harness the ephemeral intensifies via micro-choices like prying the chronometer under shakes; embodied in trembling fingers and luminous ache. Limited contradictory impulses—ignores escalating danger too smoothly—prevent higher score, but endurance earned in clutching photo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds imagery density (spin, light, shakes) to CR closure: photo's burning streak reprices escape velocity as threshold, cost legible in "observatory crumble" and pod ejection. One tightening via recurring foundations shakes narrows options; pattern taught early, holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tools (camera, chronometer) constrain restructure choice; recurring clock hand and lens reflection charge final image as "silent witness." Sensory selection urgent (fogged breath, dying hum) reflects POV priorities; spatial choreography coherent amid lurch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture vision signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shakes forcing infinite exposure agency; one reversal narrows to escape. Cost unmistakable in violent lurch and descent foreclosing observatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral-to-eternal emerges organically via photo trail reweighting light/time; final pod image offers resonant non-literal answer ("time itself spinning free") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (leaf sound as revelation, moon indifferent); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to whirring shutter without head-hopping or leakage. Close-third stable, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax; rhythm breathes in shake escalations. Figurative density overwrites restructure beat ("wheel of potential, infinite exposure") without full pattern payoff, docking from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-hand shutter capturing visible escape velocity transforms sci-fi tropes; poetic risks (leaf sound epiphany) heighten stakes organically to charged CR closure.</comment>
