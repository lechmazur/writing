<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied reactions like pulse quickening and steady breath under pressure; motivation to chase truths feels consistent and intensifies to mirror confrontation. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("serene upheaval") borders on unearned label-speak without full contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in mirror recognition; orientation anchored early at dock/canal. Cost legible in final self-repricing image ("as he might have been—had he not spent his life chasing shadows"); single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp wood, salt/parchment smell, creaking barge) filters through seeker's priorities, constraining choices like boarding/prying. Sundial and mirror as micro-settings charge final image; barge stillness mirrors internal hush effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-seeking signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sundial spin and mirror figure to agency in lifting mirror. One tightening at reflection's speech narrows to self-truth; cost felt in foreclosed chase-life path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-as-lie emerges organically from particulars like warped reflection and sundial reorientation; final image reweights prior pursuit without moralizing. Resonance in "the lies might be looking back at him" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (instinct-parsing gaps, symbol-noticing); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at end. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful without muddle (e.g., "paint peeling like old skin"). Minor template echoes in reflective stems ("he had spent") but no loops touching closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seeker trope via self-reflective mirror/sundial; risk in surreal barge labyrinth heightens stakes organically. Transformation evident in hindsight repricing of lifelong chase.</comment>
