<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's colorblindness creates embodied conflict between precision and feeling, culminating in earned shift at "didn’t fear the blank canvas." Liora's cunning grin compels risky deal; Mara's shard reveals supportive pressure. Minor slip in generic "pulse quickened" but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: awakening images (jasmine, shard, canvas) build density to CR closure where Elias reconfigures sight as "different kind," with cost of renouncing forced precision legible in final brush dip. Plant arrangement tightens as one meaningful deepening. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene with time elision coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard's molten silica/jasmine constrain choices (plant spiral, reed use); glass shard as micro-setting charges final spectrum image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory bias (Elias's touch/memory over hues) selective and POV-specific. No white-room; evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture felt color) signaled early, tightens via Liora's deal narrowing to "feel" painting; agency in arrangement forecloses precision path with Mara's softening response. Cost felt in jasmine wither/recurrence; under Accumulative lens, pattern break reweights imperfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of dormant beauty/imperfection emerges via jasmine unfurl/cracks light, reweighted non-literally in final "painted the color of awakening." No moralizing; counter-reading in withering adds ambiguity. Closure image offers resonant answer without thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual signature (unseen hues via touch); voice rhythmic, modulates to charged poise at end. Dialogue subtextual (Liora's "price," Mara's shard handoff pursues goals). No head-hopping; diction biased to artist's envy/certainty lack.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "jasmine trembled" advances sensory/awakening); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts in peak beats. Final line recharges cobalt motif propulsively. Minor overwriting in metaphors but coherent, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (reed awakenings, plant code) transforms colorblind trope via tactility/feeling; phoenix shard risks bold alchemy without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight in courtyard helix humming as organic crescendo.</comment>
