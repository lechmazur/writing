<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied details like the "finger that trembled—not from cold, but from the residue of fever," rooting his guilt-driven motivation; contradictory fear of mistakes versus freeing uncertainty acts in scene via descent despite doubt. Final renunciation of prophecy's weight feels earned through causal chain to photo/note. Minor slip: reflective blocks slightly exceed BRR without always tilting present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure—"weight... grounding," reconfiguring oracle burden with legible emotional cost in final breath. Orientation anchored early (station, post-fever Elias); shards transition legibly from illustration to clearing to dawn return. One tightening via flower match narrows to dig site payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station and mountain constrain descent choice amid wind; valley "like a bruise" and dawn light charge final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (groaning metal, biting cold) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog. Recurrent pack/tools enable tactile navigation; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth swallowed guilt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via illustration→flower→box, forcing endurance of past with agency in kneeling/digging. Cost legible in "stone in his chest" resolved to grounding weight. Enters 8+ via trade-off at realization; minor abstractness in initial prophecy fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence over perfect foresight emerges organically from particulars (wrong prediction, unearthed note); final image ("breathed without... weight") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting fragments without moralizing. Subtext in swaying trees/erroneous landslide avoids binaries. No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature biased to prophetic margins ("future in fragments, like... rippling water"); diction/rhythm modulate from feverish unease to dawn poise. Purposeful compression taught early pays in charged closure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice distinct without dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "petals like shattered glass" advances mystery/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphor cluster ("auroral sorrow of dawn") coheres but borders muddle in reflective beats. Closure image crisp, zero artifacts there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle transforms prophecy trope via imprecise visions freeing from guilt; illustration-to-box arc feels inevitable synthesis. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; fresh "swallowed truth" calculus personalizes redemption.</comment>
