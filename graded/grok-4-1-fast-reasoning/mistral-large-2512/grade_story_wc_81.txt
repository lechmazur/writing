<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied reactions culminate in earned realization at "Veyne. The same name as his," compelling reclamation with felt personal cost; motivation rooted in job-specific traits drives micro-choices without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through knowledge-deepening discoveries to on-page CR closure ("the past was indexing him") with conceptual cost legible in final inheritance reweighting; single scene anchors orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged library's saltwater-slick books and dappled light constrain searches and charge final lantern-flicker image, filtered through Elias's perceptual priorities for vivid, purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) signaled early tightens via ledger discovery narrowing knowledge/options under accumulative lens, with agency in persistent search yielding visible conceptual cost at heritage reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming buried truths emerges organically from stamp-ledger arc to resonant final image ("truth had always been waiting"), reweighting inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (logical indexing of details) and rhythmic modulation under realization pressure; purposeful diction sustains texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory action; minor overwrite in "tranquility... a choice, a reclaiming" doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken-library heritage quest transforms relic trope through specific crest-ledger payoff, risking quiet CR for deepened stakes.</comment>
