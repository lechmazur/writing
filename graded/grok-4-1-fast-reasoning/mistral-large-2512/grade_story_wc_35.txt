<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's hand-squeeze despite the "prickle," earning the shared dilution of grief; Kael's hollow eyes and twitch reveal festering flaws that compound until her intervention. Interiority particular via tasting salt/regret; voice distinct in sparse dialogue. Final endurance forecloses isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of tactile memories tightens to RR closure in warming coral pulse, reconfiguring grief as "promise" with emotional cost legible in lighter memories. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (fortress, Maren, rain). Single scene coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coral pavilion constrains choices (palm analysis, final pulse) and charges ending image, shifting from frozen relic to warm promise. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Maren notices tidal formations and salt sting amid urgency. Atmosphere mirrors internal tide/grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (subdue contagious grief) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via two touches narrowing options (endure remorse or withdraw); agency in deliberate squeezes forecloses submersion with dilution cost felt on-page. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise at threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-as-tide theme emerges organically from tidal pools, contagious touches, and final warm coral repricing submersion as carried promise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications (Kael's "What if I want to?"); resonant non-literal closure reweights particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (taste/salt motifs bias noticing); voice rhythmic, modulating from sturdy descriptions to hitched breaths under stress. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("Grief isn’t a monument"), distinct idiom; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "his sorrow was emotionally contagious through touch—one brush...drowning" advances stakes/embodies). Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor metaphor density ("teeth and claws") in low-pressure opener, but peak clean—no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, touch-contagion grief, desert-sea relic transforms tropes; coral's warm pulse inevitable from tidal grief-pattern. Bold risk in surreal pavilion pays off in conceptual closure without gimmickry.</comment>
