<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in planting the seed despite knowing its truth-demand, embodied in "Pain flared... but she did not pull away," earning the final stasis of living with exposed guilt; flaws like kin-raiders complicate without hedging; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with irrefutable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density builds to CR closure in mirror's bone-polished truth and child's knife, reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchors crisply by para 2; seed-tendril-causal chain tightens once meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-rimed mud, glistening fruit "like wet teeth," and thawing lake constrain planting and charge final mirror image; sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to tactile cold/pain; details evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lift curse via truth-feeding seed) signaled early, escalates via accumulating revelations narrowing to confession, forcing endurance-agency with visible cost in trembling hands and reconfigured options; lens-driven deepening unmistakable in "I let them die."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Buried guilt theme emerges organically from seed's unraveling and mirror's non-literal answer (abandoned child grown vengeful), reweighting loyalty/premise without moralizing; subtext layers in silence around kin-raiders; ambiguity lingers meaningfully in vortex's sigh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward buried secrets ("truths that refused to stay hidden"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in short, pained sentences during tendril latch; purposeful compression of memories interleaves without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The seed pulsed... warm despite the frost" advances plot/foreshadows); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (branches "like a living thing," fruit "wet teeth") without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lie-detecting flesh-eater and bone-mirror CR transforms druid tropes via kin-guilt calculus; risk in psychological fantasy depth feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, bold premise commitment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
