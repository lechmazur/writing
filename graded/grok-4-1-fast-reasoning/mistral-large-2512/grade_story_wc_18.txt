<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in breathing sync ("his own lungs syncing to the rhythm without thought") reveals contradictory impulses of practicality vs. mystic pull; summit realization earns change via trust, foreclosing possession with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from hum to summit hold; CR closure in "glass mountain dissolved... sextant whole" reconfigures boundaries with conceptual cost of loneliness, on-page legible; orientation anchored early in cottage/fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass mountain and fog constrain climb/path choices ("fog parting just enough") and charge final dissolution image; sensory hierarchy (breath anchoring, glass singing) reflects POV priorities without catalog; micro-setting irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled by hum, tightens accumulatively via breathing sync narrowing to summit hold; agency in climb/match rhythm forecloses solo practicality with thinner-air cost; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trust-erasing loneliness emerges organically from particulars (dream tremble, light hold); summit image non-literally answers possession premise, reweighting shards/mirrors with ambiguity; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature on reflections/shards ("shards of glass he used to recreate"); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity (short summit breaths); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("exhale sent ripples"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density in climb ("wind through chimes") purposeful without muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant-breath mends dream-loneliness via glass mountain of wishes; risk in surreal climb heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from orchard shards to summit trust.</comment>
