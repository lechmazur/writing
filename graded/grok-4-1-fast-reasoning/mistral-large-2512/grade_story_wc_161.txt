<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map his fractured past via dust motes shows concrete interiority and contradictory impulses (running vs. preserving), earning the final choice to stay. Lena applies relational pressure via discoveries, forcing micro-choices. Backstory block on fire/musicologist anchors present without flattening; voice distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (ledger, lyric sheet) deepen patterns toward Charged Poise closure where Elias chooses to stay, reconfiguring running with felt cost ("He made his choice."). Single scene, orientation anchored early in attic. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in meteorite/pigeon final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting (warped floorboards, skylight dust motes) constrains balance and charges final swirling image, mirroring internal convergence. Sensory details selective via Elias's priorities (paper scent as ruin/resurrection). Recurrent meteorite handled tactilely evolves with revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct lost songs/past vs. running) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing to stay-or-go. Agency in choice forecloses running path with on-page cost (relational/identity trade-off). Pressure coheres under textural lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of lost echoes surviving via paper trails emerges organically from particulars (dust orbits, meteorite, ledger), resonant in final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Lena's quote-speech tensions skepticism/trust. Earned via struggle, invites ambiguity on homecoming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (motes as worlds/stories); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Graphs don’t breathe"), advances stakes; distinct idioms (Lena's quotes vs. Elias's poetic). No head-hopping; elision of past paid in present reveals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Figurative language purposeful (dust "tiny world[s], each path a story") without muddle in peak (final choice). Selective overwriting absent; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ex-musicologist as pigeon trainer mapping dust motes transforms preservation trope via meteorite/paper trails. Risks lyric accumulative texture paying off in quiet Charged Poise. No template echoes; details particular (Lament of Hollow Men).</comment>
