<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between rigid control and flexibility act via foam observation and notebook scribbling; final renunciation of old research earned by causal buildup of regrets with embodied emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening at foam insight; CR closure in notebook plan and "map" image reconfigures path with legible grief cost in "letting the grief loosen its grip."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>River foam and chrysalis constrain insight choice and charge final notebook beat; sensory details (moss, pine, foam spirals) mirror internal states through chemist-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Foam insight deepens dominant atonement stake under accumulative lens, narrowing to adaptive polymers; agency in realization forecloses rigid path with on-page regret cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chrysalis/river images shift from hollow regret to resilient map, resonantly answering separation theme without moral; earned from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chemist perceptual signature in foam equations and polymer sketches distinct; rhythmic modulation builds to insight without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/metaphor propulsion; minor reflection synonym echoes ("separation") but closure image clear and unmarred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>River foam as polymer epiphany freshly synthesizes science/nature for atypical insight; risks heavy reflection but coheres to charged close.</comment>
