<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as failed guardian drives consistent micro-choices like following driftwood and entering the tear, with interior contradiction in his sealing obsession resolved by weaving realization. Embodied emotion strong in trembling fingers and painful flute warmth. Minor slip: reflective backstory block ("his father had been the last true guardian") tilts present but borders BRR 20% cap without enough micro-choice anchors, slightly flattening peak agency at revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: uncasing flute → shimmering path → cavern note widens tear → figure revelation → melody stitches worlds, with on-page CR closure as jagged tear smooths into thread, cost felt in foreclosed sealing path and released silence. Orientation anchored early in Thunder-echo Range post-guardianship. Single tightening at "It is meant to weave" narrows options decisively. Structure fits continuous scene progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: damp earth sinking boots, cavern's damp stone/older smell, other side's twisted light/shifting shadows constrain path and charge flute's evolving warmth/pain. Driftwood markers as micro-setting guide choices across worlds. Canyon hush mirrors internal shift from avalanching quiet to released breath in final image. POV bias filters details through relic-keeper priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest insights/mend failure) signaled early, tightens causally at figure's "boundary was never a wall—it was a thread," forcing weave renunciation with painful warmth cost and foreclosed prior efforts. Agency in following markers/playing melody drives escalation. One reversal sufficient; visible price in fading driftwood alters tactics to new pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of weaving vs. sealing emerges organically from flute use, driftwood rearrangement, and tear-stitching, reweighting guardianship premise in final smooth-edged image without moralizing. Subtext in figure dialogue implies guardians' forgotten truth. Resonance from particulars like glowing flute avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in held breath release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in relic-focused noticing (flute symbols, driftwood patterns). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from heavy silence to winding melody cadence. Dialogue sparse/natural with subtext ("You are not a guardian"); figure's canyon-wind idiom distinct. No head-hopping; distance tightens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines like "air swirled like water" advance atmosphere/action. Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences at tear entry, flowing melody description). Minor overwriting in opening simile stack ("avalanchingly quiet stillness that pressed... like a held breath") borders mixed metaphors but doesn't obscure causality. No loops/artifacts; clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh twist transforms guardian trope: relic flute weaves worlds as thread, not seals wall, grown from driftwood markers and other-side chamber. Synthesis of fantasy elements feels organic via causal discovery. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens thematic stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; particular hush motif inflects uniquely.</comment>
