<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's earnestly naive traits constrain his fire-averse mending and compel persistence, earning the realization that imperfection suffices; contradictory impulses between weak magic and cosmic ambition act in scene without labels dominating. Final endurance of imbalance forecloses perfectionism with felt cost in brittle laugh. Minor abstract interiority ("brittle devotion") slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from drip observation to mended ring parting mist, delivering Conceptual Repricing in "rebuilding wasn’t about perfection" line—reweights premise from fulcrum-fix to imperfect holding, with undeniable cost of world's persistent tilt. Orientation anchors crisply by para 2; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's leaks supply water and dripping rates as micro-setting constraining mending angle/timing, charging closure via rhythm-match that enables ring; sensory selection (salt taste, humming arches) filters through Elias's naive priorities, evolving causally to mist-parting. POV bias shapes familiarity, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic balance via bell) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through drip-calibrated mending narrowing to imperfect ring with fish-ripple payoff; agency in timing micro-choices forecloses rust/forgetting paths with tactical costs, coherent pressure to Charged Poise. Partial success tests commitment without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect rebuilding emerges organically from bell-mending particulars, final image of ripple laughter reconfiguring "right a cosmic imbalance" from perfection to listening endurance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in tilting world, resonant non-literal answer via broken note's raw weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature—poetic bias toward cracks/drips as cosmic signs—modulates rhythmically under process stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ring image, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers tracing the cracks... spilled ink" advances setting/action/mood); varied rhythm survives read-aloud, syntax purposeful for texture. Figurative density high but pattern-consistent without muddle or loops dulling closure; minor scaffold in repeated "silence" phrasing contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of naive mage mending via dripping rates transforms end-of-world trope through viaduct-bell logic, inevitable in hindsight; risk in plausible impossibility tone heightens stakes without gimmick, no derivative echoes.</comment>
