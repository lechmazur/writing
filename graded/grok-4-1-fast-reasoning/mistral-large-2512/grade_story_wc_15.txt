<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied details like trembling hands and pulse as drumbeat; motivation to carve path from ruin intensifies credibly to loom choice. Minor flaw: epiphany at "broken precedents" feels slightly unearned without deeper prior contradiction. Final weaving earned by cumulative micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from footprints/needle to loom; orientation anchored early in canyon/tide pools. Closure as RR (labyrinth sighs, footprints vanish) lands on-page with conceptual cost of self-integration legible in "letting it sew her into its story." One tightening via voice's "sewing the wrong things" narrows options perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (salt air, dust footprints, orchid wind) filtered poetically; labyrinth walls constrain paths and charge final pulsing image. Canyon/loom as micro-setting guides choices to climax without postcard genericism. Recurrent threads evolve causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via footprints/needle/voice to weaving deepening that forecloses breaking vs. integrating. Agency in picking needle/sewing shows trade-off with felt warmth/cost. One pressure point sufficient; final reconfiguration charges image undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining precedents emerges organically from plate/needle/tapestry without statement; final gust reweights ruin-to-reverence non-literally. Subtext in unseen walker/voice implies haunting optimism's cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with poetic perceptual signature (grooves as "ribs," shadows "thickening like syrup"); diction/rhythm modulate from steady breath to shallow under stress. No head-hopping or withholding; voice confident yet biased toward wonder. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud from long atmospheric to short climax pulses. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("syrup," "forge") during needle pickup slightly muddles peak without obscuring cause/effect. No loops, clean syntax; propulsion strong to final exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic labyrinth with memory-weaving transforms ruin trope via plate/loom; poetic weaver's angle non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Final orchid wind inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
