<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong character-specific motivation in Lira's moonbeam theft for luminous moments, with contradictory impulses (steal vs. build) acting in the jar-sharing beat; Kael's reinterpretation trait forces her relational shift. Final endurance (staying) feels mostly earned via prior glow pulses, but "understood then—destiny wasn’t something you eavesdropped on" edges toward unearned epiphany, softening pivotal closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: light/flower density builds to Charged Poise closure ("Then we make our own track") with legible opportunity cost as train pulls away without them, jar reconfiguring options. Single scene oriented early ("emerald station," Lira's jar by para 2); no causality breaks, one tightening via Kael encounter narrows to shared path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (glowing windows like fireflies, emerald tiles shimmering) mirror internal luminosity and constrain choice (platform proximity to train/bench). Recurring jar-as-micro-setting charges final image ("moonbeams...forming shapes—doors, keys"), but minor sunlight-to-twilight evolution lacks one tactile evolution cue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (press ear to destiny via jar/train) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through Kael's rose code narrowing to relational choice; agency in refusal to board forecloses path with visible cost (whistle blows, train leaves). Escalation coheres via motif density reweighting isolation to merger, no coincidences resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of curating illuminated moments emerges organically from jar/rose/light particulars, reweighted in final image ("standing in the light...jar pulsed...promising") without moralizing. Subtext in flower codes and reinterpretation vs. theft invites ambiguity on destiny-building; protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical texture ("windows glowing like fireflies trapped in glass"); perceptual bias toward light selective and character-bound. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("White for new beginnings...petals form a door"), advances plot with goal pursuit; rhythm modulates seamlessly to charged closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("jar...pulsed faintly, as if sensing"), but figurative overwriting in high-pressure beats ("moonbeams inside stretched...liquid starlight") mixes vehicles without pattern payoff, dulling closure image slightly; minor paraphrase loop in light descriptors ("glowing," "luminous," "illuminate").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of moonbeam theft, flower codes, and light curation transforms tropes into organic premise; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via irreplaceable jar/rose door. Bold final reconfiguration ("shadows merging into one") feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
