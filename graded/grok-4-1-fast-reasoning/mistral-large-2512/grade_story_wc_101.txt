<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's gentle persistence is embodied in micro-choices like ringing the bell softly and lingering with elders, rooting motivation in community endurance. Interiority concrete via tactile details (tracing tiles, bell's weight), with endurance earned as sanctions tighten. Limited contradictory impulses reduce depth, but final ritual reveals values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of donations/runs/bells builds density to Charged Poise closure in final image of children holding bells, reconfiguring giver-receiver bond with felt endurance cost amid worsening sanctions. Mosaic shards (finding bell → runs → second bell) taught early via ritual repetition, transitions legible by time markers. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor as micro-setting constrains rituals (central table glows like captured star) and charges closure image. Sensory details selective/POV-biased (lavender scent, muted chime, trembling hands), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear across caves/ridge; evolves with dusk lamps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endurance vs. sanctions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as patrols double but donations precise/second bell deepens bond. Agency in persistent runs/ritual forecloses defiance path with visible cost (dangerous roads, no proof). One decisive intensification suffices; cost legible in "sanctions worsened."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nameless giving/memory emerges organically from bells/stories, answered non-literally in final echo: reweights premise that "some things don’t need names." Subtext in silences/gestures (no note, shaky handwriting); ambiguity lingers without confusion, charged by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (tactile/auditory focus on chimes, wind). Prose texture rhythmic/poetic ("dusk bled into twilight," "glow like a captured star"), modulating with quiet intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("For the children"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "bell resting... scent of lavender" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm/syntax propels without loops or scaffolds; no figurative muddle or filter stacks in peak beats. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile resilience via quiet bells/rituals transforms tropes (sanctions, donations) into textured endurance. Risky amplified quiet heightens stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
