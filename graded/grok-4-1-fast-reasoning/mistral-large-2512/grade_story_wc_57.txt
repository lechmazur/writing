<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve ancient methods is clear and embodied in patient knot-tracing, but lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle acting simultaneously; pure competence without flaws complicating choices flattens character depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with steady density build from rope patterns to Weeping Shoals name and final water flicker as Charged Poise closure; cost legible in patient isolation amid worsening snow/fog, reweighting myths as real without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dock, snow, and thickening fog constrain patient decoding choices and charge final sighting image; sensory hierarchy (creaking planks, lapping water, frigid breath) reflects Elias's priorities, vivid and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding/preservation signaled early with textural tightening via name revelation and flicker sighting narrowing mythic options; pressure coheres but low opposition limits agency-driven escalation, cost felt obliquely in endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving encoded wisdom emerges organically from knot-seed parallels and final smile reconfiguring patience as pursuit; resonant without moralizing, though ambiguity lingers effectively in water shapes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (knots as "seeds" of ideas); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel steadily without loops or scaffolds; figurative language (fog "like a living thing") consistent and atmospheric, no overwriting in peak decode beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knot ciphers as ancient "seeds" and philosophical collector transforms trope of hidden knowledge organically; risk in solo atmospheric drive heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
