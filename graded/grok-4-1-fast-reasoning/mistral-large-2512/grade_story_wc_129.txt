<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to graft onto community roots in consistent sculptor traits, with embodied emotions (breath curling, chest tight) and micro-choices (hesitating then proposing joint search) under pressure. Internal conflict of edge-watching versus joining acts simultaneously in her approach and dedication. Travelers apply secondary pressure without stealing focus; earned change via sculpture loss feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern (webs, glimmers, lines) build to Resonant Reconfiguration closure when sculpture absorbs and hand-mark appears, reweighting belonging with legible cost (sculpture gone, echoed life surrendered). Orientation anchors early (Liora in orchard seeking arbor). One tightening via shared tag search narrows isolation to integration; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (glass branches swaying, arbor pulsing, silver lake) filter through sculptor's bias toward edges and glimmers, constraining choices (arbor heart pulls her). Orchard/crater subtly pressures search choreography. Arbor charges final image, mirroring internal shift from untethered to rooted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kinship belonging) signals early, tightens via joint search finding tag then Liora's dedication, forcing trade-off (surrender sculpture). Accumulative escalation deepens density to blazing silhouettes, with agency in proposal/placement and on-page cost (sculpture absorbed). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Webs of kinship theme emerges organically from particulars (reed figures, arbor webs, tag stitch), culminating in resonant final image (hand-mark grafts her, finding root not graft) that reweights isolation without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures invites ambiguity on chosen kin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with sculptor's perceptual signature (jagged edges, polished stones). Prose texture modulates rhythm with intensity (short sentences at discovery). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("let’s look together" pursues goal), distinct from narration; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels via image integration (e.g., "single, unbroken line... pulsed like a heartbeat"). Minor figurative density in opening settles into purposeful pattern without muddle or loops. Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reed sculpture, obsidian arbor, and Veyra's tag transforms kinship trope into tangible webs charged by Liora's outsider graft. Risky crystalline/volcanic imagery feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
