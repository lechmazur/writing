<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied ache ("dull ache in his ribs") and scar-tracing, rooting motivation to read personal wounds; change feels earned via tunnel choice ignoring moss warning, foreclosing retreat. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory patterns (sand, scars, rings) densify to chamber CR closure ("Elias understood then"), with cost in shattered hourglasses and ache's end legible on page. Orientation anchors early (tower dawn by para 1); single tightening via tunnel suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects (hourglass, cup) constrain choices and charge final image, e.g., frosted sand spilling cascades to tunnel prompt; sensory hierarchy (plant "voices," moss hum) filters via Elias's bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (scar, ribs) tethers body to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closure via miracle/scars) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through plant warnings narrowing options to tunnel entry; agency in touching cup forces shattering reversal with legible cost (tower groan, ache release). One deepening suffices, reweighting via CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of displaced miracles/scars-as-stories emerges organically from particulars (vine curl memory, coffee rings), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant CR answers "stories in scars" non-literally, lingering via ache's end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature (plant "whispers," scar reading) biased to Elias; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates dawn hush to chamber intensity without drift. No dialogue; purposeful compression teaches pattern early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short gasps amid longer cascades), density high with multi-job lines (e.g., "sand spill in a slow, glittering cascade"); minor figurative density in opening beats but purposeful, no loops/muddle touching closure. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, frosted hourglasses, coffee-ring scars transforms tropes (e.g., magic object) into inevitable CR; risk in quiet dawn-to-chamber arc heightens stakes via hushed inevitability, organic to voice.</comment>
