<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove emotion absorption is embodied in micro-choices like tracing frost and pressing the quartz, with contradictory belief/doubt impulses acting in the communion beat. Final realization earned by causal buildup from frost vision to memory unfolding. Interiority particular via prism memory and attuned listening; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns seed memory communion, density tightens to CR closure where arbor's transformation reweights premise with conceptual cost of fractured truth. Orientation anchored early (Elias in arbor by para 1). One deepening (man’s memory surfaces) narrows to mirror insight; final image of melted frost pays off with undeniable shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost constrain communion (patterns reveal face, hum guides listening) and charge final image (melted frost shifted into fabric). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: mystic notices vibrations, dendritic veins. Atmosphere tensions silence with pulsing rhythm; no white-room, all integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove absorption) signaled early, textural escalation via layering (frost → prism → memory → realization) deepens knowledge, foreclosing pure-proof path. Agency in raising prism/pressing palm tests commitment; conceptual cost legible in "truth was never pure... always bent." Minor abstractness pre-communion limits to 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bent truth emerges organically from prism light/arbor memory/frost echo, reweighting absorption premise without statement. Final CR ("mirrors, reflecting... altering") resonates as non-literal answer with ambiguity (truthful lies). Subtext in shifted hush lingers via particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature: mystic bias toward unseen vibrations/patterns. Lyrical rhythm modulates (short breaths in communion, expansive realization); diction controlled, purposeful elision of backstory via concrete cues. Prose as character: syntax bends like light in insight beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short exhalations propel); no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (light/prism motif purposeful). Minor figurative density in arbor description ("spectral shards") risks overwrites but integrates without muddling peaks. Propulsion clear, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost patterns as emotion language transforms mystic trope via specific tools (prism/arbor). Risky lyric communion beat inevitable from setup; no templates, voice commits to fractured-truth premise without retreat.</comment>
