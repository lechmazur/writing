<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies through inherited gambling lens and micro-choice to light the lantern, earning closure commitment with embodied cost ("weight...pressing against her ribs"). Internal conflict embodied in contradictory impulses toward debts vs. revelation. Minor reflection summary on father's traits slightly abstracts without full scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via scrawls to basement revelation; closure as CR ("The house doesn’t always win") reconfigures premise with conceptual cost on final page. Orientation anchored early (library entry). Single scene with backstory shards fits scope; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mica-pane lantern recurs as micro-setting constraining revelation choice and charging final image ("light turned white-hot"). Sensory details (wet parchment, mildew) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal melancholy. Weather (rain) subtly pressures mood without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve debts/legacy) signaled early, tightens via Accumulative cadence to lantern revelation narrowing options to "burn the numbers." Agency in match strike forecloses old path with felt cost. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bending rules via "lucid contradictions" emerges organically from scrawls/equations, resonant CR in final truth reweighting father's arc without statement. Subtext in images (fractured rainbows) invites ambiguity on rebellion's price. No moralizing; complexity in cost acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (probability metaphors like "universe’s cruelest jokes"); diction/rhythm modulate to charged poise at revelation. Librarian dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your father used to ask..."). No head-hopping; voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short revelation sentences accelerate). Minor figurative density ("ink bleeding like veins") in opening but purposeful for tone; no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Clean mechanics support ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gambling professor legacy with "lucid contradictions" equations transforming tropes via mica revelation. Risk in lyric Accumulative build pays off in CR without gimmick. Specific scrawl pursuit feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
