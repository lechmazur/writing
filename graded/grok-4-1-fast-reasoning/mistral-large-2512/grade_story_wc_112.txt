<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives consistent micro-choices like overriding AI protocols and syncing the hologram, culminating in an earned laugh of wonder/despair; interiority feels embodied in "heart pounded" and "hands trembling." Minor slip in unearned expertise on xenos without prior struggle, but flaws like delusion of grandeur complicate her competence without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links: hologram sync reveals lever, pulling it triggers visions and nexus collapse (DC/CR) with legible cost in alarms and failed stabilization; single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2. Orientation clear, one tightening via lever pull narrows options to irreversible proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and "mechanically warm" air constrain choices tactilely, mirroring internal hush; station evolves with shudder and alarms, filtering through Elara's mechanic priorities (thermal regulators, gases). Recurring nexus distortion charges final collapse image; no white-room, sensory hierarchy sharpens under nexus urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early tightens via lever pull reversal, forcing trade-off of stability for proof with on-page cost (collapsing nexus, alarms); agency in overriding AI and reaching through hologram drives causal escalation. Coherent pressure crystallizes stance in final laugh, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as lateral emerges organically from xenos' hum, visions, and "pendulums of a clock," reweighted in CR without moralizing; final image of wings and laugh offers resonant ambiguity on human limits. Subtext in dismissed mechanic's truth avoids binaries, arising from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (mechanic's interfaces, frequencies) biases details; rhythmic modulation builds to "subdued awakening" under stress, no head-hopping. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "slipping between moments like pages in a book," apt for speculative tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "holographic interface... danced across the nexus"); minor paraphrase loops in "hush" repetitions and light figurative density in opening ("slow, sleeping breaths") dull propulsion slightly without touching closure. Rhythm varies, no major artifacts or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology, sideways time, and mechanic's lever transforms tropes via nexus/xenos logic; risk in non-physical lever and visions pays off in CR without gimmick. Ingenuity in "time moves sideways" premise feels inevitable from hum patterns, no derivative echoes.</comment>
