<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gentle radical traits drive internal conflict, with embodied defiance peaking in unflinching palm-press to the accusing stone. Contradictory impulses—vengeance vs. mercy—act simultaneously as she traces Amira's name yet chooses to rebuild it. Final micro-choice of pressing lapis earns renunciation of erasure with visible skin-dig cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via stone discovery → Amira reveal → tessera placement, tightening to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "chipped patterns dug into her skin, but she didn’t flinch." Orientation anchors early; single scene holds lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tesserae recur to constrain choices and charge final image, from "scattered like fallen stars" to blood-drawing lapis press. Sensory hierarchy (charred cedar, lantern glow, sharp edges) filters via retro-trapped POV, mirroring internal fracture. Shattered sky evolves to pressure present endurance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy vs. vengeance) deepens accumulatively: stone splinter → name accusation → reweighted placement foreclosing erasure. Agency in "pressed it into... where Amira had once been" pays cost unmistakably on page, crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy emerges organically from mosaic erasure motif, reweighted in final tessera act as non-literal answer to past inaction. Resonance lingers via "not alone," tying renaming to endured weight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (past-present bleed: "saw the plaza as it had been—alive... while the present crumbled") modulates rhythmically under reflective pressure. Stable single POV; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via image-charged sentences; mosaic/shatter metaphors cohere without muddle, accelerating to "picked up another tessera." Zero loops; varied rhythm varies with introspection to action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Retrocognition fused with aberrant mercy via negative-space name transforms post-fire rebuild trope into fresh conceptual risk. Mosaic mechanics heighten stakes organically, culminating in inevitable "name would stay. But now, it would mean something else."</comment>
