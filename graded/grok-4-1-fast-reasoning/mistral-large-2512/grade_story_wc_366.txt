<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's reticence shown through actions like tracing soot and silent replies; motivation from daughter's loss anchors micro-choices, earning shift from isolation via accumulated notes. Internal endurance of ache feels embodied without therapy-speak. Final understanding forecloses loneliness with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note/stone density builds to CR closure in "He understood then," reweighting haunting premise with emotional cost of prior solitude legible in final image. One tightening via Elias's stone reply narrows isolation. Orientation anchored by dock arrival; shards cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lantern room constrains stone placement and lamp lighting; sea glass/stones as micro-settings charge final spiral image. Sensory bias (soot under thumb, gust rattling panes) reflects Elias's tactile priorities. Atmosphere mirrors ache without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anonymous connection signaled early, deepens accumulatively through replies and lamp ignition forcing stance crystallization. Agency in stone-building/lighting forecloses disconnection with emotional cost felt in exhaled chest tightness. Coherent pressure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of passed safety/light emerges from note/stone chain without statement; final image reconfigures loneliness via living protectors, resonating prior ache non-literally. Complexity in ache's ambiguity lingers earnedly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (rope rhythms, salt-smoothed glass); rhythmic prose modulates ache to resolution. Compression in shards purposeful and legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with light motifs purposeful, not muddled; rhythm varies (short gust sentences heighten peak). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion weaves image/action seamlessly to charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: haunted lighthouse by living via stone messages transforms trope organically; stone reply turn inevitable from note chain, risking quiet CR payoff that heightens stakes.</comment>
