<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve silence roots consistently in his 17-year vow, compelling the pivotal hesitation before opening the box. Interiority shines in embodied details like "breath catching in his throat" during the climax. Minor slip: passive observation dominates until the final choice, slightly undercutting contradictory impulses in earlier beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ghost density and box fixation build to Conceptual Repricing closure when ghosts dissolve after "The bees remember what the living forget." Orientation anchors firmly by paragraph 2 (oasis, silence vow). Cost legible in "silence was different now—lighter," reconfiguring his covenant with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via ghosts gathering "near the box," charging the final lingering touch on glass. Sensory details like "honeycomb husks" and "ghostly echo of wings" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal solitude. Wasteland oasis evolves subtly with sun "bleeding into the horizon," heightening climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence covenant vs. ghostly insistence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as ghosts "press against the glass" and the solid ghost points deliberately. Protagonist agency peaks in opening the box, foreclosing isolation with felt lighter silence cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserved unspoken words emerges organically from box note and ghost release, reweighting silence without statement. Final image of scattering petals offers resonant non-literal answer to covenant-breaking. Subtext in unfinished gestures and "lips moved without sound" invites ambiguity on witnessing's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: Elias notices "unfinished gestures" and "twitched fingers." Voice modulates poetically for mute eloquence, diction like "flickering like candle flames" fits recluse's tranquil lens. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short climax sentences ("Elias hesitated.") amid longer atmospheric builds; high density in peak (box opening). Minor overwrite in repeated "unspoken words" phrasing (-0.3), but no loops dull closure. Zero scaffold; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible ghosts, beekeeping wasteland, and bee-motif box transforms silence trope into inevitable release. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; premise commits to ghost-witnessing rule fully.</comment>
