<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Meticulous traits root motivation in prior work history, compelling shift from observation to action; interiority embodied in neck prickle and pulse steadiness under unease. Contradictory impulses (solitude refuge vs. integrity demand) act in courtyard listening beat. Final choice earned by curiosity buildup, foreclosing inaction with felt cost to isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory layering (wind sounds to mechanical rhythm); holds to Charged Poise closure where turning east crystallizes stakes with integrity cost ("solitude... required action"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (courtyard, recorder, message). One tightening via rhythm pattern break narrows to deliberate pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard fountain rainwater reflects stars, constraining listening choice and charging final threshold image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (wind as professional cue amid moss/thunder). Details evolve causally (dusk bleeding to shadow) without stasis, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel quarantine mystery) signaled via message; Accumulative escalation via sound density to rhythm forces lateral stance crystallization. Agency in sitting/listening forecloses direct confrontation with unease cost. Visible price: recorder shifts from tool to promise, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of observation-to-action emerges from particulars (message thread, city listening); final image reconfigures solitude-integrity tension without statement. Resonance from wind charting vs. unchartable wound, lingering ambiguity on hidden rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (storm metaphors: "skirting a mountain," "sky before clouds"). Rhythm modulates from reflective to propulsive in listening beat. No head-hopping; compression taught via intuition elision, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "weight of unseen eyes" advances unease/atmosphere); varied rhythm/read-aloud flow. Minor overwriting in reflective opener contained pre-pressure, no closure touch; no loops or artifacts dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm recorder as integrity promise transforms mystery trope via lateral listening in textured city-wound world. Risk in quiet poise ending heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
