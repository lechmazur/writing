<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Courier's embodied tremors and pulse shifts under pressure reveal contradictory routine-duty vs. emerging wonder impulses; micro-choices like nodding and gasping earn her final steady steps with mentor-loss cost. Stranger applies targeted pressure via recognition of pendant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (vibrations, auroras) builds to Charged Poise closure where inward turn reconfigures routine life, pendant's spent stillness legible as cost in final image. Orientation anchored early; stranger encounter tightens without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain path/choices, evolving dynamically (stones shift, sky breathes) to charge final humming air and pulsing heartbeat image. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wind voices) reflects courier's dawning priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relic delivery amid pendant's pull) signaled early; accumulative escalation via intensifying vibrations/stranger forces agency in engagement, narrowing to inward threshold with felt cost of spent magic and absence. One decisive density shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wonder-from-routine theme emerges organically via pendant/aurora images shifting from routine delivery to marrow-deep echo; final steady steps offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior blur of memory/myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (aurora hues, wind voices) stable in single close-third POV; stranger dialogue carries subtext/goal pursuit naturally, modulating rhythm under intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Varied syntax/rhythm propels with high density, metaphors (prism wings, sky breath) purposeful without muddle; no loops or scaffolds, though minor figurative density in peak risks slight opacity but integrates to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pendant-as-germinator transforms relic-trope into inward myth-blur threshold; fresh synthesis of courier mythos feels inevitable, risking bold lyric accumulative risks that heighten resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
