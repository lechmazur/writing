<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in shaking hands vs. pressing ahead with tattoo; motivation from accident guilt compels pivotal tattoo choice with embodied cost (burning marks). Flaws like cowardice drive mistakes, resolved via earned stasis. 9+ test met: impulses act in tattoo scene, final renunciation earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds/cries builds to tattoo cadence shift. On-page RR closure ("laboratory fell silent") with felt cost (stitched guilt). Orientation anchored in first para; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab details (rusted phonographs, humming jars) selectively pressure via cries; amber as micro-setting constrains ink/tattoo choice and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (sounds dominant) fits POV urgency. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt/dissonance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via translator accusation to firmware faces, tightening to tattoo agency. Cost legible in "first mark burned," foreclosing running. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tethering/listening emerges organically from amber/letters/tattoos; final image ("mosquito’s wings caught the light... silence") offers resonant CR repricing without moral. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (sound-constellation bias) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from vibrating cries to hush. Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative purposeful ("meteor hush") without muddle, propels to silence image. Minor repetition of "silence" pays off accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tattooist silencing cries via amber-ink transforms guilt trope; risk in haunted firmware translating accident pays off uniquely at closure. Non-obvious premise feels inevitable. 9+ test met.</comment>
