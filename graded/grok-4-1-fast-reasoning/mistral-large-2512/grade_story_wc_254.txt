<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in aesthetic drive compels micro-choices like tracing quartz and voicing poetry; embodied "drumbeat in her ribs" anchors interiority without clichés. Internal conflict subtle but present in defiance of elders versus certainty's pull. Final reconfiguration earned via immersion, foreclosing separation with felt heaviness in limbs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure: boundary dissolves, ice melts, with legible cost in "limbs heavy with the weight." Single scene anchors orientation early ("cobalt atrium by the frozen lake"); no shards or ambiguity. Persistent quartz constraint shapes progression without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (quartz "pulsed in time with her breath," ice crack echoes) constrains choices and mirrors immersion; lake's thaw charges final image per 9+ test. POV-biased filter (poetic noticing of "light pooled like liquid cobalt") avoids catalog. Coherent choreography in kneeling and standing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve boundaries) signaled early, escalates via ice crack and hum intensification under Accum lens, narrowing to writing as agency-driven deepening. Cost unmistakable in dissolution's weight foreclosing prior separation. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of poet-poem unity emerges organically from immersion motifs, culminating in resonant CR: "both and neither," reweighting palimpsest premise without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer via hush settling "into her bones." No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close stable with perceptual signature (poetic syntax like "world as a poem half-finished"); rhythm modulates from hum's pulse to softening cadence. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled within poet's lexicon. Elevated register purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crack split the ice... hummed louder" advances sound, stakes, action); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor template cadence in "the way" repeats (−0.4) and "boundary" paraphrases dull propulsion slightly, but no closure harm. Varied syntax supports immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric fantasy where atrium's hum enables poet's merger, transforming trope via textural accumulation; risk in dissolving POV boundary heightens stakes. No templates; premise (post-ban garden) inevitable in hindsight with hush's hush payoff.</comment>
