<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find story beginnings intensifies through embodied uncertainty (tracing bottle's pulse) and micro-choices (admitting ignorance), earning the closure realization; woman's pressure reveals his limits without safety-hedging. Minor abstract interiority ("question without an answer") doesn't touch pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds to woman's exchange as tightening, yielding CR closure ("absence felt heavier") with legible conceptual cost in fading name and empty bottle space; orientation anchored early in library/vendor setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard's crystalline branches and cloud sea constrain choices (endless undecided shelves guide key query) and charge final door image; selective sensory hierarchy (ozone/paper, prismatic dust) mirrors Elias's scattered mindfulness without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) signaled early tightens accumulatively via exchange narrowing options to acceptance; agency in endurance forecloses knowing-path with felt cost (warm coin fading), though external pressure leans situational without full hybrid depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings-in-absence emerges organically from particulars (dissolving key/seeds, traded bottle); final image ("story starting again") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting motifs like fading incision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (noticing hums, pulses, fogged breath) and rhythmic diction modulate pressure; dialogue carries subtext/goals ("What is it?" pools into key), distinguishing voices via fragmentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels (short punchy exchanges amid lyric swells); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors consistent (moonlight-to-key) without muddle in peak dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-undecided-realm transforms tropes (floating shelves, bottled stories) into inevitable CR; bold fragmentation risks heighten stakes in woman's smoke-exit without gimmickry.</comment>
