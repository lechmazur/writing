<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation from trembling hands to steady voice, rooted in funerary traits; inadvertent stubbornness constrains return with felt heaviness in legs during walk. Minor slip: internal conflict more declarative than simultaneous impulses in pivotal desk moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via humming density to choral swell; orientation anchored early at workbench. Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly with cost in hands steadying and light's return, reconfiguring city's promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like jagged edges refracting rainbows and pulsing spines constrain wading/entry choices. Final glow seeps into bones, charging image; underwater library evolves from silhouette to lit dome without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of answering distress tightens accumulatively via memory shards and lens chorus, narrowing to reading choice. Agency in placing lens forecloses abandonment; cost legible in stilling water and personal stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of purposeful rest emerges organically from lens hum to golden glow, reweighting drowned promise without statement. Final image offers non-literal resonance, tying stubborn return to earned stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward pulses/hums; rhythmic prose modulates from fractured rainbows to seeping glow. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits weary idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; purposeful metaphors like "teeth" and "embers" propel without muddle. Minor density strain in "older than" chain, but supports textural lens without obscuring closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker as space-fitter revitalizing drowned library light; transforms tropes via stubborn distress pull. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in charged final stillness without gimmickry.</comment>
