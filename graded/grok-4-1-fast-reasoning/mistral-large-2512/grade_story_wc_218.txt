<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in defiance and preservation drives micro-choices like wiring; embodied emotion in tracing pillars and tossing berries. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, muting peak complexity. Endurance earned via futile remodel with death's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wiring to dusk arch; Charged Poise closure in animal trust and "He would not live to see" reconfigures options with mortality cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: pillars "humming faintly," moss-slick altar filter through caretaker bias. Living stone constrains remodel choices; charges final twilight image with leaning pillars like "old friends."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard vs developers/death) signaled early, tightens via "developers would arrive in a week" forcing final arch. Agency in persistent wiring despite futility; cost felt in time pressure and bodily sweat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of organic/mineral harmony emerges via particulars like symbiotic roots; final animals eating from palm offers resonant non-literal answer on remembrance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: "pulse of the earth beneath," selective to flora/stone. Rhythmic control modulates meditative wiring to charged dusk; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like wire oxidizing "turning green, blending"; purposeful "remember" repetition charges closure without loop. Varied rhythm avoids monotony, minor overwriting in pillar descriptors contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living architecture remodel via copper wire against developers; non-obvious interspecies respect angle transforms eco-trope through specific defiance.</comment>
