<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid embodiment in Maris's gestures (mirror tilt to tooth gap, pebble hand-close) reveals hierarchy of silent teaching under girl's accusatory pressure; minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously keeps it from 9+. Girl's shift earned via micro-choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density from shutters builds to girl's interaction then CR closure in final mirror-to-stars image with endurance cost legible ("world was full of things that needed teaching"); orientation anchored early (dock, dusk by para 2); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dock's rain-slick planks and shutters constrain isolation/choices (girl approaches despite "contagion" fear) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (visual fractures, tactile damp, auditory lapping) POV-biased toward weaving; cobalt fades causally to black, mirroring stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent teaching vs. witch fear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fading light/shadow patterns forcing gesture-escalation (mirror, pebble); girl's "not a witch" crystallizes stance with felt relational cost, though no overt trade-off narrows further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence-weaving understanding emerges organically from mica pebble glow and final stars repricing "darkness the value of stars"; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing; ambiguity in Maris's endurance lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (light as woven ribbons, silence as craft) with rhythmic modulation; girl's dialogue natural/childlike/subtextual ("showing me the dark"); no head-hopping, diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively without loops; figurative coherence (light "ribbons," air "stitched") supports texture, no muddle in peak (pebble exchange); minor stock ("bruised sky") but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms witch trope via dental mirror/pebble mechanics into silent empathy; risk in quiet stasis heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable dock-weaving frame feels organic.</comment>
