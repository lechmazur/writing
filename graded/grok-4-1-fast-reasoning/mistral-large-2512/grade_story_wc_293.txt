<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt possibility vividly embodied in childhood boats and playing for road-ghosts, with glass flake as concrete anchor tilting present choice; contradictory belief ("didn’t believe in signs, but believed in weights") acts in scene via slowed song. Minor limit: reflective endurance over high-stakes micro-choices caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure (valley sharpens then mists, road "luminous with disbelief"); cost legible in "not-knowing was where the music lived." Orientation anchored early at pullout; single-shard fits defaults, no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pullout guardrail, pixelated valley, wet stone scent constrain perception and force rain-driven departure; recurring valley evolves (blurs, sharpens, mists) to charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (fiddle hum, boot seam) reflects fiddler's bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue traces/possibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via flake-handling, slowed song, valley-shift forcing road-commitment; agency in playing/tucking/deciding forecloses hesitation with not-knowing cost. Enters 8+ via trade-off legibility, but quiet pressure limits peak reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibility-from-traces emerges organically via flake, song, valley reprise reweighting "never"; final image offers non-literal answer (world beautiful despite edges) without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (fractured light, ether scent) modulates rhythmically from hum to roar; single-POV stable, diction biased to sensory weights. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at charged end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "fiddle’s bow caught... hung like a question"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor figurative density in reflective stretches (e.g., pixelated file) borders overwrite but serves accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler-observant + collodion relic + pixelated world transforms road-ghost trope; scaffold flutters and "luminous disbelief" inflections grow from particulars, risk-taking heightens quiet stakes inevitably.</comment>
