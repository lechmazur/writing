<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between protecting valley and honoring past acts in scene via embodied tremble before opening envelope; final resolve earned by discovery with visible cost in stilled hands. Contradictory impulses shown simultaneously; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory details and discoveries density-build to CR closure in realization and coiled chain; cost legible in "betrayal" reconciled via note's voice. Orientation anchored immediately in amphitheater-volcano; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing stone constrains discovery path (chain unspools to envelope) and charges final exhale-approval image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gears whisper to calloused fingers); details evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize values) signaled early, tightens via adhesive analysis and note to reweight floodgates as continuation; agency in knife-pry and resolve forecloses control path with felt betrayal cost. Escalation via textural density under lens; cost unmistakable in laugh-resolve shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance (water's voice vs. fire wrath) emerges organically from particulars like notches and note; final "dancing" image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral. Epiphany earned through struggle; ambiguity lingers in wild/ancient taming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (land's language, stone sighs); rhythmic modulation heightens realization (whisper to laugh). No head-hopping; diction biased to Mira's machinist intimacy with stone/water.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line integrates action/atmosphere (chain "unspool down the steps like a silver river"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak note-reading beat. Figuratives purposeful and coherent, supporting textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcano amphitheater, surveyor code, floodgate ethics transforms dormant trope into balance cycle; risk in lyric breathing motif heightens stakes organically. Final chain-pulse reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
