<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority in Elias's hands tracing gears and screw, revealing contradictory absence-as-presence; Clara's steady hands force his micro-choice to etch, earning closure change with felt cost. Minor slip: Clara's traits shown but less contradictory than Elias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from entry to name reveal to etching; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with Elias "holding it" amid chime, cost legible in emotional reconfiguration of absence. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fogged windows and dripping water clock constrain touch-focused perception and charge final chime image, mirroring internal thaw; sensory hierarchy (touch/sound over sight/smell) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humanize screw) signaled early, deepens via name reveal tightening emotional options; agency in etching forecloses mere repair path with relational cost felt in brush of fingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from screw's worn threads to etched constellation, reweighting premise in final "holding it" without statement; resonant non-literal answer to occluded meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual signature in tactile bias ("fingers tracing grooves"); dialogue subtextual ("not here to fix") advances goal; rhythmic modulation peaks at etching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., screw pickup reveals character/sets stakes); varied rhythm propels to chime; minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught as voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-loss to tactile mapping/etching births non-obvious twist in shared name, transforming repair trope; risk in quiet emotional poise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
