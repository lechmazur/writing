<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in trembling fingers during vision and final exhale of wavering certainty compel renunciation; woman's voice earns shift with inheritance cost. Minor label-speak like "helix-minded" genericizes without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to mirror vision and whisper, yielding Charged Poise closure in tucking satchel ("To erase them would be to erase the woman entirely"); cost legible as inherited despair. Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchored in canyon/mirror by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlight pools and fractures constrain angle/pressing action, mirroring internal states; canyon hum charges final silver path as transformed reverie. Selective sensory hierarchy (humming pressure, cold glass) via helix bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to modify tightens accumulatively via pulsing face/voice reversal, narrowing to renunciation agency; cost unmistakable in risked inheritance blurring Lena's certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fractures-as-story motif shifts from fixable conduit to essential memory, reweighting preservation premise in final image without literal moral. Emerges organically from relic pursuit and vision particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (fractures as constellations, light remembering); rhythmic syntax modulates from precise to quaking under pressure. Stable single-POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (fractures pulsing like jagged constellations) propel to closure; minor helix-minded repetition creates template echo without obscuring. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no stacks or loops dull peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Entangled memories in relics synthesize fresh premise of dream-archeology; lyric risk-taking in accumulative visions inevitable to reconfiguration, transforming abandonment trope via specific fractures.</comment>
