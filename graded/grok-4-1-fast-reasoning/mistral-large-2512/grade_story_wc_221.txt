<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied emotion shine in compass heat and trembling pencil; motivation to map time drives micro-choices under isolation pressure. Final realization earned via prior causality without epiphanic shortcuts. Minor reflective summaries stay anchored per BRR, not flattening closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from deck hush to anomaly pulse, culminating in CR closure where station reconfigures as threshold with isolation cost legible in "he was the only one." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via glimpse suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Time-dilated stars as "lazy ribbons" constrain perception and charge final image; sensory selectivity (fogged glass, humming machinery) mirrors internal shift. Deck as micro-setting guides choice to cross threshold without spatial vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to exploration) tightens accumulatively via glimpse-anomaly, narrowing to stance crystallization in drawing act. Cost felt in pariah endurance; agency in pressing glass and sketching forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of true north as choice emerges organically from compass promise, sketches, and anomaly; final image non-literally reweights prison-to-threshold without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (time as "tapestry"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in "silence deepened... full of possibility." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (e.g., "frozen breath," "ribbons") enhancing closure image. Zero artifacts dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-sight gift/curse and anomaly threshold transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious CR feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
