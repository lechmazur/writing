<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation rooted in father's legacy drives concrete micro-choices like flashing the watch fob, earning the intervention with embodied cost (shaking hands). Interiority particular (watch as "key to something"); men apply targeted pressure. Minor slip: men's stock snarls lack distinction, but doesn't touch her closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oriented early (pier/market/Lena by para 2). Situational lens holds: pressure coheres from false starts to knife standoff, resolving in Charged Poise closure ("delayed it") with legible cost in final exhale and slipping back. One tightening via intervention narrows violence option on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (salt/rust/rum) filters through Lena's smuggler bias; pier/market constrains stealth moves, lanterns guide intervention. Watch fob as recurring micro-setting charges final image ("warm against her palm"), mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust break) signals early, tightens via agency-driven intervention that forecloses violence with visible cost (hands shaking). Situational pressure crystallizes stance; one reversal suffices, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges organically via hush/knife/watch progression; final image reconfigures hope ("stubborn hope that it might...hold") without moralizing, resonating through particulars. Subtext in dialogue hesitation carries ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (danger's "sharp tang"); poetic rhythm modulates tension. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Elias’s girl" recognition advances plot); no head-hopping, diction fits gritty locale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; minor metaphor density ("wavering fingers," "sharpest blade") in opener but integrates without muddle. No loops/artifacts dull closure; rhythm breathes with hush build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pirate market under pier transforms smuggling tropes via hush mechanics; watch fob's legacy inflects fresh on trust calculus. Risky poetic voice heightens unease without gimmick; turns feel inevitable from setup.</comment>
