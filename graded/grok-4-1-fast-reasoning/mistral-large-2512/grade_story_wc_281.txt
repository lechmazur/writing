<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic trait drives Mara’s arc from doubt (“Prove it”) to belief, with embodied conflict in painting skin despite skepticism; final hand-holding and believed “Prove it” earns change with relational cost. Eli applies subtle pressure without stealing focus. Minor slip: epiphany accelerates slightly without deeper irrationality in peak memory gasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from skin-painting to air-threads and foreign memory, culminating in CR closure (“pathways remained, glowing faintly”) with conceptual cost of accepting rewiring over reversal. Orientation anchored early in studio/shock. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in “live with it.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (ozone/burnt sugar, pulsing paint) vivid and purposeful, with body/geode/paint as micro-settings constraining choices (shock-path tracing) and charging final glowing pathways. POV bias filters urgency (fractal precision noticed). No white-room; evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map/reverse pill effects) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory surfacing that forces acceptance; agency in painting/swallowing pill forecloses reversal path. Cost felt in shifted belief. One deepening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes before memory beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden pathways/illumination emerges organically from geode/paint/memory, reweighting skepticism in final image (“Prove it” believed) without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Subtext in Eli’s silent support adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractal/light motifs); rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short sentences in gasp). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (“turning yourself into a question”). No head-hopping; diction fits skeptic’s precise idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., static dissolving/reforming); metaphors coherent (threads/veins). No loops/artifacts; “devising” reprise purposeful. Propulsion clear to glowing closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy/somatic art/geode refracts tropes into inevitable CR; risk in painting air pays off without gimmickry. Non-obvious willowglass neologism heightens tone (+0.3).</comment>
