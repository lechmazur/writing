<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority ties lost-wax casting to memory preservation, with embodied emotion peaking in "weight in his chest ease" after unspooling; contradictory guilt vs. action earns final forgiveness without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to Charged Poise closure; "rope vibrated... humming with the names" reconfigures stance with legible emotional cost of past silence, orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora and frost constrain choices—breath warms stiff rope—and charge final "aurora shimmered... sky, too, had found peace"; selective sensory hierarchy reflects caster's tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving names tightens via weaving then unspooling under Accumulative lens, with agency in "let it unspool like a river of sound" forcing emotional trade-off; cost felt in foreclosed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. forgetting emerges organically from rope's hum as non-literal answer to "world forgot too easily"; final "rope’s song still humming in his bones" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward shaping metaphors ("shaping hollows, pouring molten metal"); rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical peak in unspooling without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (aurora heartbeat to rope river); minor metaphor density in climax ("steam from snowmelt") risks slight overwrite but props propulsion without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax craft into sonic memory-weaving transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in rope-as-tuning-fork feels inevitable, heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
