<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in eye-use recoil ("tore the eye free") versus burial resolve, earning final renunciation with embodied cost in trembling fingers; diagnostic "psychological safety" phrasing slightly abstracts but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build (discovery → amplification → dream → burial), landing CR closure in "safety ... in the truth" with orchard's sigh as felt reconfiguration cost; shards transition legibly without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine's slick paths and storm-battered orchard constrain isolation and burial choice, charging final image ("orchard still swaying") where environment reconfigures solitude into rooted connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens via eye's voices ("silence is just another kind of storm") forcing trade-off renunciation, with dream-chains and lingering fear as legible costs under Accumulative lens; agency coherent in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final realization reweights silence-premise non-literally through burial whisper and orchard sigh, emerging organically from eye-amplified fears without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (soil as "rational, predictable"); rhythmic shortening in "The eye was a liar" heightens recoil pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in image-action fusion ("pressed it to her left socket, wincing as the cold glass settled"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Truth-amplifying relic in post-virus ravine transforms cursed-object trope via involuntary honesty calculus, risking lyric fracture that inevitability charges CR.</comment>
