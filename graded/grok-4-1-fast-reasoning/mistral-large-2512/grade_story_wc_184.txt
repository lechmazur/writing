<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liora's warmly methodical persistence shines in untangling the resistant rope despite shadows, earning her final archival decision with embodied tremble in the vision; minor slip in stock "dismissed myths" phrasing before pivotal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rope reconfiguration accumulates revelations to CR closure—"She would archive the truth"—with conceptual cost of filling erasures legible in door's vanish; shards transition cleanly via brightest braid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanism room's oil-parchment air and shadow-disappearing rope ends constrain her tactile reconfiguration, charging final pulse; selective sensory narrowing under urgency anchors vividly without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover Vaelis erasure tightens accumulatively via rope resistance to vision's obliteration reveal, forcing archival renunciation with felt tremble-cost; single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Absence theme emerges organically from erasure vision to "archive...as a story," reweighting fables without moralizing; final rope pattern offers resonant non-literal answer via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward relics ("fingers tracing edges of history") modulates rhythm under stress; shadow voice carries subtext without naturalism lapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in reconfiguration beat propels via varied syntax, but "braids" loops across three sentences dull micro-propulsion slightly; no closure artifacts, rhythm reads aloud cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rope as time-map for erasure fables transforms hidden-history trope via braid reconfiguration; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in door-vanish CR without late rules.</comment>
