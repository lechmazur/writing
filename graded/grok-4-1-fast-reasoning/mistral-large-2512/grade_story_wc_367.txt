<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via laughter as key vibration and ink-stained past anchoring present joy, with micro-choices like palm-pressing and angle-adjusting revealing values under visionary pressure; minor abstract summary in "this was her motivation" slightly dilutes embodiment before the gesture-mirroring pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from routine climb to vision sharpening via adjustments; Charged Poise closure in "she would step into the light and let it carry her home," reconfiguring her architect role with felt promise/cost of storms, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass lantern and spiral stairs constrain choices (climb, press, adjust) and charge final pulsing image; sensory hierarchy (thrum, flicker, salt-laced dark) filters through herald's priorities, evolving causally with light-warping without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dawn-shaping signaled early tightens accumulatively via accidental vision and ripple-contact, forcing gesture-mirror agency that narrows to bridge-promise with legible cost in overlapping worlds; no reversal overload needed, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of new dawn from ancient shadows emerges organically via ink-fingers parallel and city-roots image shifting to "dreams were the first drafts," offering non-literal resonance without moralizing; final architect stance reweights particulars with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in shadow-weaving diction and laughter-echo rhythm modulates with visionary intensity; stable close-third POV biases toward starlight/whisper priorities, with purposeful lyric compression taught early and paying off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light bent, warping into shapes") propels via varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked figures ("blade of bottled lightning," "whisper between worlds") in opening risks coherence but stays voice-motivated without closure touch or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of newspaper-ink herald to light-loom architect transforms tropes via total internal reflection mechanics and prophetic slip; risk-taking in shadowed elation tone heightens stakes inevitably toward "city waited" image without gimmickry.</comment>
