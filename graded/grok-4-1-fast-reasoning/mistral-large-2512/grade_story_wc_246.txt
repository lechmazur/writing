<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Confidently uncertain trait embodied in shaky hands leaning on Elias and fear of worsening, with contradictory impulses clashing in "What if I make it worse?"; final stance earned via dialogue pressure. Elias as crucible forces micro-choice to unbend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from pen-handling to anomaly pulse and dialogue, culminating in Charged Poise/CR closure: "she was the editor... decide what to keep" reconfigures agency with cost of prior wrong seeds legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pen as micro-setting constrains reflection and charges final slip-back image; anomaly pulses distort time, mirroring internal blur via ozone-bread smell synthesis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (edit warped history) signaled early, deepens via Elias nudge tightening to renunciation of fear; cost felt in fragile confidence, though slightly abstract without sharper reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mutable history as draft/garden emerges organically from seeds-pen-anomaly particulars; final image resonantly reweights "carve in stone" vs. "grow," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature via shifting symbols and bruise-sky anomaly; dialogue subtextual ("early or late") advances with distinct idioms under Accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful pen reprises avoiding loops; minor garden-watercolor figurative density in reflection but pattern-taught without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-warping anomaly and rewriting pen transforms time-distortion trope; inevitable hindsight from seeds to editor-stance, bold lyric sci-fi risk heightens resonance.</comment>
