<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong prism-minded interiority with embodied cues like trembling hands and rustling pages compels discovery stake; final shift to guardian earned via symbol convergence. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak chamber moment for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as threshold effects densify to chamber reveal; CR closure lands on-page in book integration and realization ("she was not just an archivist, but a guardian") with felt cost of inverting hour's end. Orientation anchored early in grotto; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto, mist, inverted stalactites constrain movement (moisture rises, no prints) and charge final image (mist swallows chamber); sensory hierarchy reflects archivist bias toward symbols. Vivid, purposeful integration peaks at pedestal touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgotten combinations) signaled early, escalates via accumulating effects (wind whisper to symbol shift/mist parting) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to book confrontation; agency in approach/opening forecloses hour with visible cost (groan, fading symbols).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance/keys emerges organically from doodle-symbols convergence; final image ("flame in the dark") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting fragments to guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (refracting thoughts, symbol focus); rhythmic lyric voice modulates intensity, peaks crisply at "doodles began to bleed onto the paper." No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; figurative language coherent in pressure beats (e.g., "ink seeming to smolder") without muddle or loops. Minor repetition of "latent blaze" contained; read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted physics, bleeding doodles, symbol guardianship transforms discovery trope; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR, heightening stakes via time-bound convergence.</comment>
