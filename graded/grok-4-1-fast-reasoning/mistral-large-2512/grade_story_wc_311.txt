<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to name fears drives all micro-choices culminating in earned change; interiority embodied in "hollow bones" and light in palm. Internal conflict subtle but present in reaper's denial of memory need versus remembrance compulsion. Minor slip in told motivation line ("That was his motivation"), but does not unearn closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (light, ink, voices) builds to CR closure where page blanks with gold phrase, reweighting premise of silence with Elias's felt lightness as cost. Orientation anchored early (observatory, dusk, Elias); single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dusk light prisms and dome groans constrain naming via scattered light mechanics, charging final beam image. Sensory hierarchy (visual fracturing, vibration in bones) reflects reaper's bias; details evolve causally (light hardens, dome trembles). Micro-setting (atlas lectern, lenses) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through ink rising and monsters responding, narrowing to beam with visible reconfiguration cost in lifted centuries-weight. Agency in pressing hand and whispering forecloses nameless path. One deepening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically via naming and recordings, resonant CR in blank page's gold phrase reweighting "stars do not weep, but they remember" without moralizing. Subtext in sea monsters as fears layers complexity; final image answers question of dead's silence non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (skeletal touch, hollow bones sensing); rhythmic prose modulates from contemplative to charged ("observatory trembled"). No head-hopping or elision; voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light pool in his palm, watching as it hardened"); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax purposeful. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors during buildup ("frayed edges of his patience," "shards of glass"), but pattern consistent and does not muddle peak naming beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reaper naming inked sea monsters via observatory light transforms death trope into remembrance ritual, inevitable in hindsight from recordings cue. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity to CR closure.</comment>
