<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (breath mingling salt air); motivation to preserve rooted in archivist traits compels release with felt cost; minor reflection dominance slightly dilutes on-page micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via images to CR closure in locket drop and glowing water, reweighting preservation premise with conceptual cost legible on final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty sensory-selective (warm planks creak to edge drop) constrains release choice and charges final image; twilight pressures cadence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold vs. release memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to agency in drop foreclosing control path; cost visible in blurred photo fear realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of covenant renewal via loss emerges organically from jetty/locket particulars; final whisper-in-wind image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (small moments' weight) with rhythmic modulation under grief pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density (blooming jetty motif purposeful) in opening but no loops or artifacts dull peak drop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist transforms grief trope via covenant logic; locket release synthesis feels inevitable from particulars, risking quiet CR payoff.</comment>
