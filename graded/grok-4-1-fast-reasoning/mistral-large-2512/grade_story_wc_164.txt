<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via glass hues embodying emotions; contradictory impulses peak in tunnel hesitation ("What if some paths disappeared because they were never meant to be walked?"); earned acceptance at seed chamber forecloses endless quest with felt ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glass path to red emotion to seed CR closure; cost legible in "her heart ached" amid acceptance; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave constrains via narrowing tunnel and responsive walls ("its walls shimmering as if in agreement"); final dome charges closure image; sensory hierarchy (light refraction, thick air) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glass color shifts narrowing to raw emotion; agency in endurance to "some pieces were meant to stay missing" with heart-ache cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inevitable mysteries emerges via particulars (seeds, glass, tunnel); final seed-pocket image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (emotions as swirling hues); rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "The crater glass pulsed... shifting from blue to violet, then to a deep, unsettling red"); no loops, varied rhythm, purposeful lyricism without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (recollectionist, emotion-glass) transformed via textured lyricism into fresh acceptance arc; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
