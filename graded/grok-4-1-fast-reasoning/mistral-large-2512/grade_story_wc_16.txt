<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction peaks in "fingers trembled" yet "voice low and steady," compelling the final speech; interiority particular to linguist without labels; earned endurance forecloses safe silence with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: speaking initiates ink ripple to pulse to crack/voice, culminating in shatter and reconfiguration ("she had begun"); cost legible in remnants and expectant silence at "doors creaked open."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink well as micro-setting constrains all choices, from dipping quill to shattering, charging final "dipped her pen into the air"; sensory selection (fogging breath, iridescent shimmer) filters through Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust via symphonies) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to voice's dare; agency in "unsnared" and final speech forces trade-off, with shatter cost altering options to "path ahead uncertain."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of earned truth emerges via promises/oaths, reweighted non-literally in symphonies singing and lingering essence; resonant without moralizing, though final "promise" image borders overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (syllables as "smoke," "tangled thread") biases toward linguistic texture; rhythmic modulation accelerates at "air thickened"; spectral voice indirection advances stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("curl like smoke, rearranging"); varied rhythm, no loops; minor overwriting in "jagged shadows" string slightly muddles peak shatter but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic magic as covenant/weapon, transformed via Velyrian choice-silencing; "symphonies" premise risks bold payoff in singing eruption, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
