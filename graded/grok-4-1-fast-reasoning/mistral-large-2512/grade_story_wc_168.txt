<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (scars itching, chest tightening) and earned change in Elias's grief softening via notebook moment; contradictory impulses in confronting his own loss while helping stranger. Minor stock phrasing like "shattered dreams" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure. Voices distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box discovery to stranger's scar reveal, culminating in Charged Poise closure as "ink bleeding into the paper" and grief softens with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (Elias on ridge path). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and micro-settings (scars, box, notebook) constrain choices (cradling box, sitting on rock) and charge final image of writing under climbing moon. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pine scent, wind on scars). Details evolve causally with emotional deepening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating irreplaceable loss) signaled early via box note, deepens accumulatively through stranger's story into writing beat narrowing emotional options. Agency in offering notebook forces trade-off with visible cost in shared silence. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting bargains emerges organically from box note, throat scar, and notebook ink "bleeding...like water through cracked earth," reweighting innocence's theft without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to pain's translation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fire patterns, unspoken aftermaths); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell me what you lost") advances stakes. Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, diction POV-apt (calloused fingers, ragged scars).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative peaks in dialogue beats); metaphors purposeful (mercury light, ink bleeding) without muddle in closure. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions but no loops or artifacts touching final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of fire scars and voice bargains transformed via notebook poetry and "rewriting the bargain" image; risk in quiet Charged Poise heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
