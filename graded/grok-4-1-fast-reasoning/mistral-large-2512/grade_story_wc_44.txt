<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in childhood haunting and scholar traits compels key choices like inserting the key and turning it in air; interiority concrete via embodied details like fogged breath and tightening fingers. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ test; endurance of quest feels earned but archetypal without deep flaws complicating peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: key find → dais insertion → descent → mirror revelation → air-turn CR with cost (guardian dissolves, shadows reclaimed). Orientation anchored early (isle, observatory, shadows by para 2); single scene/two shards coherent, closure CR legible on-page with final unbroken shadows image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirrors and lantern shadows constrain revelation and charge final image (noon sun, persistent shadows); sensory selection (ozone, cold, flickering) purposeful and POV-filtered via scholar's rune-tracing attention. Environment evolves causally (dais sinks, dome splits), mirroring internal reclamation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' noon fate) signaled early, tightens causally through key/descents/guardian to agency-driven close-the-loop with felt cost (lost shadows reclaimed). One meaningful escalation sufficient; guardian complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shadows as reclaimable losses emerges organically via mirrors' fragments and final unbroken stretch, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant CR answer: shadows hid in stored absences, now whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scholar-perceptual bias (runes, symbols, shadows); voice textured via rhythmic prose modulating to steady lantern light at end. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("close the loop"), advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in descent/chamber); no loops/artifacts, purposeful shadow repetition charges closure. Precise diction (ozone/old metal) propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-spoon-reality world + noon shadows vanishing yields non-obvious CR (stored absences reclaimed via time-key); risk-taking surreal elements (bent cutlery, moment-mirrors) heighten stakes organically.</comment>
