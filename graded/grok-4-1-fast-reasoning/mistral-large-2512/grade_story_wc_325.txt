<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied as "live wire in his chest, sparking every time a pipe groaned" creates concrete internal conflict that compels descent despite pressure; final kneel to "stand by" earns closure through prior motivation to return what's taken. No major slips, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oriented early via Elias, Blackthorn Deep, seven years post-collapse; causal lens holds as codex path leads to chamber, data slate revelation, wall ripple enabling step-through DC/CR closure with legible cost ("didn’t fight it"). Single scene adheres to defaults; no ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Facility walls "slick with condensation," cables "thick as pythons" constrain descent and charge final "crushing hush"; recurring gold flecks as micro-setting enable invisible path, mirroring internal states through tactile dread. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis; no white-room or generics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to return codex before flood signaled early, escalates causally via vibration and wall ripple narrowing to step-through agency; cost unmistakable in reversal and non-resistance ("gold flecks...winking out"). One tightening sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unremembered echoes emerges via cables' voices and codex absorption without statement; final image "stars swallowed by dawn" offers resonant CR repricing phase transition with conceptual cost of erasure. Complexity lingers in "not to join, but to stand by."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward tactile dread ("pipes groaned"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, e.g., short breaths in descent. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("You came back"); no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("pressure crushed...like eggshells") advancing propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats like wall ripple. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor simile density but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms undersea horror tropes via phase-slip reality fault and codex gold tracking non-spaces; fresh synthesis of cables-as-echoes and reversal inevitability risks bold CR closure without gimmickry.</comment>
