<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to preserve names through sound is consistent and intensifies to compel the pivotal blow into the tube; embodied "foxglove regret" grounds emotion effectively. Internal conflict leans reflective rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, slightly muting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page CR: tube note triggers orchid chime, reweighting purpose with legible emotional cost in softening regret. Orientation anchored early; structure coherent as reflective shards resolving in atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchids and bamboo tube as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details (parchment, metallic air) selectively mirror fragility theme. Library's floating towers ground spatial coherence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recreate chime to preserve names) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed attempts to light-triggered blow narrowing options. Cost felt in partial success softening regret, charging poise without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reviving lost echoes emerges organically from particulars; final chime offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting preservation as "giving them a place to live again." No moralizing, ambiguity in partial success lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature attuned to sound/light fragility; diction/rhythm modulate from descriptive to charged in tube moment. No head-hopping; voice distinct without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors purposeful in lyric mode without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening tower/orchid descriptions slows initial propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-preservation library and extinct feelings transforms trope of haunted archive; tube reprise feels inevitable, risk in quiet CR heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
