<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to tend the unspoken is rooted in his conductor past and shown through persistent micro-choices like yanking the cord despite sputters; embodied reactions (breath hitches, hands tremble) reveal vulnerability under pressure. Girl's appearance forces a subtle shift from unseen tending to witnessed success. Final walk-away renunciation feels earned with solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds from drone to warped lullaby to laughter echo, culminating in Charged Poise RR where blower's death and Elias's exhale mark legible emotional cost in the final image. Continuous single scene with no orientation debt. Lens taught early via wind conduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel and leaf blower as micro-settings constrain sound-warping choices and charge closure image of laughter bouncing back. Sensory focus on sound hierarchy reflects Elias's conductor bias. Details integrate via action (angled blower spirals wind).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via girl/mother appearance and blower sputter tightening density to force stance crystallization in laughter return. Agency in adjustments/yanks drives one decisive deepening; cost legible in fuel exhaustion altering outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of imperfections allowing joy emerges organically from off-key wind/cracks motif shifting to self-playing symphony; final image reconfigures tending unspoken without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like warped acoustics avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; voice texture modulates rhythm from roar to gasp, heightening pressure. No elision or head-hopping; diction purposeful and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sensory propulsion integrates action without loops, though opener's "macerated" metaphor borders density excess. Clean syntax, no scaffolds; final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesis of leaf-blower conduction transforms music-healing trope via tunnel acoustics and off-key imperfections; risk in haunting joy payoff feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
