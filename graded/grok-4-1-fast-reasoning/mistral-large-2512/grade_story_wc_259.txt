<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to purify patterns roots consistently in historian traits, intensifying via embodied nostalgia sparks; contradictory longing vs. avoidance acts in scene through unpredictable navigation. Boy Kael forces relational micro-choice, revealing her recognition of Veythi echo. Final letting-go earned by prior buildup, but epiphany "She understood" borders unearned directness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from archive pulses to swirling nostalgia storm, culminating in CR closure—"walls dissolving into light"—with legible conceptual cost of self-purification. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt; boy sighting motivates ellipsis to pagoda without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully: obsidian walls/moss pulse as lived crucible, constraining via pattern-response that guides Elara's tactics; pagoda charges final image by shimmering/reacting. Sensory hierarchy (tactile sparks, sighing voices) biases through historian POV, evolving causally with walls shifting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify vs. nostalgia pull) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via boy remnant and pagoda activation narrowing to realization; agency in following/touching forecloses pursuit path. Escalation coheres as density reweights options, but boy coincidence complicates without full agency test at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of order's doom vs. living memory emerges organically from particulars like pattern traps and Kael's wisdom, resonating in non-literal CR ending where grasping hands reweights nostalgia as present force. Subtext layers via archive's reversal; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in purification twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (atoms brushing skin, dead languages); poetic diction/rhythm modulates intensity, distinct from sparse dialogue. Kael's "You have to let go" carries natural subtext under stress; no head-hopping, voice biases toward mystical specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid rhythm—"thousand voices sighing"—varying syntax without loops; figurative language purposeful in accumulative texture, not muddling peak. Minor overwriting in "fractured rainbows that danced" risks density slip pre-climax, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient archive manifesting remnants transforms lost-civ trope via atoms of nostalgia constraining choices. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in reversal where purification backfires inevitably; no template echoes, particulars like Veythi Kael echo feel organic.</comment>
