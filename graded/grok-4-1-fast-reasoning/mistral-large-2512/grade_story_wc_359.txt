<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eira's synesthetic perception and motivation to certify wonder drive micro-choices like ringing despite chisel disruptions, with embodied conflict in flinching and trembling hands. Internal contradiction between persistence and chaos is dramatized on-page. Minor reflection on motivation feels slightly told rather than fully earned in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note colors build density, chisel strikes create pattern breaks, culminating in RR closure where music unfurls and silences sculptor with felt cost of her determination. Single scene oriented early in ice cavern. Closure cost legible in "final, determined strike" reconfiguring chaos to hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain choices by enabling color-weaving while amplifying chisel echoes. Sensory details like pulsing veins and vibrating walls evolve with melody, mirroring internal states. Recurring bells as micro-setting charge final white note image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release music amid disruptions) tightens accumulatively via escalating chisel strikes shattering notes, forcing endurance agency. Visible cost in trembling hands and gritted teeth alters persistence tactics. Climax trade-off legible but lacks deeper option foreclosure beyond success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's necessity emerges organically from hush vs. chaos conflict, resonating in final cascade of unseen hues reminding of stillness's beauty. Subtext in color blooms/shatters avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with synesthetic perceptual signature: sounds bloom as colors, modulating rhythm with intensity. Prose texture distinct in fluid, light-woven syntax. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull momentum. Purposeful poetic figurative language like "curling around her like smoke" supports voice without muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringing via aurora transforms fantasy tropes into fresh, inevitable synthesis where colors sculpt sound. Bold risk in "sculpted hush" concept heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise feels singular.</comment>
