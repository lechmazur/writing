<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("pulse quicken," "breath caught"); micro-choices under pressure (kneeling amid vibration, staying through tremor) reveal values with earned endurance at closure. Final realization bends prior caution into resilient stance, foreclosing flight with felt planetary cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (hum, pulse, echoes) to CR closure where arrow cools and seeds drift, reweighting resilience premise with undeniable inversion cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Selective details (silver waterway, trembling leaves, slick arches) constrain navigation and charge grove discovery; floating arches mirror internal bend in climax tremor, evolving causally with inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to echoes/tremor; agency in staying narrows options, cost legible in skiff lifting and grove's bursting endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from echoes ("We endure") and final seeds-as-stars image reweighting change-as-bending without statement; resonance inextricable from Lira's arc and grove's accelerant contrast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with pilot-biased perception (winds, water flow); rhythmic prose modulates from sputter to swell, perceptual signature vivid under inversion stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "arrow tip grew warm" cueing echoes); varied rhythm accelerates to climax tremor without loops or overwriting, propulsion peaks in seed-drift image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, buried settler echoes, accelerant groves transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in solo endurance amid planetary flip inevitable via arrow/soil causality.</comment>
