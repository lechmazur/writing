<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jace's motivation as relic mailman compels endurance with clear traits shown in handling undeliverable letters; Mira's arrival forces micro-choice revealing values. Internal conflict in recognizing shared defiance layers contradictions without summary. Minor abstract emotion phrasing like "quiet rebellion" slightly dilutes embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from arcade hum to rain tapping, culminating in Charged Poise closure: tucking bottle with letters reconfigures carrying as endurance with felt weight/cost. Orientation anchors early via Jace, Veyra border, twilight arcade. One tightening via Mira's drop announcement narrows to risky aid without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Neon glow, drone buzz, swirling mist in bottle constrain choices (arcade as safe drop site) and charge final tuck-in image. Sensory hierarchy (visual shadows to tactile rain) reflects Jace's priorities, integrated via action. Twilight border liminality mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering hope via undeliverable mail/smuggling signaled early, tightens accumulatively with jammer activation and rain onset forcing stance. Agency in endurance forecloses normalcy with bag's heavier weight as cost. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises via carrying absences emerges from letters, smuggling, bottle without statement; final lines offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting permanence illusion. Subtext in Mira's defiance and drone shadows invites ambiguity on rebellion's cost. Particulars like smudged address avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd Jace POV with perceptual signature (neon shadows as wavering secrets); diction/rhythm modulates from hum to tapping hush. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("some storms aren’t meant to be unleashed") pursues goals distinctly. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "weight...pressing against his ribs like a secret"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors consistent (bleeding ink, knife drone) enhance without muddle. Read-aloud ear clean, propulsion peaks in final tuck-in.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of border mailman smuggling "absences" via drone, thunderstorm bottle as carried storm transforms relic trope organically. Final reconfiguration of promises feels inevitable from particulars. Minor proximity to liminal-space archetype but elevated by specific defiance.</comment>
