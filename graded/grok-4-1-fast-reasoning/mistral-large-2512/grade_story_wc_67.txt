<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses to chase vs. outrun emotion act in mask vision and ash-scattering; final renunciation earned by prior pigment-ash mixing and promise, with visible cost of self-recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (chair, mask, portrait) builds to CR closure; portrait face reveal reconfigures inheritance with undeniable conceptual cost of perpetual incompletion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery and rocking chair constrain pursuit (hollow promises, creaking signals presence) and charge final settling image, with sensory selectivity mirroring disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to crystallize emotion deepens accumulatively via mask vision revelation, forcing agency in ash-scattering renunciation; cost unmistakable in self-faced portrait and mask discard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fragments/incompleteness theme emerges organically; self-portrait resolution reweights evasion motif as personal trap without moralizing, inviting complex after-reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (breathing paintings, biting shards) biases toward haunted artistry; rhythmic diction modulates intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density integrates action-imagery (e.g., "warmth lingered" propels revelation) with varied rhythm, no overwriting in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashes-in-pigments and self-revealing portrait synthesize inheritance/haunting into fresh, inevitable twist; risk of surreal vision heightens stakes organically.</comment>
