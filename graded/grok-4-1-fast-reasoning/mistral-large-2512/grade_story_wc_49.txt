<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied warmth/pulse syncing with heartbeat and voice-cracking persistence under arbor hush; final sharing choice earned by prior isolation/scoffing hints, revealing values hierarchy with village cost. Mild flaw: contradictory impulses subtle rather than simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build (tendril pulse → unfurl → glow) to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored by ~50 words (Liora/arbor/dawn/tendril); exact cost legible in "scoff at first, but... tendrils would creep," reconfiguring her solitary path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arbor's spirals/tree bark constrain palm-press/song trigger and charge final hush/glow image; sensory mint/earth/lullaby hierarchy reflects tinker's whimsical bias; no generic placeholders, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax/restore via song) signaled early, deepens via tendril responses narrowing to glow/understanding under Accumulative lens; agency in persistent singing forecloses doubt with felt voice-crack cost, charging final mission image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of earth's memory vs. village forgetting emerges via tendril/song particulars, resonating in leaf keepsake/walk-back image reweighting isolation without moral; earned via struggle, invites ambiguity on villager response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-3rd POV with tinker-biased perceptual signature (trinkets as rainbows/fireflies); rhythmic modulation peaks at hush/glow without leakage; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tendril tightened... as if in answer" advances plot/character); varied rhythm/syntax propels to glow peak without loops/artifacts; minor figurative density ("cathedral of leaves"/"emerald arches") purposeful for tone, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinker-dreamer coaxing vine magic via song transforms folklore tropes organically; risk in lyric hush-build heightens stakes; no close famous echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
