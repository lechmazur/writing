<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via moonstone pulsing with heartbeat and hesitation before kneeling; Liora's exile motivation compels the tattoo choice with felt cost of criminality. Minor slip: man's traits shown via tattoos/voice but lack contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from arrival to tattoo; Charged Poise closure in "exiles together" line reconfigures solitude with criminal cost legible on page. Orientation anchored early in garden/sea; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss-slick stones and salt breeze tactilely constrain barefoot stance and tattoo site; twilight-to-dark evolution mirrors internal shift, charging final wind/storm image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nostalgia ban violation) signaled in hesitation, tightens via moonstone burn forcing kneel; density escalation reweights exile solitude into shared criminality with on-page cost. Agency in finger-dance forecloses solo path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silenced memory emerges via tattoo reviving old tides, resonant in final stillness/breaking waves laugh without moralizing. Moonstone reprise reweights gaps-stars motif organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual bias in tide/gap noticing; dialogue subtextual ("my next verse") advances goal with distinct rough/poetic idioms. Rhythm modulates to peak tattoo gasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonstone speck burned hotter" advances emotion/causality); minor figurative density in tattoo beat ("curling into waves") borders overwrite but pattern-taught. Varied syntax propels without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ban-tattoo exile transforms nostalgia trope; sky-inked man and tide-finger dance feel inevitable, risk-taking in poetic world logic heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
