<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like tracing puddle reflections to find the hatch, reveal Lira's resourceful traits consistently; final stance to "hold the line" earns closure via prior causality without unearned epiphanies. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from key to puddle map to upload; on-page Decisive Change at "press *ENTER*" lands with felt cost as enforcers burst in, reconfiguring erasure into broadcast ripple. Orientation anchors early; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and puddles constrain choices by guiding to hatch and recharge final image of shifting reflections; sensory details like "damp metal and old secrets" integrate purposefully through action. Vivid, POV-filtered without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to expose revisions tightens causally via solo push after betrayal, culminating in enforcer intrusion narrowing options; agency in upload/press shows trade-off cost as she faces rifles. One decisive escalation suffices, legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs rewriting emerges organically through screens' "*YOU WERE NEVER HERE*" to broadcast crack; final image of gold path and new maps offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting indifference as spark.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct perceptual signature in light/water distortions; rhythmic prose modulates tension purposefully, peaking crisply at chamber intrusion without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative language like "liquid fire" purposeful, not muddled, supporting atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Minor elevated diction in reflections risks slight register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-map navigation and server-erasure premise transforms dystopian tropes via grounded specifics; risk in lyric water motif heightens closure image of new rebels without gimmickry.</comment>
