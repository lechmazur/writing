<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in unused love's weight driving the gift to the man; embodied via chest tightening and trembling fingers. Final realization earned through parallel past/present kneelings. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing at "the place where unused love was stored."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory shards and breathing patterns builds to CR closure where love's storage reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost in final image. Man's fog-emergence motivated by her breath; on-page anchors viaduct/twilight by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct's damp stones and wisteria constrain kneeling choice; fog responds to breath, charging final swirl reveal. Recurrent camera obscura inverts inner world, mirroring states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused love's location) signaled in opening question; man's arrival deepens via parallel grief, forcing gift with felt cost in her second heartbeat. Agency in "Breathe" crystallizes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from jade tear's passage and spark breaths; final image non-literally answers question, reweighting love as transferable without stated moral. Resonance in father's eased shoulders echoes her release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-bending souls and spark breaths; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "Breathe." Stable single POV with clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in opening metaphors purposeful for textural build; no loops, propulsion via varied syntax accelerates to climax. Minor figurative density ("spine of stone") contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura communion and breathing sparks transforms spiritual healing trope; jade tear's glow reweights past life organically. Risky lyric density pays off in charged poise.</comment>
