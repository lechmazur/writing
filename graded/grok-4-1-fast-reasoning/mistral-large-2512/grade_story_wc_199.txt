<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in seed-sorting precision, driving leaf arrangement; embodied changes like moss-stained hands and vine-tangled hair reveal transformation under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning toward unearned epiphany at "suddenly, she understood." Final endurance as folklore figure feels earned but passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single speck to multiplying dust, dream transformation, and monument crumble to CR closure in leaf shower and villager discovery. Orientation anchored early (Veyth, arbor, Liora). Pivotal tightening at prodding pebble spiral releases dust, changing knowledge with transformation cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor vividly selective (rustling branches, damp earth, falling leaves), constraining choices like kneeling, plucking, monument-building. Recurring monuments and body (stained hands) charge final image; sensory hierarchy reflects pattern-seeking POV. No spatial incoherence despite time shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaf patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via speck multiplication and dust release narrowing to understanding. Agency in prodding and arranging forces trade-off (personal transformation). Cost felt in softened edges and moss-clinging sleeves charging villager scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of order-from-chaos emerges organically via seed-sorting to leaf language, monuments to forgotten; final image of mossy Liora sorting leaves reweights without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like pebble spiral crumble avoids platitudes. Invites ambiguity in folklore integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (pattern obsession in "rhythms that defied randomness"); voice lyrical, rhythmic, modulating to charged poise at leaf shower. Purposeful compression in dream shard legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plucked the leaf, turning it in her palm" advances plot, reveals character); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in poetic density during peak ("leaves rained down in a shower of light") but purposeful for textural lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore arbor as leaf-language oracle with seed-sorter's pattern quest; transforms ghost-echo trope into dormant memories. Risky lyric shards pay off in transformed closure; irreplaceable skyborne specificity avoids generics.</comment>
