<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's face-blind tactility drives micro-choices like tracing ribbon and sketch integration; final commitment to lance earns change via embodied pulse/sweat. Methodical trait shown holistically without overload; figure's pressure reveals relational crucible effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via ribbon-lance-mist buildup to Charged Poise closure in "Liora's face was finally whole," with empathy cost legible in firm grip. Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist/jagged quarry constrains visibility and choices (rustle freeze, edge stand); charges final sketch as tactile micro-setting. Sensory tactility via fogged lenses/face-blind bias perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeing forgotten) deepens accumulatively via lance reveal narrowing to empathy renunciation; agency in taking lance forecloses detachment with sweat-slick cost on-page.</comment>
