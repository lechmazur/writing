<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's persistent curiosity drives micro-choices like kneeling to the floor and stepping into mist despite warnings, earning her final embrace with embodied tension (breath hitched, fingers tightened). Internal conflict between curiosity and fear acts simultaneously without alternation. Minor stock phrasing ("fragile as the mist") slightly dulls distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mounting pulses, mist density, and voice layers tightening to Charged Poise closure where Lena smiles amid louder chorus, reconfiguring her stance with undeniable personal cost ("they'll take you"). Single scene causality links hearing aid to Elias to Miriam seamlessly. Orientation anchors early (atrium, job, photo).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist constrains choices by thickening/coiling and recoiling at touch, charging final image; glass drips, marble cold, and fountain anchor tactile spatiality through POV-filtered hearing urgency. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory pulses amid visual mist. Evolving environment mirrors internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace/protect Miriam escalates accumulatively: faint pulse to frantic drumbeat to voice chorus, narrowing options via Elias's warning and mist recoil. Agency in adjusting aid, reaching out, and running forces trade-off, with cost legible ("they'll take you," yet she persists).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of protecting unheard voices emerges organically from pulses, vanishings, and final chorus needing Lena, reweighting curiosity as heroism without statement. Miriam's whisper ("echoes of the ones who were never heard") and Lena's smile offer non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers in open cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with hearing-biased perceptual signature (static rasp, pulse sync); sparse dialogue carries subtext ("Neither should you") and advances via warning. Rhythmic diction modulates from hush to drumbeat under stress, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "adjusted the volume... crackling like static" advances tool/atmosphere); varied rhythm breathes with escalation, zero loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("dripped with twilight") integrates without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hearing aid as pulse-tracker transforms ghost-hospital trope into fresh "hearts" tracer premise, with voices as memory-cracks yielding incidental heroism. Bold risk in accumulative supernatural density heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early photo/curiosity setup.</comment>
