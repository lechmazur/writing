<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via stained fingers and unheard notes reveals copyist's isolation driving dust revival; micro-choice to hum lyrics earns final laugh. Minor stock phrasing like "breath caught" slightly generic but doesn't touch closure. Contradictory endurance of silence yields to brittle joy with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: radio song fragments accumulate to dust speech as RR/Charged Poise, reconfiguring silence with cost in "brittle but real" laugh vs. indifferent mist. Orientation anchored early in alcove. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final smile line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember alcove's damp ash and dust corners constrain gathering action; recurring jar dust charges closure image of shimmering "Listen." Mist outside subtly pressures isolation. Sensory hierarchy fits copyist's notice of forgotten hollows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive stories via dust) signaled early, tightens via lyrics method to on-page speech; agency in humming forecloses passive waiting. Accumulative density escalates to reweight options, cost felt in worn life but charged poise at end. Minor abstract famine scale lacks one visceral scene test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remnants reviving voice emerges via dust-as-stories, final "Listen" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in elusive lyrics vs. concrete glow invites ambiguity on world's hearing. No tidy resolution; mist indifference lingers as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via musical fragments ("mouse in the walls") biases notice. Rhythm modulates from hushed to swelling song without drift. Compression of song payoff purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful figures like "liquid gold" integrate without muddle in peak dust glow. Propulsion peaks at "first word formed," varying sentences. Minor simile density ("smoke," "mirage," "tiny storm") controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine and dust animation via pirate song transforms post-silence trope; risk in lyric calm heightens conceptual stakes. Final dust voice inevitable from copyist skill, no derivative echoes.</comment>
