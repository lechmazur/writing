<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied (cold sweat, pulsing luminance behind eyes), with contradictory fear/curiosity driving micro-choices like pressing the palm. Advisor applies relevant pressure without dominating agency. Final renunciation of cloak feels earned by prior causality, though advisor's guidance borders on over-helpful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mirror distortions and advisor whispers builds to RR closure when reflection recoils from Elias's touch, reconfiguring fear with felt cost (cloak as accusation). Orientation anchored early (funhouse entry). No ambiguity; persistent luminance constraint shapes tactics through climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain pivotal choice (pressing palm) and charge final image (smooth glass). Sensory details selective and purposeful (rust/caramel air, splintered booth), filtered through dread. Micro-objects like clasp evolve tactilely, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront hollow self/fear) signaled early, escalates via lunging reflection and advisor's "starve it," narrowing to agency-driven deepening (study/press). Cost legible in recoiling mirror and unclasped cloak. Minor: advisor nudge slightly eases pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fear's self-deception emerges organically from dictionary paradoxes and mirror lunge/recoil, with final Polaroid tear reweighting premise non-literally. Advisor whispers carry subtext without overt moralizing. Resonance strong but advisor lines ("Fear’s weakness is curiosity") verge on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (warped reflections as dread bias). Prose rhythm modulates tension (short panic sentences at lunge). Advisor dialogue distinct (threadbare murmurs) and goal-driven; no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "mirrors seemed to ripple in response" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels (read-aloud flows); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak (palm press). Zero figurative excess in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cursed Polaroid + paradoxical dictionary transform funhouse trope into fear-tricking ingenuity, with clasp/Polaroid reprise feeling inevitable. Bold risk in advisor's ethereal pressure heightens without gimmick. No derivative echoes; closure turn grows from particulars.</comment>
