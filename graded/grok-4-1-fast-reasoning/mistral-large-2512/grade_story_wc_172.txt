<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amoral philanthropist traits root motivation consistently, with sentimental contradiction embodied in drought creation versus release; drawer backstory anchors present hesitation effectively without flattening pressure. Final renunciation earned by causal buildup of echo preservation. Minor label-speak in "secretly sentimental" slightly undercuts interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (drought agency, map reading) tightens to CR closure where phone-tap release reconfigures echo's vessel with legible conceptual cost in receding salt/returning rivers. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single shard, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains path via crystalline crust and converging cracks-as-map, charging final kneeling image; sensory selection (sinking boots, static air) reflects Elias's priorities. Details evolve causally with release decision, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening of drought's artificiality narrowing to release trade-off; agency in phone-tap forecloses drought-path with felt cost in echo's reconfiguration. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo preservation theme emerges from particulars (egg warmth, manufactured drought, sister photo) reweighted in final image of left-behind egg amid returning wet; non-literal resonance in cruel sentiment avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in echo/ghost motifs and biased noticing (salt as pristine); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate steps to sharp exhale under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "egg... hummed with ghost of song" advances character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts in peak release beat. Minor overwriting in repeated "echo" unchained by pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Manufactured drought for extinct echo synthesizes fresh premise organically, transforming preservation trope via sentimental cruelty; risk in ironic reversal (erase flats to save echo) heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
