<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia deeply integrated into perception and motivation, shaping micro-choices like tracing coin and recognizing library by textures; final renunciation earned via lifelong pursuit shown in "mirror the sky inside walls." Internal conflict subtle but embodied in reverence vs. possession at "She would not take it," with contradictory impulses (desire to capture vs. revere) acting in the closing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (coin/map) to revelation (sketch) to CR closure in "She understood then why the guild had hidden it away," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of uncontainable sky; orientation anchored early ("tree trunk library"); one tightening via map-following to safe suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via shadows obscuring shelf and dawn glow pressuring exit; body/tools (coin, wax, key) tactile and lived-in ("ran her fingers along the spines"); fractal sky sketch charges final image, mirroring internal limits; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hollows, rhythms over faces).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (possess perfect sky capture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to renunciation foreclosing ownership path; cost legible in refusal and demolition dawn ("first faint glow"); agency via deliberate quest culminates in stance crystallization without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of capture's limits emerges organically from prosopagnosia, negative-space art, and sketch realization, reweighting "mirror the sky" want; final image ("this place, this moment, would remain") offers non-literal CR answer with ambiguity (reverence's cost vs. loss); no moralizing, resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (spaces, shadows, rhythms); rhythmic prose modulates stillness to tightening pulse ("her pulse steady"); diction character-bound (artist's eye for unseen); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "spines... whisper of a life" advances setting/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm suits stillness, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (fractals as vessel), coherent without muddle; minor overwriting in descriptive peaks but propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia portraitist seeking fractal sky via coin-map in tree-library fresh synthesis, transforming tropes (quest, relic) through limits theme; risk in quiet CR renunciation inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes, bold perceptual angle heightens ingenuity.</comment>
