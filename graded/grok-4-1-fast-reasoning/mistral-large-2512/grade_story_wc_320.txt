<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in patterns drives concrete micro-choices like pressing the shard and retuning; interiority embodied in pulse and breath. Earned change via discarding assumptions forecloses linear search with transcendence cost. Minor abstraction in "understood then" realization slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly builds to hush and CR where Mira transcends via silence, reweighting origins as illusions. Orientation anchored early in tower/gorge. Closure cost legible in tower's fall and her absence amid wreckage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower and gorge constrain climax as perigee strains girders, forcing endurance amid fall; recurring platform charges transcendence image. Sensory hierarchy (hum, groan, glow) reflects Mira's signal focus. Micro-setting via interpreter and shard guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origins quest) signaled early; textural escalation deepens via voice, retuning, hush—agency narrows to silence over signal. One tightening forecloses search path; cost felt in tower collapse charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (beginnings as disguised endings) emerges organically via voice, realization, circular time—final image of fading shard reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars like hush avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: cosmic patterns, signals bias noticing. Prose texture distinct in syntax/rhythm ("groaning under... relentless pull"); modulates serene to intense. Voice ancient/older distinct from Mira's practical interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in peak (hush deepens, screen dark). Purposeful lyric repetition ("shard of hush," "serenely electric") taught early pays off texturally. Minor overwriting in "universe remembering itself" risks purple but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hollywood relic decodes cosmic hush in falling tower transforms signal-trope into origin-illusion CR. Risky fantasy practicality heightens transcendence stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from pattern-matching anomaly/shard.</comment>
