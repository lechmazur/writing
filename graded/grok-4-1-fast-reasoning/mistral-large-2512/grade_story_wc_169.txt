<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via pattern-obsession and embodied vibrations in chest; earned realization from prior actions, but early trait labels slightly undercut contradiction in peak dream beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from gauge discovery to shell patterns to activation; CR closure lands cleanly in "the work had only just begun" with conceptual cost of endless equation-solving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's quartz glow, tide lapping, and shells constrain decoration choices and charge final bridge image; sensory hierarchy matches Elara's mathematical bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope-equations signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dream and needle movement narrowing to bridge-realization; agency in patterns forces stance with felt ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope-as-pattern emerges organically from gauge/shell motifs reweighted in CR ending; resonant non-literal answer in final smile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mathematical noticing (Fibonacci spirals); rhythmic control heightens serene pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel forward; minor overwriting in fractal descriptions doesn't touch closure, but selective vividness shines in gauge hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trial balloons and parallel timelines via tactile grotto math transforms hope trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at closure.</comment>
