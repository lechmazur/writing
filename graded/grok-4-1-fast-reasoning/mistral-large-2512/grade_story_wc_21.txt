<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognition and archival drive compel risks like ignoring Rourke's warning and arranging the parley message, earning her ledger retrieval with relational cost via Lila's alliance. Lila applies targeted pressure as lover/guardian, forcing Elara's trust micro-choice. Minor slip: quick trust in Lila lacks one contradictory impulse in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: diary vision → beach parley → lagoon cavity → chase/escape. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final image of lagoon swallowing pursuers while zeppelin ascends, reweighting truth's fragility with conceptual cost ("past...waited beneath the dunes"). Orientation anchored early; shards taught via "Three days earlier."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choices (wading, key cavity) and charges final image as living prison. Zeppelin library's brass shelves and microfilm evoke tactile history, mirroring Elara's priorities; dunes' debris enables parley. Sensory mix (salt/gun oil, cold water) filters via POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Miriam's truth) signaled early, tightens causally via parley summoning Lila/men and lagoon churn forcing sprint. Agency in debris message and key use forecloses safe retreat with on-page cost (chase). Escalation coheres under causal lens, men as complication via prior conspiracy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unburyable past emerges via lagoon as retrocognitive trap, culminating in CR where ledgers' safety reweights suppression's endurance without moralizing. Subtext in Lila's wait and Miriam's warning layers ambiguity on justice's cost. Final line ("waited beneath the dunes") resonantly answers without literalism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual bias (smudged glasses, trembling fingers). Voice texture via rhythmic prose ("water cold as a corpse’s touch") modulates tension. Dialogue subtextual (Lila's "too late" evades full truth); distinct idiolects in Lila's flinty brevity vs. Elara's hitching breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density: lines like "boots crunching on sand, the scent of salt and gun oil" advance image/action/atmosphere. Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences in chase); no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening ("quiet weight of history, brass shelves groaning") but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zeppelin library + retrocognitive lagoon synthesize civil rights archive with supernatural trap ingeniously, transforming suppression trope via 1963 conspiracy bleeding into present. Risky Causal/CR closure heightens stakes; fresh inflections like debris parley feel inevitable from diary's cipher-map.</comment>
