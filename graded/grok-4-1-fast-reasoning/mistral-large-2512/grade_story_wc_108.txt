<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (phobia "gnaw[ing] at her ribs," "pulse hammering") and micro-choices under pressure (lunge despite fear) earn the change to embracing vulnerability; caretaker forces relational crucible. Minor slip in repetitive epiphany phrasing ("betrayal... sharpened her" echoed later as "remade her") borders label-speak but doesn't unmotivate closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens (shell murmurs → desk/cast → notes decryption → floorboard/photo reveal → confrontation) holds with on-page Charged Poise closure ("let’s start over") reconfiguring relationship/identity; cost legible in caretaker's "I tried to protect you" and Mira's unflinching gaze. Orientation anchored early (Mira in rusted library under stars); single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp paper/rust smell, groaning shelves, starlight) constrain choices (back to desk despite creak, pry floorboard); final stars "burn[ing] brighter" charge closure image. POV-filtered (Mira traces ink through phobia-tinged hands); no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover shell/truth) signaled early, escalates causally via caretaker intrusion/photo (narrows to personal betrayal, forecloses escape/denial); agency in lunge/press shell/pry board shows trade-off with fear cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of betrayal remaking via vulnerability emerges organically through photo reveal and final unflinching exchange; final image answers without stating fully. Overt lines ("vulnerability wasn’t weakness. It was the only thing that had ever made her strong") verge on moralizing, softening resonance slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (metaphoric texture like "whispers slithering"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You hear it too," "I tried to protect you") advances plot. Rhythm modulates tension; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, strong verbs); metaphors purposeful/consistent (shipwrecked hull, whetstone blade). Minor paraphrase loop in betrayal motif ("sharpened... remade") and figurative density in opener dull slightly but don't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-double phobia, whispering shell as auditory map, notes-on-cast decryption transforms betrayal trope into identity remake; photo reveal feels inevitable from causal chain. No close template echoes; bold image convergence (stars) heightens without gimmick.</comment>
