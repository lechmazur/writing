<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to salvage purity drives concrete micro-choices like visiting descendants, with internal conflict embodied in her handling of the snow globe; earned renunciation at closure ("She would never tell") forecloses exposure path with felt cost. Minor telling in "She weaves truth carefully" diagnostic without full embodiment slightly limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments (dream, descendants) build density to pattern break (sabotage reveal), cadence shift in ghost's "Ask the ones who lived" delivers CR closure with conceptual cost of silence on-page. Orientation anchored early via shrine; shards transition legibly without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow globe as micro-setting constrains choices (cupped for vision, placed back) and charges final ripple/tear image; glacier shrine's ice breath/candlelight sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's perceptual urgency. Details purposeful, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pure salvage vs. ugly truth) signaled early, tightens via fragment accumulation to deepening (sabotage), forcing renunciation agency; cost legible in "Some windows...stay closed." One meaningful escalation sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths emerges organically from fragments to CR ("truth woven...into her bones"); final ghost exchange offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like cameos drive subtext over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (symbols, echoes); voice rhythmic/mythic modulates with pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Was it worth it?"); no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels; no loops/artifacts dull closure—e.g., snow globe reprise clean. Minor elevated diction ("salvager of echoes") fits voice without drift; purposeful compression enhances ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost whisperer via dream cameos transforms wreck-diver trope; sabotage twist/silence closure feels inevitable from fragments. Bold mythic tone risks poeticism but coheres without gimmick.</comment>
