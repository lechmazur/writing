<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in trembling fingers and shallow breath yielding to flow; contradictory fatigue/hope acts in first stroke; final endurance earned with visible cost of sleeplessness confronting isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from insomnia to painting to distribution decision; Charged Poise closure in rolling paintings and moonlight certainty reconfigures hope with felt endurance cost; anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse as fragile bubble constrains against smog, filters perception; moon glow and brush charge final image, mirroring internal shift; sensory selection (wet earth/mint vs. city groan) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture kindness via art) signaled early, textural escalation in stroke flow and face accumulation narrowing to distribution; agency in methodical painting forecloses isolation with legible cost of public vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kindness-as-language emerges organically from painted strangers and quote; final image of paintings-for-strangers offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting lost-connection premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (moonlight/ink as secrets) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from tense to humming possibility; diction reflects painter's stubborn poise under fatigue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., brush origin integrates history/mystery); varied rhythm passes ear test; minor figurative density (wool smog, liquid silver) purposeful without muddle in peak painting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomniac art therapy via relic brush transforms isolation trope; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens kindness stakes organically.</comment>
