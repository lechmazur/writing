<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to liberate truth intensifies through micro-choices like hesitating with dice and prying the hatch, rooted in traits shown via journal encryption; Kael pressures via dance. Minor abstraction in "lyrical code" dilutes embodiment slightly, but final endurance earned with cost of sinking lab.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vibrations/dice to dance/journal alignment, culminating in Charged Poise closure as Elara enters chamber amid rising water—"The water would rise... secrets would endure"—with undeniable conceptual cost of lab's fall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains via seeping cracks and fused hatch pried open; bioluminescent algae and vibrations charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile tremors first) reflects Elara's precision under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate truth) signaled early, tightens via dance decoding dice rolls (4-2, then 6-1 coordinates); agency in final roll/hatch forces endurance trade-off with sinking pressure legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of enduring secrets via encrypted agency emerges organically from journal/dice/dance particulars; final chamber image reconfigures vulnerability-strength tension without statement—"secrets would endure. And so would she."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (walls' "whisper[s] of the ocean’s patience"); rhythmic modulation heightens under stress, as in urgent dance description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy rolls amid lyrical swells), coherent metaphors (dice as "promise—or a threat"); no loops/artifacts, propels to closure without overwriting in peak hatch moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghostly dance as code-key transforms haunted lab trope via dice-journal synthesis; risky lyric compression feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
