<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Compassionate recluse shines in gentle hands and festering regret over the woman, driving the final decision to act; internal conflict between hiding and following feels embodied in the clutched invitation moment. Kept empathetic trait constrains choice without labels dominating. Minor slip in therapy-speak regret summary slightly dulls peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from invitation discovery to midnight chime, yielding Charged Poise closure as Elias steps out map in hand—cost legible in forsaking solitude. Orientation anchors library/who/when by para 2. Single scene fits defaults perfectly; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impossible spiral shelves and humming books constrain path to *The Art of Vanishing*, charging final map grasp; sensory details like parchment/beeswax filter through recluse's devoted gaze. Specificity mirrors internal shift without catalog. Environment guides pivotal paradox section choice seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hide vs unearth truth in mistake) tightens via realization—"some mistakes were meant to be unmade"—forcing renunciation of stasis with heart-pounding cost under Accumulative lens. Agency in reaching for book and stepping out forecloses safe path. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom in unmade mistakes emerges organically from invitation echo and map path to woman's house, resonating in final "leaving" image without statement. Particulars like alchemical paradoxes reweight "staying while leaving" principle. Invites ambiguity on regret's payoff, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward book textures and regrets, stable without slips; rhythmic modulation builds to "enlarged tranquility" close. No dialogue to judge. Compression in paradox section feels voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short chime sentence accelerating to decision; high density in sensory integrations advances all layers. Minor paraphrase loop in invitation gnawing/regret (paras 4-5) dulls slightly but misses closure. Clean syntax, no artifacts in peak midnight beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical library regrets and time-reversed books transforms recluse trope via "truth where you leave" pivot, inevitable in hindsight from nested paradoxes. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
