<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to thread his story from father's lies intensifies credibly through micro-choices like tracing the ledger and speaking his name at climax, earning the renunciation of hush with embodied cost (lattice burning). Interiority particular via hush as rib-pressing weight. Minor slip: subtle internal contradiction shown more in endurance than simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds from hallway creak to throat-coiling noose, culminating in CR at "The hush recoiled. The lattice in his pocket shattered" with legible cost (escape amid unspooling labyrinth). Orientation anchored early (lighthouse reef, confessional lattice). Single scene coherent, one tightening via shape's hover.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (copper air, groaning hinge, warped floorboards) filters through Elias's hush-chasing bias, constraining choices (nudges ajar door, approaches swaying one). Lantern room glass/panes charge final beam flicker. Micro-setting (lattice splinters) mirrors internal state, evolving causally to shatter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break paternal hush via truth-threading) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from ledger revelation to shape's approach narrowing options. Speaking name shows agency in renunciation with on-page cost (shattered lattice forecloses confessional prop). Climax hush recoil charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth shattering inherited silence emerges organically from particulars (scratched-out name, recoiling hush), reweighting wolf-lie premise in final beam reignition without moralizing. Resonance in charged poise of endless chase. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in "threading his story through the cracks."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (hush as tactile entity) modulating rhythm under stress (short sentences at "A floorboard creaked"). Prose texture distinct in syntax (e.g., "a silence so thick it could smother a scream"). No dialogue; elisions purposeful, paid in climax reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (hush as noose/weight) without muddle, supporting lyric accumulation. Rhythm varies (groaning hinge to flickering beam). Minor overwrite in opening density doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wolf fable son chasing sentient "hush" in lighthouse-prison transforms tropes via hush's physicality and beam's reignition as truth-signal. Risky poetic compression feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
