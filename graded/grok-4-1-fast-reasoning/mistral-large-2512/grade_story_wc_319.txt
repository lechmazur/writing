<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied homesickness and earned shift from waiting to acceptance, but diagnostic label-speak in "to make friends with uncertainty" undermines mid-crisis authenticity without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final lines ("something had shifted... didn’t feel the need to wait"), cost legible in pendant's chill and foreclosed longing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden's mist and expanding paths constrain movement and mirror internal wound, charging final image where garden persists but Mara shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of homesick seeking tightens via guardian's book interaction, narrowing to renunciation of waiting with felt acceptance cost; agency in kneeling suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from pendant, book inscription ("I am homesick..."), and final reconfiguration, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ink/frost imagery; dialogue subtextual ("That’s not yours") advances stakes; rhythmic control modulates to lucid dream tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in book scene ("ink bleeding... blood from a cut") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian and dimensional homesickness transforms library trope; risk in foggy surrealism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
