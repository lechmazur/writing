<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority like "debt gnawed at her like a rat in the walls of her ribs" roots motivation; contradictory mournful elation earns closure acceptance. Ghost bride's passivity limits relational crucible, but doesn't undermine Liora's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whisper to bead vision, landing CR closure in "wound remained—lovingly venomous, forever open" with emotional cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early; flashback shard interleaves without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (metallic tang, frosted panes) filter through Liora's bias, constraining isolation; greenhouse/tree rustle charges final sigh/image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment via memory) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through bead trigger narrowing to knowing's cost; agency in accepting bead forecloses denial with felt sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loving betrayal emerges organically via bloodied hands vision to open-wound closure, reweighting premise without moralizing; bead reprise offers non-literal resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased toward magical decay; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in memory beat without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; figurative layering (mist, spirals) purposeful and pattern-taught, no muddle or loops dulling final bead-to-lips image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost debt in alchemical orchard transforms tropes via textured memory/bead logic; risk in lyric CR heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
