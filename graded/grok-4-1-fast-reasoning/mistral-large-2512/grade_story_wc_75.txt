<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in family loss propel her to bake despite doubt; dream with flour dust embodies contradiction between memory and action, earning her persistence, though change softens into affirmation without sharp renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of memory-images building to Charged Poise closure in tapestry-weaving and bees' return with felt cost of thawed history; shards taught early via opera glass motif, transitions legible, orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's damp mist and waterfall roar constrain choices (e.g., persistent echoes seep into hall) and charge final image; sensory details (wet moss, old paper) filtered through Liora's historical bias mirror internal thaw, with opera glass as micro-setting reweighting past at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rescue dying arts signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream-prompted baking that forces trade-off (expectation vs. "just bread"); bees' hum marks deepening with legible cost of waiting traditions, protagonist agency in kneading drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-seeds reviving through action emerges organically from bread, tapestry, bees; final image non-literally answers "why did we stop?" via reprise of glowing threads now moving, reweighting loss with resonant hope amid counter-reading of fragile refuge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (parchment/ink metaphors) modulates rhythm under rising hope; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (baker's silence, "shape it right") advances via implication; no head-hopping, diction biased to historical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm (e.g., "crust cracking like old parchment") propels via image-varied sentences; no loops or scaffolds, minor figurative density in opening fits accumulative pattern without muddling peak bee-hum beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bees carrying songs, opera glass revealing ghost-crafts transforms displacement tropes; risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes of thawing history, inevitable in hindsight via seeded motifs without retreat from premise.</comment>
