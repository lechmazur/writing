<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices under puzzle pressure reveal inventive traits effectively; realization of self-search feels earned via causal chain of clues. Mother's brief pressure fits scope without diluting Elias's arc. Epiphany line ("searching for his own all along") borders on direct but anchors in clipboard heft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chalk codes → juxtaposition → message decode → mother reveal as CR closure with legible emotional cost in "clipboard suddenly heavy." Single scene oriented early (arcade, Elias's role); no shards or disorientation. Persistent constraint of clues narrows to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn constrains choices (chalk transcription on floor) and charges final image with "gilded mirage" light spilling as honey. Sensory hierarchy (neon flicker, worn joystick) reflects nostalgic POV bias. Futuristic details (holograms) plausible without anachronism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode clues for sender) signaled early via PO box letter; causal tightening at message solve ("Meet me where...") narrows to mother reveal, forcing realization trade-off. Agency in inventive solving drives escalation; cost felt in chest-tightening familiarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of identity hidden in margins emerges organically from mail obsession, pseudonyms, and chalk codes, reweighted by final realization without moralizing. Subtext in looping script and sidewalk codes invites ambiguity on family loss. Closing image answers "truth hides" non-literally via self-search.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (nostalgic relic-noticing); voice modulates rhythmically from calm decoding to pulse-quickening reveal. Mother's dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("too clever for your own good"). Clean free indirect style throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("liquid honey") purposeful for tone but risks purple in dawn description. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia frame transforms pseudonym trope into personal puzzle reveal; chalk codes and arcade dawn offer fresh synthesis. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens emotional stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable detail: sidewalk chalk evokes childlike origins tying to mother.</comment>
