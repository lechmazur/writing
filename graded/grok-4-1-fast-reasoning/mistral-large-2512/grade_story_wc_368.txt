<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in donor heart restlessness; micro-choices like tracing wing reveal watchful traits under subtle pressure. Internal conflict emerges quietly in simultaneous watchfulness and need; earned realization at "his search was over" shows credible endurance. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more reflective than dramatically simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early observations to dawn shimmer CR closure; map reconfiguration ("symbols had begun to shimmer") makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of ended search. Orientation anchored immediately in tea house; one meaningful deepening via traveler's map aligning sun trails. Persistent constraint (light trails) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (sun patterns on rice paper, mist-damp cloak) filtered through dye master's priorities constrain observations and charge balcony final image. Tea house as micro-setting enables hovering watchfulness; purposeful economy mirrors internal shimmer without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding story magnetization) signaled early, tightens texturally via map/sun trails alignment forcing realization. One deepening at night talk/dawn image narrows options to acceptance; subtle agency in sustained tracking with felt cost of foreclosed search. Escalation coheres under lens without decisive protagonist act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of iridescent lives/stories emerges organically from wing/map particulars, subtext in "glow when light hits right"; final shimmer offers resonant reconfiguration reweighting morpho caution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual bias toward light fractures stable in single POV; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("dyes the sky") advances goal. Rhythmic modulation peaks in "iridescence flared, then dimmed"; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bamboo stilts submerged... heron" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (ink in water), no loops or artifacts. Propulsion aligns with lyric needs, zero overwriting in peak dawn beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-transplant dye master tracking stories via morpho iridescence in floating tea house transforms mystic trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens quiet stakes organically. Final shimmer feels inevitable from sun trails buildup.</comment>
