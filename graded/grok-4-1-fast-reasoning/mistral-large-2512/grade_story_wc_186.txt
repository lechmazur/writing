<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (visions tasting of "old rain"); motivation intensifies to compel departure with cost (leaving pavilion); contradictory solitude vs. quest earned through prism moment. Final choice reveals values hierarchy without safety-hedging. 9+ test passed: impulses act in prism-holding scene, closure earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prism find to sky-use flicker, tightening via deepened pavilion song; Charged Poise closure ("its song softer now, as if it knew he wouldn’t be back") lands on-page with legible opportunity cost. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity. 9+ test: cost in exact final pavilion image, constraint (stars/prism) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion glass/prism constrain choices (climb, hold to sky) and charge final image (humming softens); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alkali crust, rust scent); details tactile/evolving (wind-scraped panes to crunching boots). Recurrent light shards mirror internal shift purposefully. 9+ test passed: pavilion/prism charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove meaning via rekindling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to prism-induced flicker narrowing options (walk or stay); agency in holding prism forces crystallization with cost (abandoning post). One decisive deepening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (coincidences as meaning) emerges organically from prism, stars, beacon pulse; final walk reconfigures prior fragments non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (hush shard stilling wind to light fracture); invites ambiguity (is flicker real?). 9+ test: resonant answer in departure image reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (lyric bias to hums/light/shards); rhythmic modulation under rising intensity (short sentences at flicker: "His breath caught."); purposeful compression legible, voice as character (dry leaves laugh). No head-hopping; 9+ test: signature/rhythm excel under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion (sentences layer sense/action: "held the shard to the sky, turning it until the light fractured"); rhythm varies (long reflective to punchy climax); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (frozen tears to tiny suns). Zero scaffold; 9+ test: density/propulsion flawless, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognitive hush-prism in thistle-hope post-collapse solo quest transforms tropes organically; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes (pavilion farewell image inevitable in hindsight). Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
