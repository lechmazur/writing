<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to probe silence via precise observations and signing confrontation feels rooted and intensifies to a credible refusal; contradictory impulses emerge in enduring numbness for truth. Madame Veyra applies pressure through serene deflection. Minor abstraction in "frostbitten hope" reflection slightly dilutes embodiment at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build from bolt absence to discoloration trace to confrontation, culminating in CR closure where Elias reprices safety's cost by refusing forgetting ("the question remained"). One tightening via deliberate removal narrows to truth pursuit. Orientation anchored early in fortress routine; cost legible in final refusal image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "air smelled of old parchment and rust" and "rusted streak" filter through Elias's precision bias, constraining path up staircase to confrontation. Snow muffles externally, amplifying internal silence. Fortress/discoloration charges final realization moment without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety's silencing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bolt removal forcing confrontation; agency in signing accusation and refusal forecloses acceptance with felt endurance cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as safety's price emerges organically from choir accident echoes, bolt erasure, and Veyra's "forgetting"; final sheet music placement offers resonant CR without statement. Subtext in off-key humming and blank staff invites ambiguity on necessary silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third POV stable with Elias's perceptual signature (noticing imperfections others miss); voice modulates rhythmically from metronomic precision to charged signing. Dialogue subtextual—Veyra's serenity vs. Elias's signs pursues goals indirectly. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short, punchy sentences in confrontation; density high as images advance stakes (e.g., "empty hole where it had been"). Minor overwrought openings like "towers clawing at the twilight" but purposeful for tone; no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muted bellhop tracing fortress secrets transforms silence trope via nerve regen backstory and choir accident; discoloration bolt as question feels inevitable. Risks quiet CR ending that heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
