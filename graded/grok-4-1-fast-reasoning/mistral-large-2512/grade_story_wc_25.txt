<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's skills in maps and walks root motivation and compel the challenge; embodied stress ("teeth ache") and micro-choice to step out reveal character under pressure. Woman's arrival applies immediate relational crucible with status shift via her knowing response. Minor slip: her traits told via summary rather than shown in extended interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of coin/map/key/walks tightens to spiral recognition and key exchange as Charged Poise RR, with storm-pause cost legible in "the storm seemed to hold its breath." Orientation anchors early (Port Veyra, Elias's role). Single continuous scene fits scope; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain path via "counting paces" and wind pitch; geomagnetic storm charges final image, narrowing perception to halos and hum. Sensory hierarchy (crunching frost, humming metal) filters through Elias's expertise. Body/tool (gloves, key) as micro-setting enables spotting her spiral walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock labyrinth's whisper proof) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via map-following to walk-identification reversal, narrowing solo search to duo alliance with key-handover cost. Agency in "Prove it" forces her stance crystallization. Pressure coheres under Textural lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Whispers-over-shouts emerges organically via wind/labyrinth physics and final exchange reweighting isolation to alliance. Subtext in "Shouts are for the desperate" layers moral calculus without statement. Final grins answer premise with resonant ambiguity: labyrinth "waiting" carries conceptual cost of commitment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual bias (walk-reading, map scars); diction textured ("drunkards," "choir of the lost") modulates rhythm under storm stress. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-heavy ("Prove it"), advances to closure. No head-hopping; distance tightens at exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/character work (e.g., "static in his gloves making the hair... stand straight"). Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences in climax; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrite: stacked metaphors ("fist," "choir," "drunkards") in opener slightly muddy but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Identifying walks" as lock synthesizes fresh premise from port realism; spiral pattern turn feels inevitable from map/whispers buildup. Bold risk: storm-physics enable whisper rules without gimmick. Transformation elevates shipping maze beyond trope.</comment>
