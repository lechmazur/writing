<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between foolish hope and hollowness shown in soil-pressing ritual; micro-choices like unspooling thread reveal values under pressure. Embodied emotion (hollowed out) particular and consistent. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract pivotal endurance without full deduction as closure earns it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from theft reflection to garden ritual, culminating in CR closure ("let them swallow her whole") with legible cost of self-loss. Orientation anchored early (Lena in garden post-ships). Single scene with BRR-compliant reflection; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed garden and thread as micro-setting constrain ritual choice and charge final image (roots binding kingdom). Sensory selectivity (damp earth, wind gust) mirrors grief via POV bias. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map grief/healing) signaled early, deepens texturally through thread ritual narrowing to endurance with cost (hollowing, shadows). Agency in pressing soil forecloses tidy resolution. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of projecting presence into absence emerges organically from obits, theft, ritual; final image reconfigures as CR without moral ("foolish hope... all she had"). Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (tracing paths, thread hum); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture to charged poise. No head-hopping or withholding; voice biased to weaver's eye.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short gust sentence to long imagining); weaving metaphors consistent without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obits-for-living + stolen thread ritual transforms grief trope into geographic healing map. Risky lyric closure feels inevitable; irreplaceable particulars heighten resonance.</comment>
