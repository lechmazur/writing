<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied motivation via serum burn and drumming compulsion compels escape; snapping restraints reveals quietly rebellious trait with cost of serum overload. Interiority concrete without epiphanies. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds drumming density to Charged Poise closure; "He wasn’t just Elias anymore. He was her" reconfigures self with entanglement cost. Orientation anchored by lab table ~50 words in; shards taught early, transitions legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden sculptures constrain perch and charge final drumming image; sensory narrowing (ozone, ripples) mirrors crisis urgency via POV bias. Lagoon shimmers integrate with action. No white-room; spatial shifts coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to reunite via memories tightens accumulatively through drumming intensification to universe inhale; agency in escape/perch forecloses normalcy with self-merge cost. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Entanglement theme emerges via drumming/lagoon images shifting loss to shared aliveness; final merge reweights without moral. Subtext in whispers implies dream's cost. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose mirrors drumming signature; serum-altered perception selective/embodied consistently. Stable close-third POV; no leakage. Voice modulates intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful drumming repetition avoids loops; syntax varies for propulsion. Metaphors coherent (liquid starlight/starlight ripples). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drumming-memory serum synthesis fresh on loss trope; universe-breath frame risks mythic tone but heightens stakes organically. Perch reprise inevitable from particulars.</comment>
