<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "should have run. But he didn’t," compelling the offering; minor label-only flaw in "religiously skeptical" lacks early tradeoff cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density to Charged Poise closure in "The hush that followed was louder than any confession," with legible conceptual cost of truth's weight; orientation anchors early, structure single-scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel's "cold that seeped into your bones" constrains advance and charges final hush; sensory selection (wet concrete, clanking) purposeful and POV-biased to recklessness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reckless truth-seeking tightens via figure encounter and agency in wheel-offer, foreclosing flight with felt cost in exhale; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of lingering labor/memory emerges organically from ghost shift figure and valve reprise, resonant hush reweights skepticism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in sensory biases ("flashlight cutting through the dust like a knife through stale bread") stable under single POV; rhythmic modulation supports drowsy-to-charged pressure.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("boots crunched on broken glass"); minor "the kind of" repetition purposeful for texture, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost shift workers as faceless laborers transforms haunted mill trope through labor-memory synthesis; valve offering inflects fresh inevitability.</comment>
