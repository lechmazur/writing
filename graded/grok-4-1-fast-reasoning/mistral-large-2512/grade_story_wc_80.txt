<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's stoically sensitive trait enables endurance in feeling despair ("chest tightened") yet acting firmly, earning his final keeper-of-echoes reconfiguration with visible cost (inkwell emptied). Micro-choices like writing responses reveal values under pressure. Minor label-speak ("stoically sensitive nature both a curse and a gift") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note discoveries build density, tightening to Charged Poise closure where empty inkwell and "pavilion breathed... wasn’t alone" reconfigures absence with felt cost (emotional weight, immersion). Orientation anchored early ("Elias Veyne, firm shore surveyor... water’s edge"). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (water to knees forces progression; foundation crevices supply notes). Inkwell as recurring micro-setting charges final image ("clutched the empty inkwell"). Sensory details selective/POV-biased ("fingers along the mortar, feeling for hollows").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wrest meaning from ruins) signaled early, deepens accumulatively per lens via deepening notes ("love was enough. But the river always wins"), narrowing to renunciation/endurance with cost (ink depleted, water immersion). Final tightening forces stance crystallization. Protagonist agency clear in responses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence/saving past emerges organically via notes/images, reweighted non-literally in closure ("pavilion breathed... wasn’t alone"). Complexity lingers without morals; final image answers "what if the past is the only thing worth saving?" Purposeful ambiguity in river's "win."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("ink... absorbed the weight of every word"; biased notice of mortar hollows). Lyrical rhythm modulates with immersion ("water seeping into his boots"). No dialogue or head-hopping; compression purposeful/lyric-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion aligns with scene (short sentences in discoveries accelerate). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; metaphors consistent ("sigh held too long"). Minor overwriting in opening descriptors ("hushed blaze of things that refused to burn out") doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surveyor responding to ancestors' notes in submerged ruins transforms ruin-exploration trope via inkwell chain. Quiet rebellion ending risks bold lyric poise, heightening stakes organically. No derivative echoes; specific details (drawbridge gears) ground ingenuity.</comment>
