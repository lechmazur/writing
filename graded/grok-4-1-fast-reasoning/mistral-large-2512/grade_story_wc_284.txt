<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via scar-tracing and pillbox hesitation reveals contradictory impulses (prudently daring vs. bold choice); final pocketing of file earns change from erasure to endurance with embodied cost in scars, though one diagnostic line ("I was wrong") borders unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building images (mist, codes, key) to Conceptual Repricing closure: pocketing file reconfigures "fixing" as carrying forward; legible cost in "scars didn’t ache" after entering room; orientation anchored in para 1; door reveal pays off snow codes pattern without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and snow codes constrain choices (lead to bluff moment, reveal door); recurring mist charges final image (lifts as scars ease); sensory hierarchy (cold pillbox, breath hush) POV-filtered; purposeful selection mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix broken self/past) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pillbox-to-key-to-file; protagonist agency in inserting key and pocketing forecloses forgetting path; cost unmistakable in carried burden and scars' release charging end image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (brokenness as light-through-cracks) emerges organically from scar, codes apology, file confession; final image ("scars didn’t ache... carried forward") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (scars/mist/tilt as biased notices); rhythmic modulation builds hush to release; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm/syntax; minor simile density ("mist like smoke... valley like a wound") coherent for atmosphere but borders overwrite in opening para without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spy-redemption tropes transformed via snow codes and pillbox-key logic; fresh synthesis of ciphered past and spring thaw feels inevitable; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens resonance.</comment>
