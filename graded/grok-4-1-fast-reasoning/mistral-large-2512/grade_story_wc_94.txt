<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and poet-specific lens on scars compel endurance to carry the unread map; embodied warmth of timer grounds emotion. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene before closure laugh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds pattern density to CR closure: scars as deliberate map reconfigures premise, cost legible in "some maps were never meant to be read, only carried." Lightning revelation tightens one decisive cadence shift; orientation anchored in para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and lightning flash constrain revelation choice and charge final star image. Sensory hierarchy (violet/gold streaks narrowing to unblinking star) reflects Elias's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decipher photo escalates accumulatively via timer beeps and storm intensification, forcing internal crystallization. Visible cost in renouncing full reading for carrying forecloses interpretive path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars as habitable exile maps emerges organically from photo pattern and final pocket image, offering non-literal answer to envelope question without moralizing. Resonant reweighting lingers via carried heartbeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (scars as "moonlit rivers"); rhythmic modulation peaks in revelation without head-hopping. Voice holds lyric compression coherently to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, but figurative overload in revelation beat ("deliberate as a map’s legend: a river here, a mountain range there") risks coherence under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet's vigil with scars-as-map transforms scar trope into conceptual cartography; risk-taking lyric frame heightens stakes inevitably to carried-map CR.</comment>
