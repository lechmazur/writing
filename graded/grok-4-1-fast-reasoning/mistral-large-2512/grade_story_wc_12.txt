<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory fear/understanding impulses act in layering choices, earning the final invitation to possession; embodied shiver, burning violet, and micro-choices like scraping the palette reveal flaws under pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound layers densify to drone/whisper/scrape/heartbeat, culminating in resonant chord and violet-spread CR with conceptual cost of revealed possession; orientation anchored early, one tightening at anchor's groan pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palette and loop pedal as micro-settings constrain ritual choices and charge final staining image; dimensional anchor's hum/thrum/groan mirrors internal fraying-to-reveal, with sensory hierarchy (sound-dominant) filtered through priest's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ritual illumination before possession) signaled early, textural escalation via layer density forces stance shift to invitation; cost unmistakable in burning/spreading violet foreclosing fear-path, driven by priest's additive choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-canvas/revealed truths emerges organically from sound layers and "stillness wasn’t unraveled. It was revealed," reweighting premise without moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer tying ritual to possession invitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in sound-texture (hum/drone/scrape); rhythmic modulation builds to chord cadence, prose syntax echoing layered loops without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "loop pedal clicking to life" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives like "fraying...shroud" cohere without muddle in peak chord beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of loop-pedal ritual/possession in dimensional anchor transforms priest trope via violet/sound layers; bold accumulative risk heightens stakes, final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
