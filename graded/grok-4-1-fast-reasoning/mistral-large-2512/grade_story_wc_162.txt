<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in tracing grain ("fingers following the whorls") reveals obsessive flaw balancing competence with futile search; contradictory impulses (admiration turning to loss) earn final renunciation. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("featherly determined") feels label-like without deeper tradeoff. Epiphany at "He understood, then" ties to prior causality without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in wood/prism images to CR closure ("the necessary distances... became visible"); cost legible in final turning away with logbook weight as persistent constraint. Orientation anchored early (Elias on terrace by para 1). Single deepening via prism vision-then-gone pays off without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (visual fractures, tactile warm spirals, auditory creak) filters through Elias's grain-obsessed POV, constraining choices (tracing benches, picking prism). Recurring prism charges final image, mirroring internal distortion. Evolving details (tilting panels, spinning gust) integrate causally without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via clues) signaled early, tightens texturally through deepening realizations narrowing to renunciation; agency in endurance forecloses obsessive path with emotional cost felt in "turned away." Prism beat reversal reweights knowledge under lens. No abstract stakes—visceral in vanished footprints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from particulars (doorways, wood whorls, terrace edge), reweighted in CR ending image without moralizing. Final line resonates non-literally, embracing ambiguity of "world bent" with oblique cost. Subtext in image shifts (prism vision of Mira) avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light/wood thresholds) and rhythmic modulation (lyric hush to charged poise). Voice texture distinct in syntax ("sky split by fractured light"), certain where Elias knows, eliding only to build resonance. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rainbows... broken promises" advances atmosphere/mood); rhythm varies purposefully, read-aloud flows. Minor overwrite in repetitive "fractured" motifs purposeful but borders loop in mid-section. Zero scaffold; strong verbs propel to crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wood-grain analysis, prism thresholds, butterfly-effect splintering transforms lost-child trope into lyric CR on parallel escapes. Risky poetic compression feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable terrace logic. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
