<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Painter's motivation to unearth memory via painting and dreams drives consistent micro-choices like following trails; embodied reactions (brooch warms wrist, chest tightens) reveal contradiction between remembering and forgetting. Final hand-taking earns closure via prior buildup. Woman's opaque motives feel underpressured despite wry delivery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (dreams, rain trails, amber walls) builds to cave encounter and Charged Poise closure ("Some convergences... by being pulled under"), with legible cost in tide swallowing paths and brooch burning. Two-shard structure (island to cave) transitions cleanly; orientation anchored early via tidal island and Sleepless moniker. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal island and cave constrain choices (rain trails lead, tide erases paths); amber resin walls charge final image as memory-trap. Sensory details (slick salt, wet stone, copper smell) filter through painter's desperate perception, evolving with rain halting and tide rising. Micro-setting (brooch as body-anchor) integrates purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearthing lost stories/memory) signaled early via dreams/brooch, tightens accumulatively to cave exchange narrowing options (forget vs. remember). Agency in following trails and taking hand forecloses forgetting with felt cost (burning brooch, pulled under). Pressure coheres under Textural lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of drowned stories resurfacing emerges via amber motifs shifting from dream to cave-trap to burning convergence, reweighting painter's "paint to remember/forget" without statement. Final image answers "threshing meaning" non-literally through exchange cost. Subtext in wry dialogue and hesitation invites ambiguity on burial vs. submersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (oil on water, sluiced paths) biases toward tactile/visceral awe; dialogue natural/subtextual ("A key. Or a lock") advances goals with wry distinction. Stable single-POV distance modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences in cave). No head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early pays in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images ("jagged spit of rock and driftwood"); rhythm varies (long atmospheric opens to terse dialogue/closure). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language ("rain carried memory") pattern-taught, purposeful without overwriting in peak cave beat. Clean mechanics enhance ear-test propulsion.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-water wars tidal isolation, amber-preserved memory, and rain-guided convergence transforms dream-trope into textured exchange. Risky haggard-lyric tone heightens stakes via subtle world rules (drowned stories). Final "pulled under" feels inevitable from island logic, no derivative hedging.</comment>
