<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's ambition and olfactory sensitivity root clear motivation that intensifies via warnings, with embodied scents and micro-choices like unwrapping the seed; internal conflict emerges in unflinching response to Nara. Grandmother's journal earns the shift to patience without full contradiction in scene. Epiphany borders unearned via external note, but prior obsession justifies endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory details and observations build density to Nara's arrival (tightening) and CR closure ("Serenity wasn’t in the destination—it was in the tending"), reweighting stake with conceptual cost of delayed bloom. Single scene, anchored early, one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (scents, swaying bridges, moss-lined balcony) filters through Mira's priorities, mirroring internal sway; village hum pressures reflective stasis. Balcony edge constrains her crouched focus, charging final journal-close image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness corpse flower for serenity) signaled early, deepens via Nara/journal to foreclose rushed bloom; lens-consistent cadence shift reweights with patience cost. Agency in tracing doodles and laughing response crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-in-motion emerges organically from seed tending, warnings, and grandmother's note ("The stillness is not in the bloom, but in the waiting"), offering resonant CR without statement. Final image recharges particulars non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias via scents; dialogue natural with subtext ("I’m playing with life") advances pressure. Rhythm modulates to quiet laugh at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short journal beats, longer village hum); density high, metaphors purposeful (drowsy cat) without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening sensory run, but propels accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower peril in swaying treetops with olfactory wisdom-chase transforms tropes; family doodles inflect realization organically.</comment>
