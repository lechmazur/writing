<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's persistence compels singing despite silence trait, earning carousel activation; contradictory impulses act in song falter then laugh, with transformation cost in roar replacing hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as halo glow, chimes, mist density culminate in RR closure of halo placement spinning carousel; cost legible in "world had answered," reweighting isolation into blur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Train floorboards yield halo constraining discovery, sawdust/carousel socket charges final spin; sensory hierarchy (chimes over wind) filters through carpenter's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Song tightens stake from silence to summoning under textural lens, halo placement foreclosing isolation with carousel trade-off; cost felt in "blurred into a streak of color."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final spin offers non-literal answer to silence-as-possibility, reweighting hush to roar via halo image without moral; emerges organically from persistence particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (silence as canvas, wood traces) biases noticing; rhythm crescendos from hum to "roar of a crowd," stable close-POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels train shudder beat with varied syntax; no loops, coherent metaphors (mist "curling like a living thing") enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Halo as tarnished divine tear summoning carousel transforms circus trope originally; risk in lyric hush-to-roar pays off in charged poise.</comment>
