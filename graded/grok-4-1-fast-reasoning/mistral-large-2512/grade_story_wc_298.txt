<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in Liora's hesitation over the memory ("phantom weight of his fingers"), embodied in fists curling despite "fiercely gentle hands"; reckless idealism compels bargain with visible cost in soul-widening. Final renunciation earned by prior sigil-carving buildup. Minor label-speak ("Patchwork Girl") feels told briefly but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of orchard imagery and bargain pressure builds to Charged Poise closure when card crumbles and she walks "lighter, her soul heavier," with legible conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early ("catacomb orchard... Liora crouched"). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully—"roots threading through ribs and skulls" mirrors internal patching, constraining bargain via orchard's ledger logic; sensory hierarchy (wet earth, rot clinging throat) narrows with rustle tension. Final roots trembling recharge prior bone imagery, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewrite brother's entry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stranger's memory demand, forcing trade-off renunciation with on-page cost ("hole... would widen"). Protagonist agency in "Take it" crystallizes stance under Textural lens. No reversal overload needed; pressure coheres to ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bartered lives emerges organically from seed/memory exchange, reweighting "trammel fate" premise in final image without moralizing. Soul-patching motif shifts from desperate mending to endured carrying, inviting ambiguity on cracks' value. Resonant non-literal answer: some holes "could only be carried."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (bark whispers, bones' hollows); single POV stable, no head-hopping. Dialogue subtext-rich ("A memory... that keeps you awake"), goal-driven, idiom-distinct (stranger's "dry leaves skittering"). Rhythmic modulation peaks crisply at "Take it."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern ("scorched petals," "moth wings"); rhythm varies, propels via short sentences in climax ("She opened her palm. The burned tarot card crumbled to dust."). Minor metaphor density in opening risks overwrite but teaches lyric texture early without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard and bartered seed premise synthesize fresh angle on fate-bargains, transformed via marrow-drinking roots and memory price; risk-taking in dusky lyricism heightens stakes organically. Final "roots trembled, as if remembering" feels inevitable, recharging particulars without gimmick.</comment>
