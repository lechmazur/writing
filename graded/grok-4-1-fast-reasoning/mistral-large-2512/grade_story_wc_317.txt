<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to safeguard innovation earned through redesigning escape room puzzle as life-cycle mirror; contradictory impulses subtle in risk vs. dormancy choice at "Players would have to choose"; minor slip in abrupt "pieces clicked" backstory reveal without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via delivery density building to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in courier's "They’re coming" plunging room to darkness with petal unfolding; orientation anchored early in brook/escape room, one tightening via threat note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring brook murmur constrains planting choice and charges final image as "steady rhythm in the storm-born silence"; selective sensory hierarchy (murmurs, lantern flicker) reflects receptive POV; spatial choreography coherent across indoor/outdoor shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant protection stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively through warning notes/photo to stance crystallization; agency in planting/redesigning forecloses dormancy with theft cost visible in final readiness; one deepening via photo's childhood link suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corpse flower shifts from macabre decay to "fragile and fierce" innovation, reweighting stillness/growth theme in final petal unfold without moralizing; emergent from puzzle integration and threat; resonant ambiguity in "her fight" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mystery-receptive noticing ("challenge wrapped in silence"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates tension, as in "wet, tearing noise"; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in courier whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "silence" recurrence propelling accumulative rhythm; varied syntax accelerates to closure; minor template slip in repeated "box arrived" but causality intact, no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower lore with escape room orthogonality transforms mystery trope into innovation safeguard; risk in macabre bloom as reckoning heightens stakes organically; no close famous echoes.</comment>
