<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's gift noticing "magic in mundane things" roots clear motivation and irony, with blind spot compelling the climactic failure to foresee danger. Pilgrim applies immediate pressure, her sharp smile and vial clinks distinguishing her. Weak agency limits micro-choices until final lunge, but endurance of isolation earns closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pilgrim's arrival therefore pearl activation therefore DC at "pearl cracked... shadows recoiled, then surged." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via dream foreshadows shift. Minor shard transition legible, closure cost legible in "cave screamed" and Elias alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Musical crystals and "bright darkness" constrain choices, pulsing with shadows to charge final image of mourning song. Sensory hierarchy (hum to scream) filters via Elias's gift; spatial choreography coherent to heart stalactite. Cave evolves causally, mirroring hunger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear magic) tightens via pearl press, narrowing to catastrophe with agency in lunge. Escalation causal under lens, cost visible in pilgrim swallowed and cave's softened song. Passivity dilutes pressure slightly pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unseen forces' hunger emerges via pearl backfire, resonant CR in final line "they were watching" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in pilgrim's "everywhere" ambition vs. cost invites ambiguity. Particulars like shadows gaining teeth avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd Elias POV with perceptual signature in glimpsed magic; dialogue subtextual ("Making the unseen seen"). Rhythm modulates to climax urgency; no head-hopping, diction fits sensitive observer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("shadows grew teeth"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in cave descriptions purposeful for texture, not obscuring "pearl cracked" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pearl-as-lens transforms cave trope into hungry force via shadows; fresh synthesis of clairvoyance irony and magnification hubris feels organic. Risk in abstract forces gaining agency heightens stakes to closure.</comment>
