<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in coin touch and father backstory compel the final hand-squeeze choice with girl; contradictory fire-healing impulse acts in scene via dialogue. Girl as secondary pressure forces relational micro-choice. Minor reflection summary slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo reflection to girl interaction, cadence shifts to charged poise in final walk/teaching with felt cost of sharing scars publicly. Orientation anchored early in lagoon/beach. Closure reconfigures solo healing into communal promise—"she had stayed to teach others how to hear the song"—with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand as micro-setting handled tactilely (boots sinking, sifting, whispering), constraining reflection and charging final image; obsidian lagoon mirrors internal resilience purposefully. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fire scars to volcanic scars). Volcanic idiom consistent, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake ("prove scars can sing") signaled early, tightens accumulatively via girl's arrival/curiosity forcing stance crystallization in invitation to walk/teach. One deepening forecloses solitary path with relational cost. Agency in micro-choices (sift sand, explain coin) drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing-from-scars emerges organically via sand/coin/lagoon images shifting from personal endurance to shared compassion; final "lagoon held them all—past, present, and promise" offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in girl's nod implies complexity. No tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with poetic perceptual signature (fire-scar bias in noticing sand/water); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Fire isn’t the only thing that burns"), advances goal with distinct child idiom. Rhythm modulates from meditative to poised; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm suits lyric texture; purposeful repetition ("scars could sing," black sand) accumulates without loops dulling propulsion. Minor paraphrase in healing motifs and "kelp-drift" (oceanic oddity on volcanic beach) slightly jars register. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-daughter firefighter at volcanic lagoon transforms trauma trope via tactile sand/coin healing; risk in lyric reflection over plot heightens thematic stakes organically. No template echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
