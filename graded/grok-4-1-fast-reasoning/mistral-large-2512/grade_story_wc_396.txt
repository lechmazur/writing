<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's courage as anomaly flares credibly in micro-choices like pressing the fragment to mirrors despite uncertainty, earning the climax hurl; interiority concrete via shadows writhing and pulse steadying under threat. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously, limiting to strong but not exceptional. Backstory anchors tilt present via seer's whisper cueing fragment use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mirror glimpses because fragment pressing therefore reveal child/teeth/path, narrowing to village run and hurl DC. Orientation anchors Elias/orchard/ice early (~50 words). Closure on-page with legible cost in beast's convulsion and Elias's receding shadows/chest weight lifting; persistent crystal constraint shapes tactics to finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard branches form corridor via mirror, constraining path choice; ice groans pressure run to village. Sensory selective: frost-laced/salt-old paper/breath curling reflect urgency. Mirrors as micro-setting warp reflections to charge glimpses, mirroring internal bridge light/dark without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute to save village from ice) signaled via seer, tightens causally through mirror revelations foreclosing options to direct confrontation. Agency in hurling fragment amid grinding floes; cost felt in unflinching stand as beast breaches. No micro-turn excess; one decisive escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Empathy-to-action theme emerges via child fear driving village run, child's final "reconstituted the light" resonating non-literally with beam image reweighting courage premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "shattered promise" lingers cost. Particulars like fragment/mirrors avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias: intuition filters mirrors/ice urgently. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "time seemed to thicken like molasses," modulating rhythm to pressure; whispers carry subtext without exposition. No head-hopping; diction matches shadow-laced lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied openings/sentence lengths accelerating to "ice screamed"; density high with lines doubling image/action. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., "skeletal fingers"/"molasses") in opening but thins at peak; no loops touch closure. "Calmly intuitive" repeat minor, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vintage mirrors/orchard above floes transform oracle trope, ice sinew beast vulnerable to hurled crystal defying expectation. Risk in poetic compression pays via causal glimpses; no template echoes, premise commits to intuition rules.</comment>
