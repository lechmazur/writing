<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "fingers tracing the vein of a moth wing," rooting esoteric realist traits in tactile actions; motivation to honor histories compels signal-building with embodied warmth at arrivals. Minor unearned epiphany in "proof of what she had always suspected" dilutes contradiction before monarchs lift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of signals and monarch arrivals tightening to Charged Poise closure in "the signal had been sent. And that was enough," with legible cost of impermanence; single-scene coherence, early orientation anchors Liora in grotto by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Verdant grotto's "moss-draped walls breathing in the mist" vividly constrains via "pull[ing] at her" and enables monarch pause, charging final packing image; sensory hierarchy filters through Liora's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor interrupted histories escalates accumulatively from first signal to surprise arrivals and lattice, narrowing to departure's felt cost; agency in second build tests persistence vs. transience under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked persistence emerges organically from signals and departures, reweighted non-literally in final "space between the beats of a heart"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in transients' bloom/fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to ephemera ("shadow lingered after the object"); rhythmic modulation builds to quiet intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, e.g., short closure sentences breathe cadence shift; minor overwriting density in opening metaphors slightly muddles without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly migration as signals of impermanence transforms tropes via "loose knot" that unravels; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitably to CR.</comment>
