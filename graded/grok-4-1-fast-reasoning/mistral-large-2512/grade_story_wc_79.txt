<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses like curiosity versus fear embodied in chiseling the groaning shell despite the pattern languages' whisper. Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the fracture and fleeing, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost in her inverted understanding. Final renunciation of her lifelong study feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal linkages hold tightly: crack discovery because prior mapping, chisel therefore tunnel entry, cavern reveal therefore flight and ship decision. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in the final image of boarding the ship, reweighting watchers and cracks with undeniable knowledge cost ("They were not watching the city. They were watching the cracks."). Orientation anchored early; single-shard scope with one tightening fits defaults, lens Causal dominant at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting specifics like grooved shells, fused bone towers, and slick tunnel walls constrain choices (crack as door, shell groans) and charge the final docks image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's cartographer bias toward patterns amid narrowing crisis perception. Turtle carapace as micro-setting mirrors internal shift, tactile and lived-in without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers via cracks/expedition) signaled early, tightens causally in cavern reversal that changes knowledge/options with agency-driven entry. Cost legible in trembling realization and burning lungs flight, foreclosing safe mapping. Escalation coherent under Causal lens, one decisive deepening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent warnings and guarded cracks emerges organically from pattern whispers and expedition's hollow watch, reweighted in final realization without statement. Subtext in watchers' stillness and Mira's chisel choice invites ambiguity on curiosity's price. Closing image offers non-literal answer to "what they guarded," charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in spiral/pattern focus; psychic distance modulates from calm mapping to stressed flight. Prose texture distinct in rhythmic syntax matching intensity, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice confident yet biased, inference as inference (e.g., "pattern languages whispered").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm propels from quiet chisel taps to sprinting clatter. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Closure image crisp, zero artifacts touching peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city and pattern-guarded cracks synthesize fresh premise, transforming lost-expedition trope via watchers' inversion. Bold world logic commits fully, with cavern turn inevitable from established mapping drive. Risk in quiet dread tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
