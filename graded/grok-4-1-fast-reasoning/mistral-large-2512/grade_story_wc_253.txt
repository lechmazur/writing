<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via tremors and wet face upon waking; contradictory impulses in ritual narration vs. deepening void doubt earn endurance at closure. Mask forgotten to remove reveals blank performer trait without safety-hedging. Solo POV limits relational crucible but micro-choices under grief pressure compel higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of rituals (tea narration evening to morning) builds to Charged Poise RR closure ("clung to it" amid crumbling flowers/void), with legible conceptual cost in silence unbearable. Orientation anchored early (farmhouse/Elias/turbines). Dream shard transition legible, one tightening via heavier words suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines as recurring "mechanical mourners" constrain isolation, charge final image; tea burns tongue embodies grief. Sensory selective (groan like dying breath, brittle petals). Micro-setting (bouquet/stick) mirrors internal void via action. 9+ gate met without slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief vs. void) signaled early, escalates via textural cadence shift (playful dream voice to "heavier than they should" narration), forcing endurance agency. Cost felt in "digging deeper" reweighting under lens. One tightening forecloses lightness path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grief rebellion vs. mandate emerges organically from ritual particulars; final whittling-to-nothing image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in narration lightness attempt charges ambiguity. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: flat, mechanical narration of mundane mirrors blank mask. Rhythmic control modulates (exaggerated care to heavier words) under grief stress. Voice texture distinct, purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "blades carving the dusk into strips" advances atmosphere/plot). Zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short peak sentences). Figuratives purposeful/coherent, no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh dystopic angle: happiness mandate + turbines harvesting void transforms grief trope. Quiet stasis ending risks bold, inevitable via ritual accumulation. No derivative echoes; specifics (whittled bird/tree/nothing) personalize.</comment>
