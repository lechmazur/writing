<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lumen's contradictory impulses—molting vs. craving permanence—embody in tracing the tin and sorting books under pressure, earning the closure renunciation of vagrancy when he hands Neruda to Elias.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as key-cued backstory interleaves with present sorting, tightening via Elias's arrival ("Took you long enough") into Charged Poise closure: "The resistance had begun," with identity cost legible.</comment>
