<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via tapping tic and trembling hands particularizes persistence; final resolve earned through mounting discoveries without tidy epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses at peak (hitched breath but no pull-back hesitation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density building to CR closure: answering knock reconfigures hidden watcher, cost legible in "periodic eternity" and final image of remembered paths amid fading corals. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via pattern of deletions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's hum, salt-paper air, loose panel constrain choices and charge discovery; sensory narrowing under unease (echoing boots, blinking monitors) mirrors dissolving dream path. Recurring sea laps against glass evolve to heartbeat rhythm, filtering through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover disappearing paths) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to agency in tapping/knock; cost felt in isolation's stretch and conceptual endurance of truth amid bleaching. Tightening forecloses ignorance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths emerges organically from torn pages and rhythm-knock, reweighting erasure vs. memory without moralizing; final image answers "dissolving paths" non-literally with charged poise of contact. Subtext in dream/fragments invites ambiguity on watcher's intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (rhythm-obsessed noticing) stable, syntax modulates unease to resolve; purposeful compression in shards taught early, paid off in knock. No head-hopping, diction biased to marine/data drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tapped out the rhythm... answering knock" advances three layers); rhythm varies, no loops though "rhythm" recurs purposefully. Minor scaffold in "three days assembling fragments" but strategic compression boosts propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-mystery with data-erasure conspiracy and rhythmic code-breaker; risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes via unseen watcher, inevitable in hindsight from pattern gaps. Transformation of bleaching trope through hidden agency.</comment>
