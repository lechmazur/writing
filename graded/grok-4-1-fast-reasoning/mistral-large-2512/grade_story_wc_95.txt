<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanical arm whirs concretely under stress, embodying diplomatic fierceness; contradictory impulses in stalling vs. admiring force micro-choices like card reveal. Final extension of card earns relational reconfiguration with Isolde's lingering fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of question-parries and light patterns culminating in Charged Poise: Isolde's exhale/surrender ("Fine") reconfigures duel to journey, cost legible in foreclosed opposition and "shadow stretching long."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial's coded angles and needle perforations constrain cipher readings, directing choices; glass amplifies brook from soothing to roaring countdown, charging final alignment image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overture amid duel) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cipher alignment narrowing "cheating" accusation to collaborative turn; agency in card extension forces her stance crystallization with exhale cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of questions-as-journeys emerges via light mappings and parries, not statement; final card alignment offers resonant answer to "where does this lead?" reweighting duels without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third on Elias with perceptual bias to gears/light/shadows; dialogue distinct—Elias cartographic, Isolde direct—with subtext in parries advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy exchanges amid descriptive swells; brook murmur recurs purposefully for textural escalation, but minor stacked modifiers ("jagged patterns...constellation") slightly blur peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious needle-card cipher transforms question-duel into mapped journey; risk of abstract philosophizing grounded in tactile alignments feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
