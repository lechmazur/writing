<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied consistency in habits like tracing spines or ear to obsidian, with motivation to witness clearly rooting endurance; subtle contradiction emerges in the new book's intrusion but resolves too passively without a micro-choice foreclosing a path with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of observations building to new book discovery and final wonder as Charged Poise RR, with legible cost in the passing thought reconfiguring self-stasis; orientation anchors early (library/catacombs by para 2), one tightening via pristine book suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and origami swan recur to constrain perception of malleable reality and charge final image; sensory details (gnarled fingers on spines, river lapping) filter through POV priorities, mirroring internal regeneration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of judgment-free witnessing signaled early tightens accumulatively via new book's shifting words, forcing endurance; cost felt in dissolution and foreclosed self-unfolding, but pressure remains internal/textural without agency-driven reversal narrowing options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Regenerative silence emerges organically from particulars like crumbling books and river's whisper, reweighted in final origami tracing without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure via passed wonder embraces ambiguity over tidy insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (reality gripped loosely, silence as healing) modulates rhythm with intensity, stable single POV; purposeful compression of backstory shards anchors to present cues like swan, maintaining diction coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (short final sentences propel closure); minor paraphrase loops on "silence" purposeful under textural lens, no artifacts dulling final image, though occasional elevated diction borders register drift in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic keeper with origami folds as cryptic anchor transforms vignette tropes; risk in nonlinear library drifts heightens textural stakes, inevitable in hindsight via swan's reprise.</comment>
