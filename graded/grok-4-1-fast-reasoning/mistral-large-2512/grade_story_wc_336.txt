<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels with concrete interiority and embodied emotion (heart swelled, hands trembling with weight), earning the final endurance via prior micro-choices like singing despite tremble; contradictory impulses in coaxing life from relic seed compel the peak stance without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from seed pulse to bud's swirl, with on-page Charged Poise closure (Maren sits back trembling, orchard lives) reconfiguring options via felt cost in hands and radiant hush; orientation anchors crisply by para 2, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall constrain choice (rich runoff soil enables planting) and charge final image (mist welcomes tree home); sensory hierarchy (mist kisses cheeks, air shimmers) reflects pruner's priorities, evolving causally without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) tightens accumulatively via density surge (shoot to echoes to bud), forcing endurance with legible cost (trembling hands foreclose prior orchard death); single deepening suffices, protagonist agency in song narrows lost-world options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's preservation emerges organically from seed-as-vessel and traveler echoes, with final bud offering resonant non-literal answer (sleeping, not lost) reweighting world's forgetting; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in echoes' longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (tracing bark as braille, spiraling patterns shift); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (hums vibrate bones to laughter chimes), purposeful compression taught early pays off in hush cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "seed pulsed faintly, as if in agreement" advances plot/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, figurative language purposeful without muddle or loops in peak growth beats.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom mysticism and upside-down tree lore transforms revival trope via seed-vessel logic; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with bud's gold-crimson inevitability from early patterns.</comment>
