<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in visions of other selves bleeding in, compelling clenched fists and door hesitation; earned stasis in letting go shows hierarchy of values with cost of other paths foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of timelines builds to CR closure—"He let go of the door"—with legible cost in unraveling whispers and wholeness; orientation anchors viaduct early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct's glowing stone and wet mud constrain inciting slip and tablet find, recharging final dimming image; sensory hierarchy (ozone, rain) mirrors internal fracture without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conquer self tightens via maze entry and confrontation, forcing renunciation with agency in door release; cost felt in "weight of every version" alters stance under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges organically from visions and tablet warning, resonant in final smooth clay without moralizing; reweights conquest premise in CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rune-shifting and timeline flickers; rhythmic diction modulates from viaduct hum to collapse without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax—"world snapped back... with a sound like breaking glass"—no loops or scaffolds; figurative "mad cartographer" purposeful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural timelines as self-labyrinth transforms trope into inevitable CR; risk in surreal confrontation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
