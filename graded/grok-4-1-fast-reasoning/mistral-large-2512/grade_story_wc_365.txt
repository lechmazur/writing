<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via shard hum syncing pulse and scanner use, with micro-choice of pulling shard revealing value hierarchy; other Kael applies crucible pressure. Internal conflict emerges in simultaneous curiosity and hesitation before lunge. Closure endurance/renunciation feels earned but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting in final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dreams lead to bay, scanner spikes summon other Kael, shard-console press triggers reveal. Orientation anchored early in repair bay details. Closure Charged Poise via crystallized choice ("redirect or let truth remain withheld") with conceptual cost ("crush us") legible in scale image, but decision merely stated without on-page act or final reconfiguration image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ozone/rust, fogged breath, blue scanner lines) filters through mapper's priorities, constraining choices via nexus thinning. Recurring shard as micro-setting charges final image. Atmosphere tensions concept without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent through crouch-to-console moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover withheld truth) signaled early, tightens causally via other Kael's lunge narrowing options to redirect/endure. Agency in scanner activation and shard press; moral calculus (truth's crushing weight) sharpens peak. Cost felt in "unraveling everything" warning and trembling bay, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented selves/truth's weight emerges organically via shard reprise and scale monument image reweighting premise. Subtext in other Kael's warnings vs. Kael's pull; final image offers resonant CR without moralizing. Complexity lingers in ambiguous decision embracing counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (dream echoes, shard pulse); voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive calm to crackling tension. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Some truths aren’t meant to be weighed"), distinguishing scarred Kael's roughness. No head-hopping; diction fits mapper's sensory lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers brushed... hummed... synced pulse" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in "air crackled... lunged." Minor paraphrase in truth-weight phrasing, but no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multiverse nexus with personal shard relic and self-confrontation; mirrors-city reveal transforms trope via scale motif. Risky ambiguous poise-heightens stakes organically; no derivative templates, feels inevitable from cyclical dreams setup.</comment>
