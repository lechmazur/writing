<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied guilt (fogging glasses, flinching at violin sound) and contradictory doubt-fueled micro-choices culminate in earned ritual apology; voice-specific metaphors reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup to Charged Poise closure (own-voice apology, cracking bottle with sizzling cost); oriented early (archive, Voss, Clara backstory cued concretely); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains ritual choice and charges final cracked image; sensory hierarchy (bergamot/lightning, rotting apples) filters through exorcist bias, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant reconnect/apology stake signaled early escalates accumulatively through ritual deepening (wire-winding, metaphor-speaking) to agency-driven release with legible emotional cost (shaky breath, imperfect miracle).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles/listening theme emerges organically from ritual failure-to-reconfiguration; final lighter smile amid falling trees offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting guilt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (tuning metaphors, static-whispers) with rhythmic modulation under ritual stress; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied openings, no loops); purposeful metaphors (grief-river) integrate without muddle in peak ritual beat; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism tropes via induction-coil ritual and perfume ghost-song synthesis; fresh metaphor-advising voice and orchard-chainsaw frame feel inevitable, risking quiet closure payoff.</comment>
