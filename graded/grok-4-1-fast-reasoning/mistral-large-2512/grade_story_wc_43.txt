<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's decisively kind micro-choices (no hesitation settling with guitar, pocketing shard despite tight throat) reveal values under pressure, earning endurance with felt emotional cost; Lena's serene request for mundane hymn adds particularity without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (scent, light, music) tightens toward Charged Poise closure in shard-pocketing and vigil image, reconfiguring brokenness with undeniable emotional cost legible in "throat tight" and fading light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radiant haven's frosted glass and cloud view constrain the hushed scene, mirroring internal peace and charging final twilight image; scent of hope and guitar integrate tactilely through action, with POV-biased sensory narrowing under emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early via call, deepens texturally through mundane hymn request narrowing to shard reunification; Elias's agency in singing and staying forecloses paths with throat-tight cost charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken endurance emerges organically from shard reunion and mundane hymn shifting to transcendent memory; final image non-literally answers goodbye's question by reweighting shards' jagged fit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third POV stable with Elias's biased perceptual signature (vinyl shard as anchor, light/scent as emotional filters); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Hymn the mundane" teases yet compels), rhythmic control heightens stillness without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying from strum-resonant chords to breath-slowing taps; "pulsing stillness" recurs pattern-taught without loop, propelling to closure image; no scaffold or figurative muddle in peak shard beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hospice therapist "hymning the mundane" transforms deathbed trope via vinyl shards' non-fixed reunity and literalized "scent of hope"; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, with cloud-haven risking bold lyric poise.</comment>
