<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (paddling vs warring heart/actions), with final renunciation of compass earned via embodied micro-choices like deeper paddle dips and island drift; flaws (blind paternal loyalty) compound before release. Interiority particular (stars as scripture) without diagnostic labels. Voice coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of regrets/reflections tightens to on-page CR/RR (compass hurled, "ripples fading as quickly as his old life") with legible emotional cost in final image. Continuous single scene; orientation anchored by ~50 words (dawn launch, Elias's vest). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring compass and kayak constrain choices (wobbles, slips, hurled), charging closure image; sensory hierarchy POV-biased (utility poles as "constants" amid chaos). Jagged rocks, saltwater spray tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal drift. Micro-setting (hull scraping pebbles) evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heart/actions alignment vs regrets' pull) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via laugh/sob reversal and unplanned island pull, forcing trade-off (hurl compass); cost unmistakable in "weight... unbearable" and foreclosed paternal path. Agency in endurance then decisive release under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer in sunlit rocks/final choice reweights navigation premise (stars/poles to self-charting) via particulars (compass swallow); theme emerges organically from conflicted arc without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in "tide... coming in" counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (celestial metaphors filter world: "pride... another kind of gravity"); rhythm modulates (short gust spray sentences heighten, longer reflections breathe). No elision or head-hopping; diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pushed off, paddling... horizon blurred"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/paraphrase churn or filter stacks. Minor figurative density in reflections ("broken teeth," "pulling... tide") coherent, no muddle at peak hurl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: failed stargazer's kayak odyssey transforms tropes via utility poles contrast and compass hurl as paternal severance; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically (+0.3). Non-obvious island pull inevitable from particulars.</comment>
