<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices under pressure, like kneeling to gather driftwood and carving the bridge, reveal a hierarchy of values with embodied contradiction between doubt and adaptation. Interiority concrete in "hands itched," aligning with sculptor traits. Minor label-speak in "perpetually learning" slightly undercuts full embodiment without a pivotal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: slide shattering rearranges into mosaic → voice summons Mara → cavern reveal → carving tightens density to CR closure where bridge flares and Elias integrates with felt commitment cost in "didn’t know how long he’d stay." Orientation anchored early (Elias at cliffs post-GPS by para 2). One transition legible, no shards excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood from cavern floor constrains carving choice; storm-tossed archway and pulsing cavern walls charge final bridge image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hums like turbines to sculptor). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild paths post-maps fail) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via slide incident deepening to carving agency that forecloses return with "endless work" cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at bridge completion. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from particulars like mosaic woman and bridge stitching eras; final "stitched into the fabric" reconfigures premise without moralizing. Subtext in layered driftwood meanings invites ambiguity on permanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in sculptor-biased noticing ("ship in the splinter"). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm at peak ("The turbines hummed louder, deeper"). Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("You’ve come to reimagine us").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors purposeful (driftwood weaving time) without muddle in closure beat. Rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds; minor density in opening storm risks overwrite but integrates. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood sculptor premise with timewoven cavern transforms portal fantasy via tactile carving closure. Risk in accumulative reverie heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable particulars like lantern mosaic.</comment>
