<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied fear as "first thread" compels trance micro-choices with contradictory impulses (failing/succeeding); final understanding earned via prior causal buildup in hands' smoothness, confronting flaw of withheld truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from ripples to frozen rings; CR closure lands on-page in exhaled silence and changed hands, cost legible in undone self-reappearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's pulsing hum and lodestone glow constrain trance kneeling/dipping; platform's cool surface and hovering tether charge final stand, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving vanishing tightens accumulatively to blinding glow/frozen rings; agency in weaving/exhaling forecloses reversal path with conceptual cost in presence realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stepping outside time emerges via rings/grandmother particulars reweighted in final hands/world smile; resonant CR answers without moral, embracing ambiguity of youth vs. presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature filters ripples/hum through Elara's bias; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with trance intensity, purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., rings "hung in the air, suspended like frozen breath"); zero loops/artifacts, rhythmic hush accelerates to silence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory/pond rings transforms aging trope; risk-taking in lyric CR (vanish to reappear) inevitable from grotto particulars, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
