<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in buried emotions surfacing without flinch during explosions, earning final acceptance of shard; internal conflict of perfection vs. breaking acts simultaneously in crucible scene. Minor slip in diagnostic "creative destruction" phrasing slightly undercuts unearned epiphany feel, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failures densify to "penny dropped" realization (pattern break), exploding crozier yields CR closure with legible cost in destroyed relic and warped acceptance ("wasn’t gold... enough"). Single scene tightly anchors orientation by para 2; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus and crozier as micro-settings constrain: nexus flares with explosions, crozier warps in heat charging final shard image. Sensory hierarchy (crimson glow, hissing mercury) filters through alchemist's priorities, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break failure cycle) signaled early in ledger; tightening via poured mercury/explosions forecloses gold path under Accumulative lens, with agency in unflinching endurance and cost in inferno's destruction visible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically from crozier break to shard, final image reweighting alchemy premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer to transformation question via jagged "new" metal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "vivify the dead metal"); rhythmic prose modulates from calculated to inferno poise, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (serpent thought coils to flames), no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies for pressure, "frozen bloom" line clean and propulsive at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy reframe from gold to breaking via crozier destruction feels inevitable; bold risk in explosive stasis image transforms trope organically.</comment>
