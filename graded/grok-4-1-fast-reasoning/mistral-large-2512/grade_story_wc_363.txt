<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies convincingly from bead's hum to journey's end, with embodied regret in "shawl damp with her own breath"; minor abstraction in final epiphany slightly undercuts contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to CR closure—"the silence between them was no longer raveling—it was complete"—with orchard-forgetting cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo "stoically sparkling" bookends constrain departure and charge final image as sentinels; selective sensory hush mirrors internal raveling without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver message before last light) tightens via journey hardships and Kael discovery under Accumulative lens; agency in pressing bead forecloses isolation with orchard-loss cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence-as-thread motif reweights from weight to beginning in CR without statement; final "silence was no longer a weight. It was a beginning" resonates non-literally from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("leaves trembling like the last notes of a forgotten song") modulates rhythm with pressure; stable close third-person filters all through Elara's wistful bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful weaving metaphors, but minor overwrite in repeated "stoically sparkling" risks pattern fatigue without variation; propulsion clear, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom/orchard unraveling into CR twist transforms isolation trope; bead-to-realization turn inevitable from established silence constraint.</comment>
