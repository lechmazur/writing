<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's lock sentinel expertise drives micro-choices like hairpin pry and vault knowledge, rooting motivation to spark revolution; embodied thrill coils with steady pulse, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from blackout entry to aide's deposit therefore letter discovery therefore torch signal as DC closure; "leaving the torch where it would be found" makes exposure cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss pulses constrain stealth in shadows, filtering through Mira's lock bias; blackout and armory torch charge final twilight exit image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to seize letters tightens via message revelation ("cradle of sparks"), forcing agency shift to torch signal with exposure cost; causal escalation narrows silent revolution options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spark motif emerges from letters' danger to Mira's ignited torch, reweighting silent cunning over force; final "somewhere, a spark caught" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in rune-etched goggles and cipher angles; rhythmic prose ("winking hush of a thing") modulates intrigue without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action with sensory propulsion ("torch flared to life, casting her shadow long"); zero loops or artifacts, varied rhythm sustains momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lock sentinel igniting revolution via quill cipher transforms heist into subtle spark motif; fresh biolum fort synthesis feels organic, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
