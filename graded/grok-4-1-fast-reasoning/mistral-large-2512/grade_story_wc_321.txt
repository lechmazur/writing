<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's resilient positivity drives the climax speech to passengers amid vanishing threat, earning closure endurance with embodied chest-tightening tension; Veyra applies light pressure via radio mutter. Minor label-speak in "resiliently positive" diagnostic slightly abstracts mid-crisis insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: radio incites density build via passengers/echoes, tightening to Elias's pattern-listening act yielding resonant reconfiguration (merger empties grotto) with felt cost in timeline pull and steady lantern image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spectral grotto arches/stars constrain choices by weaving time threads that bridge ferry/heart, charging final empty image; sensory selectivity (ozone/old paper) mirrors unraveling urgency through Elias's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ferry vanishing via sideways clocks) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as passengers densify pressure, narrowing to Elias's agency in speech/merger with legible cost in groaned timbers and foreclosed lost state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time-as-tide/merging theme emerges via hourglass/stars/particulars, resonating in final "spaces between seconds" image reweighting premise without moralizing; earned via positivity complicating endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (stars as loom/threads); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Maybe we just need to listen"), modulating rhythm under stress without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere; minor figurative density ("stars bent like broken glass") in climax risks slight muddle but pattern-taught via pulsing motifs supports propulsion without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-slip ferry with "permanent transient" frame transformed via patterns/hourglass; risk in ghostly merger heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
