<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through winder's lens ("measured his life in quarter-turns"); contradictory guilt-duty impulses act in carving/transferring sins; final unburdening earned with embodied cost ("hands unburdened"). Flawless under pressure, no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sins builds to RR closure ("balance had been restored... carrying them forward, lighter now, shared") with legible conceptual cost in final swing/image. Orientation anchored early (ridge, tower, night); single shard coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and tower constrain climb/choice ("treacherous, slick with spray"); sensory hierarchy (hissing waves, glinting inscriptions) biases to winder's tactile priorities; final ridge softening charges image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early ("pendulum’s pause was a wound"); tightening via name transfers narrows options under lens (tremble to full swing), agency in pressing inscriptions forecloses imbalance with visible cost ("sins... shared"). Escalation decisive, no static loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared burden emerges organically from particulars (inscriptions transferred, not erased); final image ("pendulum’s swing... a promise") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "carrying them forward."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with winder-specific perceptual signature ("balance was sacred"); rhythmic modulation accelerates at transfer ("tremble... ripple... sway"); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("slicing time into perfect, forgiving slices"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("jagged teeth biting... gnomon"); propulsion peaks cleanly at chime without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwinder guilt + rake-to-bob transfer transforms absolution trope; irreplaceable premise ("names into the brass") inevitable in hindsight; risk of poetic conceit heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
