<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in hesitant first cut yielding to carving; earned renunciation of "harvesting lessons" via prior grief rituals forecloses escape with felt cost in final lion touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from tea ritual to carving realization; Charged Poise closure in "some things couldn’t be contained, only held" reconfigures grief stake with undeniable emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skylight's fractured/muted light and ash wood constrain carving choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (steam ghosts, scuffing slippers) mirrors internal crystallization without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting grief tightens texturally through carving deepening that narrows "outrun vs. contain" options; agency in blade strokes forces trade-off, cost legible in quiet lion's embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of holding vs. harvesting emerges organically from wood-to-lion arc, final image resonantly reweights premise without moral; ambiguity in "companion, here and gone" invites lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in grief-tinted noticing (e.g., "drowning dancers"); rhythmic modulation peaks in carving strokes, diction biased and controlled under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "blade catching the light like a sliver of moon" advances action/atmosphere); zero loops, varied rhythm propels to crisp closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lion-tamer widow trope via "quiet lion" carving as grief companion; risk in lyric accumulative design heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
