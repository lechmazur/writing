<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with personal loss mirroring the stake in small objects; contradictory hope amid sorrow drives micro-choices like pursuing the trail. Earned reconfiguration from burden to reminder shows change with felt cost. Minor label-speak in "magnify small kindnesses" slightly abstracts motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as clue density (button, dust, postcard) builds to Charged Poise closure; reconfiguration legible in final note and burden shift with emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in file room post-emancipation. One deepening via landlady tightens knowledge without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-settings constrain reading histories and charge final image reprise. Sensory details (yellowed paper, tarnished brass) selective via archivist bias, mirroring internal states. Boarding house evolves causally, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover via button signaled early; density tightening via postcard narrows to peace found, reweighting under Accumulative lens. Agency in pursuit forecloses inaction with emotional ache cost, felt in chest tightening. Quiet pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of small objects holding histories emerges organically from button trail and dust reading, resonant in final image reweighting burden without moralizing. Subtext in grief parallels adds complexity. No overt statements; ambiguity in Daniel's peace invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing; voice rhythmic, modulating from sorrowful to hopeful. Landlady dialogue natural, subtexted in hesitation. Clean free indirect style ties syntax to emotional state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "stories"/"histories" (e.g., opening to mid) and repetitive "weight" motifs dull propulsion slightly. No closure artifacts; vivid specificity drives momentum. Varied syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist noticing overlooked clues transforms lost histories trope; button trail risks quiet lyricism heightening emotional specificity. Non-obvious angle on post-war fragments feels organic, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
