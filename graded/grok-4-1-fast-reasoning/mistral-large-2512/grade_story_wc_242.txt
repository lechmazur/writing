<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied vibrations from disc and caller voices reveals contradictory care amid estrangement; micro-choices like murmuring without correction earn endurance at closure, though peak lacks simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of looped voices to cadence shift with woman's "I think I'm ready" and boy's silence, landing Charged Poise CR in final disc-pressing image where cost ("wondered if she had done enough") reconfigures her role legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring glass disc as micro-setting constrains reflective walks and charges final image; sensory details like damp concrete/ozone filter through Mara's familiarity bias, guiding choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of estrangement vs. efficacy tightens accumulatively via caller vignettes to woman's readiness forcing stance crystallization; agency in endurance forecloses correction path with felt uncertainty cost at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of endings-beginning emerges organically from looped wrong numbers and disc vibrations, reweighted non-literally by final wondering without moralizing; subtext in silence/implication invites ambiguity on sufficiency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (tunnel "kingdom," disc as "held breath"); rhythmic syntax modulates reflective intensity, diction biased toward haunted quietude without withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/atmospheric propulsion without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm breathes with scene, zero figurative muddle, precise verbs like "murmur" advance beats cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh underground operator premise transformed via melodically haunted disc and wrong-number loops into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens estrangement stakes organically.</comment>
