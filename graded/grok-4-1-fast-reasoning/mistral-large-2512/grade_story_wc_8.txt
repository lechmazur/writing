<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as "archivist of last resort" roots clear traits and compels the preservation choice with felt cost in the collector plan; contradictory impulses on lie vs. truth act in the scribe parallel moment. Liora's rivalry applies pressure via dialogue, forcing micro-choice to reveal intent. Minor slip: interiority occasionally abstracts dilemma before full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: petal drop → arrival → discovery → creak confrontation → dialogue realization → joint exit with RR closure (legacy rewritten, ambiguity preserved). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (station, Elias, evening chill). Cost legible in final image of rosebush and ivy, foreclosing pure exposure path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp stone, crunching leaves, fogging spectacles) filter through Elias's priorities; rosebush and ivy recur to constrain timing and charge final glance back. Setting guides choice via loose board and isolation. For 9+ gate, rosebush/ivy constrain timing and mirror fragility in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve letter's dual truth/lie) signaled early, tightens via Liora's counter ("erodes trust") forcing explanation of collector display. Agency in nod and exit crystallizes stance under causal lens. Cost visible in foreclosed narratives (village heroism vs. historical trust).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically from scribe marginalia, dialogue debate, and collector plan without statement. Final image (ivy swaying, bare rosebush) offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting ambiguity as kindness. No moralizing; complexity lingers in spectrum acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias (patterns, provenance); dialogue natural, subtextual (Liora's "preserving it" realization), distinct voices. Rhythmic control modulates tension. Prose texture distinct without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (ivy "grasping fingers" echoed in sway). Minor paraphrase loop in "noble lie" repeats, but anchored to pressure. No artifacts dull closure; propulsion clear in action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: historian theft as moral preservation via dual display transforms relic trope. Scribe parallel and rose timer add ingenuity without gimmick. Risks ambiguity embrace heighten stakes organically.</comment>
