<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's expertise shines in reading "the unspoken—the way a page’s edge curled," rooting her motivation and micro-choices like renegotiating terms. Time traveler feels generic despite wild eyes. Closure choice to step forward feels earned by prior resourcefulness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal pursuit + accumulative images) holds to CR closure: sister's appearance reconfigures solo quest with conceptual cost in "lessons... never meant to be learned alone." One tightening via door suffices; oriented early in mountain bookstore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shifting shelves and "air hummed with... panic" constrain navigation, mirroring internal states through Elara's biased filter. Final vast library veins charge closure image, with body (satchel heartbeat) as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find library/sister) tightens via renegotiation narrowing options; reveal forces stance crystallization under hybrid lens. Agency in pushing door; cost felt in pounding heart and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of buried mistakes emerging via shifting titles and sister inks hands reweights isolation organically. Final image answers "how does it work?" non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature ("spines... like living things"); dialogue subtextual ("renegotiate the terms") advances goals. Rhythm modulates to charged poise at reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel without loops; metaphors cohere (e.g., "second heartbeat"). No artifacts dull peak reveal; read-aloud rhythm peaks crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookstore-mountain and unlearned lessons transforms tropes; risk in CR ending heightens stakes via irreplaceable conceptual pivot.</comment>
