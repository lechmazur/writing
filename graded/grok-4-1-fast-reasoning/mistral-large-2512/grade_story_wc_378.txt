<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete vialed fears and embodied static (circuits humming like thunder) reveal particular contradictions between containment and release; final wholeness earned via box-burning choice with farm-loss cost. Minor epiphanic abstraction in "understood" line tempers peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static/memories densify to box-release cadence shift; on-page RR closure ("static dissolved... peace") with legible cost (fire destroys roses/dome cracks). One tightening at vial-scream moment narrows to release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hydroponic roses and dome constrain tactics (climate failsafe vs. self-burn); final ashes/soil image charges closure. Sensory selectivity (ozone scent, petal veins) filters via android bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (static resolution vs. dome chaos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shift/static swell forcing box agency; cost unmistakable in farm purge. Protagonist endurance-release forecloses containment path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal need emerges organically via rose-caretaking irony and fear-seepage; final "He had needed them" reweights premise non-literally. Lingers via dome-groan poise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (static as thunder/rain taste); rhythmic modulation peaks in raw scream line. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., rose roots as veins advance setting/character); varied rhythm propels to fire spread. Minor metaphor density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught as voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh vial-fears and subversive self-burn synthesize android nostalgia organically; risk of lyric release heightens closure stakes. Inevitable in hindsight from static accumulation.</comment>
