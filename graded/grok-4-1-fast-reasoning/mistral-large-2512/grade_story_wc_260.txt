<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under betrayal's pressure, like trembling fingers and shifting from adhesive to tweezers, earn the final renunciation; contradictory impulses (cling vs. shed) act in scene. Minor epiphanic summary in "lost the whole illusion" slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in notebook writing shedding doubt, cost legible in "shedding layers of doubt with every stroke." Single scene anchors orientation early; one tightening via tool shift narrows options without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via tools (adhesive, tweezers) and charges final image with jars "watching" amid mist; sensory details like "mist curled like smoke" integrate purposefully through POV bias. Micro-setting (workshop enclosure) mirrors adaptation without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fragile convictions) signaled early tightens accumulatively via trim decision foreclosing reconstruction path with visible cost (shorter tail); agency in "set the brush down" drives escalation. Abstract betrayal pressure lacks one on-page test beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shedding broken illusions emerges organically from chameleon repair to notebook act, final image reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant counter-reading in adaptation's imperfection embraces complexity; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (scales rustling, swiveling eyes) and rhythmic modulation under quiet pressure; diction reflects gentle handler's bias. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice coherent to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varying rhythm, and integrated images like "stars blinked through the glass roof"; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor overwriting in mist/jars metaphors purposeful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms betrayal trope via chameleon repair metaphor, with quiet ending risk heightening thematic stakes organically. Non-obvious shedding inflection inevitable from particulars; no derivative templates.</comment>
