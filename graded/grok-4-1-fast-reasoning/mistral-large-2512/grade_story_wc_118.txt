<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in consistent traits drives higher-stakes probing of diaries and tapestry; interiority concrete via stained fingers and palm to concrete. Internal conflict emerges subtly in wondering if chasing cracks wrong direction, embodied in shallow breath. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more reflective than simultaneous in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of perceptions (shadows pooling, diaries entries, thrum) builds to CR closure ("It wasn’t a pattern. It was a door.") with conceptual cost in worldview repricing. Orientation anchored early (silo, Elara, post-dream context). Single scene coherent, no shards; cost legible in reality-tilting final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's concrete ribs, wheat/rust smell, thrum constrain and charge final groan/tilt, mirroring internal states via tactile hum. Recurring tapestry/object evolves through action (spread on desk, dragons gleam). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pulse points on spines); micro-setting (concrete palm-press) shapes choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map dragons/axis via walls' stories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via diary entries tightening to "dragons lifted their heads," narrowing options to reach. Agency in probing/reaching forecloses past-chasing path; felt cost in shelves sliding/unraveling threads under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (stories ahead in threads, not past) emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR reweighting premise without moral: "the last human dream had been the key, not the end." Subtext in implication/silence (walls waiting); lingering ambiguity invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cracks leaking meaning, reflections flickering); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences at "shelves seemed to tilt"). Diction purposeful, biased (time slippery); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "fingers, always slightly stained... traced the spines" advances character/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (curling like dying leaves). Propulsion peaks cleanly at closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-dream silo library with tapestry-door reconfigures mythic dragons into axis-shift premise organically. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative texture heightens stakes; no template echoes, inevitable hindsight from thrum/tapestry buildup.</comment>
