<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to feel connection's texture drives micro-choices like hesitating then following the thread, with embodied calm amid unraveling ("strange calm in the way the world unraveled"). Internal conflict surfaces in rationalizing magic, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the eruption beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from thread clinging to illusions erupting to void entry; closure as CR in final image ("thread...connecting him to something...alive") with cost (door vanishes, isolation in dream space). Orientation anchored early; one tightening at "memories altered" reweights reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's tilting floors, shifting walls constrain choices (thread tugs forward); thread as recurring object charges final image, mirroring internal blur. Sensory selection (pulsing thread, sinking floor) reflects architect's perceptual bias under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reality vs dream leak) signaled early, tightens texturally at eruption narrowing to connection pursuit; agency in following thread forecloses gallery return with felt void cost. Escalation coherent under lens, but minor abstract stakes linger pre-eruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of connection's physical texture emerges organically via thread weaving illusions/memories, resonant in final "texture...alive" reweighting "rational enchantment" without moralizing. Subtext in calm unraveling invites ambiguity on magic's rules.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (geometries blurring); rhythmic prose modulates to shorter lines in eruption ("endlessly; the next, collapsed"). No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (vein of liquid silver evolves to binding). Minor paraphrase loops on thread pulsing/repeating in mid-beats dull propulsion slightly before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream architecture leaking via living thread transforms optical illusions trope; risk in surreal escalation ("feet...sinking like quicksand") heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
