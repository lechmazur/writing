<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in gardener traits compels orchestration; final fade as earned renunciation with cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a dramatized scene, but observation under pressure reveals values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: message pattern density tightens to RR closure in "she let herself fade, her last thought a whisper"—conceptual cost undeniable as purpose fulfilled forecloses her presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches "sang when touched" constrain villager experiments; nebula/trees charge final harmony image. Sensory integration purposeful, POV-filtered via ghostly watchfulness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard stake signaled early, escalates via message cadence under accumulative lens; Liora's agency narrows options, cost felt in fade after collective shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of partnership emerges via shifting messages; final "You were always the gardeners" reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting hoarding to love without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with ghostly perceptual bias ("hovered near the bell, willing it"); lyrical rhythm modulates from watchful to resonant fade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel accumulative beats; minor figurative density ("nebula itself had bled") purposeful without muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-ecology sci-fantasy; floating arches/nebula transform tropes organically, risk in ghostly agency heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
