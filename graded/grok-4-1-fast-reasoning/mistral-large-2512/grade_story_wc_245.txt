<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotions and sensory interiority ground Liora deeply, as in vibrations "in her bones" and chest; motivation to dowse intensifies via compass spin, earning self-understanding at tree without unearned epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: trail notes build density to stillpoint RR (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "never find the stillpoint again" and ring pointing inward. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, closure reconfigures emotional map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains path via felt hums and thinning trees; compass ring as micro-setting charges final image when cold and inward-pointing. Sensory filter through blind POV (touch/vibration) vivid and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-understanding at stillpoint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening melody density ("frequency just below pain") to palm-press agency narrowing options. Cost felt in irreversible internalization, charging end without decisive reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping emotional depths emerges organically via vibration absorption to "silence between the notes"; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like grief-song avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrational/musical lens, e.g., "leaves trembling like strings"); rhythmic lyricism modulates pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent and pattern-taught (musical hums), no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in climax ("notes coiled...seeping into her skin") purposeful for texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sensory navigation and emotional cartography transforms tropes; ultrasonic world and stillpoint premise feel inevitable, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
