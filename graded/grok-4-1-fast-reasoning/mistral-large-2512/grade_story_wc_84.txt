<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's embodied reactions (hands shake, thread tugging chest) reveal contradiction under pressure; earned nod forecloses isolation with felt personal cost. Pilgrim's traits shown through actions but verge on archetypal, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from chip pulse to resonant tone and station reveal; closure as Charged Poise/CR lands on-page with hesitation/nod reconfiguring belonging, cost legible in "hands shook" and internal thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's mechanisms and dome constrain drone action; dusk-to-stars evolution charges final image where "stars would wait. But the call wouldn’t," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal belonging frequency) signaled early, deepens via chip activation and star patterns narrowing to personal pull; agency in pressing chip and nod, cost in foreclosed hesitation unmistakable on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal belonging emerges organically from frequency images and realization ("missing pieces... in here"); final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing, resonant with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Elias POV with perceptual bias (sharp eyes on hologram/sky); distinct voice in rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity, dialogue carries subtext ("Not decode... Reveal").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors integrated into action (dome "yawned open like a forgotten mouth"); no loops or artifacts dull peak drone feed stabilization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi signals and internal belonging transforms seeker tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via chip's evolving glow without gimmickry.</comment>
