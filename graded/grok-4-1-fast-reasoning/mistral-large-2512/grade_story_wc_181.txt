<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bewildered curator's embodied shift from trembling fingers over glass to heart-pounding pursuit feels earned through contradictory ignore-inquire impulses, with micro-choices like bolting upright revealing values under orchard pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as shell bafflement density tightens via bath inquiry to CR closure; orchard trees bending on glass-touch reconfigures nonlinear premise with lived-knowledge cost, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pistachio shell as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final pulse-image; astral orchard's starlit twists and disquieting hum mirror internal states through selective, tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bath inquiry deepens dominant stake from logic-puzzle to pursuit-path under textural lens, foreclosing solve-option with brightened disquiet cost crystallized in awe-smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell-waiting image offers non-literal answer to inheritance riddle, reweighting fragments as upward path without moralizing; emergent complexity lingers in orchard symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward humming blossoms and pulsing shells; lyrical rhythm modulates from whisper-forgotten calm to shifted-trees intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures like "nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs"; no loops, clear propulsion to "trees bent toward her" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pistachio shell cameo blank as time-vessel synthesizes sci-fi orchard tropes into inevitable CR, with risky lyric realization heightening conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
