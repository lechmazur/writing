<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's hesitation over keys embodies contradictory grief and resolve before the encore, with clock-winding ritual revealing particular traits under pressure. Final play earns change via prior causality. Minor genericism in travelers as pressure doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: film reel idea → wait until horizon → unplanned encore causes arbor tremble, clouds part, clock tick as DC with emotional cost legible in final line. Orientation anchored immediately in arbor and pianist role. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal arbor constrains wait and isolates performance, charging closure via bioluminescent moss and rising spray misting face. Sensory details (creak, salt mist) filter through Elias's musical perception, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-escape stake signaled via clock/film early; encore switch tightens via agency, narrowing to risk of fate's surprise with cost in discordant vulnerability. Pressure coheres causally to closure reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of creative loophole against grief emerges organically via clock reprise reweighting silence to motion, offering non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. Particulars like film-summoned storm charge resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical metaphors (notes as bridges/smoke); rhythmic control heightens tension in "deliberate clumsiness" scale before peak. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("sound rise like smoke"); varied syntax/rhythm accelerates to closure without loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors—coherent sea/music vehicles enhance peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pianist-summoning via arbor's chaos transforms grief trope; encore as fate-surprise feels inevitable from film seed, with risk-taking in discordant piece heightening stakes.</comment>
