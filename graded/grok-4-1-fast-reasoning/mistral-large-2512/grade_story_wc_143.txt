<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied actions like gloved fingers in regolith and breath fogging helmet; realization about sand grain's purpose earned through endurance. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("purposefully curious") slightly abstracts traits without full embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure; cost legible in "some moments—some things—were never meant to last," reweighting premise of preservation. Orientation anchored early at Mons Huygens; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective lunar details (regolith static, micro-impacts) constrain via suit limits and charge final image of moon's glow guiding return. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Earthrise glare vs. quiet hush); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph last crater) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via outlasting nights to renunciation of permanence; agency in endurance forecloses denial with felt cost. Minor abstractness in isolation pressure lacks one visceral loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges organically from particulars like chemical color shift and sand grain; final image resonant CR reweights preservation without moralizing. Subtext in "beauty as a kind of proof" lingers via ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature (cosmic violence frozen); rhythmic modulation peaks in shutter "sigh." Diction controlled, poetic without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm supports hush (e.g., short shutter beat). Minor simile density ("slow-dying ember," "jagged crown") risks overwrite but pattern-taught for melancholy tone, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar relic-preservation with personal transience via sand grain/chemical motifs; risk in lyric hush transforms sci-fi trope. Ingenuity in chemical timed message as tangible time bend.</comment>
