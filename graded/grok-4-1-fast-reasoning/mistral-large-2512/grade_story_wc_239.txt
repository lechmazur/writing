<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority ties motivation to dictionary and defiance as last witness; embodied actions like tracing spine and pressing book reveal values under cosmic pressure. Minor slip: contradictory impulses on "truth" definition feel summarized rather than simultaneous in peak kneel moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page CR closure: weaving threads reconfigures illusions with conceptual cost of transformation into "first weaver." Orientation anchors Elara/temple early; single-shard transition to void legible, one tightening via stone flare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Temple library and arbitration stone constrain choice (pressing dictionary activates) and charge final void image; sensory hush/dust selective and POV-biased to urgency. Micro-setting of stone/book evolves causally to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify fading words/illusions) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via stone darkening to void weaving; agency in kneeling/pressing forecloses temple stasis with transformation cost legible in dictionary's absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically via dictionary definitions and spiral process, reweighted in final weaving image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to split "truth" resolves via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (poetic precision on time/unraveling); rhythmic modulation builds hush to void silence, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but dense figurative language ("ribs of a forgotten god," "veins of light") borders overwriting in opening beat without pattern payoff, slightly dulling early propulsion; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary as arbitration anchor transforms cosmic witness trope; spiral concept and void weaving feel inevitable from established particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
