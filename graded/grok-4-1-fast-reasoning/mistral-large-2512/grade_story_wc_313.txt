<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the shift from father's stories to pocketing photos, with embodied cost ("weight... settling into his bones") earning the renunciation; no stock epiphanies, traits shown via vigilant actions against forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via photo trail tightening knowledge to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in final pocketed photos and bone-weight image, with distillery arrival as meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reservoir's "dark mirror" and distillery's "damp wood and... fermented berries" constrain path and charge final image; sensory hierarchy reflects warden's priorities, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bury vs share past) signaled early, accumulatively escalates via photos narrowing to endurance choice; cost felt in foreclosed burning path, though internal alone limits visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resurfacing town reweights forgetting vs memory through photo particulars, culminating in non-literal final image ("levee would hold... stories had to be told"); emergent, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward relics and water; rhythmic modulation peaks in "whispering... voices from the deep," with purposeful compression teaching lyric accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and openings; no loops or artifacts, figurative coherence ("bones of a forgotten song") integrates without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of personal history in resurfaced town transforms flood trope; risk in reflective drive pays off, though reservoir-resurfacing echoes familiar genre without bold subversion.</comment>
