<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Honesty trait embodied concretely in peripheral restraint and doubt constraining realization; internal contradiction via doubt vs. task shows simultaneously without safety-hedging. Final reconfiguration earned through prior micro-choices like kneeling and not turning. Minor limitation: prophet's direct wisdom reduces relational crucible pressure on line walker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from murmurs to clearing bloom and golden thread CR, reweighting preservation premise with doubt-cost legible in "Your doubt keeps it pure." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in opening paragraph. Persistent peripheral constraint shapes tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion and parapet constrain choices via vibrations and murmurs fading into silence, charging final image; mask warms as recurring body-object reconfigures under pressure. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (grain whispers, bone-words). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (consecrate/preserve echo) signaled early, escalates texturally via prophet shadow to clearing/thread touch narrowing to realization-deepening. Agency in reaching hums cost (doubt pure); one decisive intensification suffices. Moral calculus between hoard vs. pass-through charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unfiltered truth emerges organically via thread image shifting from concealment to passage; resonant non-literal CR answers "what to preserve" with doubt-cost. Complexity in lie-dressed-truth lingers without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from honesty-flaw friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in selective driftwood/ vibration noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to thick-air hush. Stable single-POV, bone-dialogue subtextual and goal-pursuing without exposition. No head-hopping, elision purposeful for peripheral tension payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., mask flaring integrates sense/character/action); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful and consistent (skeletal hand, spider silk), no muddle in peak clearing beat. Minor register elevation in prophetic speech fits mystic idiom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic walker-tropes via peripheral mechanics and echo-preservation rule-set; bold textural risk heightens stakes in thread poise. Non-obvious angle on wisdom as passage transforms prophecy genre. Irreplaceable particulars like mask-half balance concealment/truth.</comment>
