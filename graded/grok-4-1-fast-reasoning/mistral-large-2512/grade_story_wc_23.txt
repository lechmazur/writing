<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's embodied actions like tracing shifting symbols with his thumb ground interiority and motivation in concrete particularity. Endurance of loss feels earned through prior calls and notebook-building. No major contradictions act simultaneously, limiting 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds to Charged Poise closure in final lines where Elias smiles at distant waves, reweighting loss as rebuildable with endurance cost. Orientation anchors early (signal station, dried sea). Phone call delivers single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Censer as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (placed on desk, packed) and charges final image. Sensory selectivity (salt/rust scent, crunching glass) reflects POV urgency. Cap at 8.8 per Q2 &lt;9.0 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss via censer/calls) signaled early; symbols' shift and phone whisper deepen under textural lens, narrowing to endurance agency. Cost legible in foreclosed escape from paths of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of loss as bridge emerges organically from censer symbols and reverse migration images, resonant in final reconfiguration without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of rebuilding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (geography of loss filters ruins). Rhythmic control modulates reflective to charged poise at end. Cap at 8.8 per Q2 &lt;9.0 gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (symbols "fading in and out like breath") taught early, propels without loops. Minor density risks overwrite in opening but serves textural lens payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-aquatic ruins, fluctuating censer, and cryptic calls transforms quest trope into textural endurance. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes. Cap at 8.8 per Q2 &lt;9.0 gate.</comment>
