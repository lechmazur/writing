<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in artist's precision and refusal of forgery, with contradictory impulses in trembling fingers; final pursuit to archives earned by escalating discoveries. Minor flaw: certainty of intent ("no accident") slightly told rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from plate discovery to staircase reveal as Decisive Change; orientation anchored early in studio; closure cost legible in "narrow staircase descending into darkness" committing her path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "humid embrace, scent of damp earth and decay" mirrors internal wilt and pressures archive choice; recurring glass domes constrain navigation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering lost truths escalates causally through plate-map-archive discoveries, narrowing options with agency in piecing/prying; cost felt in journey amid decay, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honesty amid lost words emerges organically from forgery refusal, map legend, and Echo Vault pursuit; resonant non-literal close in staircase reweights "truth waits" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in artist's eye ("traced her fingers," "gilding leaves"); poetic diction like "sky the color of old bruises" modulates rhythm purposefully under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent ("wilt near dishonesty"); minor simile density in opening but purposeful for atmosphere, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-oasis greenhouse world and Echo Vault premise transforms treasure-map trope through artist's recovery of words; risk in quiet discovery heightens stakes organically.</comment>
