<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots clearly in grandfather's clock and overheard talks, compelling higher-stakes choices like fitting the weight and hanging posters. Interiority shows concrete precision in "hands moving with the same precision she used to arrange choral scores," but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of community-building feels earned with her ongoing library work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from inspiration to gathering to weeks-later resonance. Closure lands as Charged Poise in final platform image, reconfiguring silos into bridges with conceptual cost of sustained effort legible in "her work not finished, but begun." Orientation anchors early; one meaningful tightening at the chimes igniting song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower's brass hands and gears constrain choices, like fitting the weight that "clicked into place"; dust and lanterns filter through Mara's tactile work. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound in rehab, mirroring choral precision. Final gleaming weight charges closure image, qualifying micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unity signaled early via elevator talks; accumulative deepening at gathering where hesitant voices weave, foreclosing isolation with felt cost of her dawn-to-dusk labor. Agency in pulling the cord crystallizes stance. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony from fragments emerges via gears/languages motif shifting to communal song, reweighting silos in final chorus "that needed no translation." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like cuckoo weight's reprise avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from bridging question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical metaphors like "missing syllable in a hymn." Voice modulates rhythmically, compressing at gathering climax. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in Mara's multilingual intro.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "its chimes ringing out in a rhythm that felt like a heartbeat" advancing multiple layers, but figurative overload in peak gathering ("groaned to life, heartbeat") mixes vehicles, dulling slightly. Minor paraphrase on unity voices. Rhythm varies without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral librarian rehabbing clock for multilingual unity transforms community trope via clock mechanics as bridge metaphor. Risk in time-jumping structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. Specifics like Polish/Spanish fragments feel lived-in.</comment>
