<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Meekness shown through gentle hands and hunched shoulders contrasts with fire beneath, driving resolve to save orchards; earned change in "shoulders a little straighter" with embodied sweat cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: leaching discovery therefore silk use therefore sealing DC with on-page cost ("worked through the night"); orientation anchored early in orchards/mines; closure reconfiguration legible in dawn emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating arches and leaching shafts constrain delicate sealing choice; sensory hierarchy (hammer ring to drip, rust) biases via blacksmith lens; azure haze recurs to charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchards dying) tightens via fissure entry narrowing options; agency in coaxing silk earns resolution; visible cost (night's labor) alters posture at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quiet defiance theme emerges organically from meek resolve mending scars, resonant in "azure defiance stitching the wound"; no moralizing, ambiguity in planet's weariness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with blacksmith perceptual signature (ore veins humming); rhythmic prose modulates from steady hammer to mine groans; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via integrated sensory action; minor figurative density ("danced like ghosts") purposeful without muddle in peak fissure beat; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating mine orchards and living silk transforms fantasy tropes; risk in solo subtle heroism heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable world logic drives closure.</comment>
