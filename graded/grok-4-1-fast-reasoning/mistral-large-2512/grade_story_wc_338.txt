<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority via map-framing insights and embodied curiosity (tracing tear with thumb); final understanding earned through accumulating discoveries without unearned epiphany. Methodical trait constrains safe village life for mystery pursuit with felt fool's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered clues (map tear, films, shoe) build density to CR closure: "the map had torn because the story was not yet finished," reweighting silence as living with undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frescoes recur to constrain perception and charge chapel altar image; rain, moss, dust tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal mystery while guiding pry-bar choice at rusted door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break suffocating silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing interpretive options; agency in reopening forces trade-off with village judgment, cost felt in dust/incense confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished stories emerges organically from map tear, blurred figures, child shoe; final CR reweights silence premise non-literally without moralizing, lingering ambiguity in "voices waiting to be heard."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in edge-noticing diction ("ink bled at the folds"); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate to breathless at door swing and altar reveal, POV stable and biased toward silences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tear was his own: a jagged rift" advances plot/character); varied syntax propels to crisp final image, zero loops or artifacts even in peak chapel entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-framer's empathy decoding silence via films/maps transforms ghost-trope into quiet CR; risk in shielded lyric tone heightens mystery stakes organically.</comment>
