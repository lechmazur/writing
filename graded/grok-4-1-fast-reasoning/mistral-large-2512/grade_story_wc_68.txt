<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driven by obsessive rebellion rooted in isolation, Elias's micro-choices (arranging notes, pocketing cog) build to earned emergence; internal conflict in "couldn’t let it go" shows contradictory impulses with isolation cost, unmarred to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from cog study to decision (Charged Poise closure: "stepped into the unknown" with exposure cost legible); single scene anchors orientation early, one tightening via apathy realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sewer damp/reek and cog silt constrain obsession and force emergence choice; sensory hierarchy (rats, flickering candle) mirrors priorities, charges final submerged archway image without slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. apathy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to foreclose isolation via agency-packed decision; cost felt in leaving sewer safety, coherent pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically via layered notes/cog, final surfacing reweights preservation theme without statement; resonant ambiguity in dockworkers' potential rejection lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sediments as "stories"); rhythmic control modulates brooding calm to resolve, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops (minor "story" echoes purposeful); concrete images replace generics, clean to "stepped into the unknown" propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sediment-decoded cog transforms relic trope into truth-key; fresh synthesis of sunken philosopher's rebellion risks bold isolation payoff, organic to closure.</comment>
