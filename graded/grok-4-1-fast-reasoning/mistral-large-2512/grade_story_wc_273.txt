<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via curiosity drawing Elias to unnatural elements, culminating in instinctive lunge at ink that reveals character under crisis pressure; micro-choices like sprinting to scream and grabbing "liquid shadow" align with tracker traits and show serene anger. Minor flaw: internal conflict more sequential than simultaneous impulses acting in scene, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links: drone piques curiosity → scream → ink mark/message → grasp of "stolen and reshaped" time as CR closure with conceptual cost of world-altering pursuit. Orientation anchored early in mesa encampment post-eclipse; single scene tightens meaningfully at ink revelation narrowing to tracking thieves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like wind-etched grooves traced by fingers and dust kicked by boots grounds action; encampment as nomad waypoint subtly pressures via isolation/smuggler hub. Mesa edge and howling wind charge final image of resolve, mirroring internal shift; recurring wind constrains outdoor immediacy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracking unnatural escalates causally via message "They're taking the time," forcing lunge that saves child but crystallizes higher pursuit cost; agency in holding ephemeral ink forecloses disappearance path. One tightening suffices, with child's bluish tint and ragged gasps making stakes visceral before recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of time theft/bending emerges organically from eclipse tension, ink patterns as stolen time, reweighted in final realization tying to Elias' crisis perception; resonant CR avoids moralizing. Subtext in ink's human shape implies deeper world cracks without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (albino eyes "sharp as broken glass") filtering unnatural details; voice texture modulates from curious observation to compressed intensity at lunge. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("It started after the eclipse"); no head-hopping, rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pale fingers tracing the grooves... over centuries" advances setting/character); varied rhythm accelerates in crisis without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density like "liquid shadow" purposeful, no muddle in peak ink grasp; clean propulsion to charged final exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-ink theft via eclipse/drone in sci-fi wasteland transforms tropes through lived tracker choices; non-obvious CR revelation feels inevitable from prior unnatural pulls. Risk in surreal ink entity heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
