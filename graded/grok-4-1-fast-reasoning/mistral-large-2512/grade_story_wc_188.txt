<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices culminate in earned realization ("Not to defy hopelessness, but to remember it"), with contradictory impulses in her non-hero status versus bone-deep calling; interiority particular to fireworks designer avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("She understood then—this was why she had come"), cost legible in rag burning out and mission reconfiguration; orientation anchored early, one tightening at torch ignition reveals figures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming fortress petals of shadow/stone constrain revelation and charge final image ("fortress glowed like a lantern"); sensory details (damp earth, old smoke) purposeful and POV-filtered through fire designer's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bring light per note) signaled early, deepens via figures' emergence under Accumulative lens, forcing realization trade-off; agency in match-strike and spin forecloses defiance path with rag's felt exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory over defiance emerges organically from lighting action and figures; final image reweights note's call without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer in glowing fortress and pocketed mosaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in fire/light metaphors ("fire that danced, that laughed") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to hymn-deepening chant without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphor accumulation (blooming petals/shadows); varied rhythm propels to closure image, no loops or scaffolds dulling rag-spent moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks craft revealing shadow-etched memories in blooming fortress transforms light-bringer trope; risk in lyric Accumulative build inevitable in hindsight at figure revelation.</comment>
