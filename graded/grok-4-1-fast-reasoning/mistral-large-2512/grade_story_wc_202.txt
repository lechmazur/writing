<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to honor histories intensifies convincingly through embodied recognition of the fragment's hum against her skin; micro-choices like twitching fingers reveal values under pressure. Earned reconfiguration to ongoing search with felt cost of elusiveness. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragment acquisition to attic writing revelation, culminating in CR closure—"The searching was the honoring"—reweighting retrieval as present anchor with conceptual cost of elusiveness legible in final empty stall smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "salt and burnt sugar" and swaying bridges filter through Liora's priorities; lighthouse painting as micro-setting constrains tracing a map and charges final locket image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to honor/retrieve histories signaled early, deepens accumulatively in attic where stories' weight pulls lighthouse under, narrowing to intuition-anchor realization with felt cost of perpetual search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of elusively tangible histories emerges organically from fragment pulse, painting layers, and final barge: searching honors overlooked echoes, resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in mist/cracks/tangible imagery; rhythmic prose modulates dreamily in market to steady hum at end. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("You’re looking for the rest of it").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture ("time...pool, deep and still") fits accumulative mode; varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor density of metaphors in descriptive beats slightly risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lighthouse trope via intuition-anchor fragment in high-strung alchemist market; final empty stall painting recharges motif organically, risking bold lyric elusiveness without gimmick.</comment>
