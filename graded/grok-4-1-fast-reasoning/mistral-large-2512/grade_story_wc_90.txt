<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacifist endurance shines in unflinching responses to accusations ("I'm here now") and final surrender of ship, earning lighter solitude as cost of mercy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via stitching progression to CR closure ("the dimension groaned open... Euthymia drifted forward"), with legible cost in empty locket and dissolved ship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Faded photographs with tear-shimmers constrain progression and charge dissolution climax, filtering through Liora's tactile tracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to open dimension deepens accumulatively through accusing voices narrowing to her becoming "the wound," costing ship via agency in final press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final echoes ("child laughed... mother wept, but not in sorrow") non-literally reprice mercy's premise, reweighting regrets without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("needle of light, the thread pulled from Kwan Yin’s Tear") holds stable POV, rhythm modulating from quiet resolve to shuddering release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels without loops or muddle ("shadows peeled back like skin"), varying rhythm to peak in "gash of light."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stitching sorrows to dissolve regret-reliquary ship risks bold synthesis, transforming ghost vessel into pacifist catharsis with inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
