<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority in "silence was a living thing, coiled around her ribs," driving contradictory impulses (flinch at snap, then wade); final renunciation of full healing earned via feather's evolution into quill. Hairline slip in rationalized epiphany "healing wasn’t about mending" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening from feather to woven dawns to writing; CR closure lands cleanly in "The poem would never be finished... broken things could sing," reweighting premise with undeniable emotional cost of persistent grief. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring feather as micro-setting constrains choices (tucked in belt, becomes quill) and charges final image; selective sensory vividness ("iridescent as oil on water," water "not unkind") mirrors internal discord without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography (kneel to wade to reeds) coherent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs. beauty in incomplete) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening at dawns sighting that narrows to writing choice; cost legible in "grief was still there, but so was the feather." Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incomplete emerges organically through shifting images (frayed feather to woven dawns to unfinished poem); final line "even broken things could sing" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("sheet of hammered metal," "vanes catching the light like shattered stained glass") biases toward fractured beauty; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm passes read-aloud test; purposeful simile strings ("oil on water," "shattered stained glass") in opening build lyric texture without muddle. Minor overuse of "beauty" phrasing risks synonym churn but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms grief trope via "woven dawns" and feather-quill pivot, inevitable in hindsight; bold lyric risk-taking heightens resonance without gimmickry. No derivative echoes or hedging.</comment>
