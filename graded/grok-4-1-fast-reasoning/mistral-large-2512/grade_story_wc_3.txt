<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied emotion (heart aches, eyes stinging) and micro-choices (tracing cuneiform, pressing seed), with physics-vs-faith contradiction acting in scene; final translation earned by prior methodical buildup. Minor label-speak ("kindly methodical mind") slightly abstracts traits without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pulses, vibrations, script shifts builds to RR closure ("Not lost...Only changed") with felt emotional cost (eyes stinging) in final image. Orientation anchored early (arbor above clouds); single scene tightens via seed-planting trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (thrum of currents, bark warmth, misted breath) filters through Elara's priorities; arbor's fissure constrains seed choice, branches lifting charges final image. No generic placeholders; micro-setting (cuneiform) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reestablish connection via physics) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through guardian echo → seed plant → arbor response, narrowing to Charged Poise with agency (her exhale, notebook). Cost legible in ache and "never faded again" commitment; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition (physics/faith migration) emerges organically from seed analogy and script reconfiguration, reweighting premise in non-literal final image ("connection...never faded") without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (pattern-seeking via analogies); rhythmic prose modulates (short pulses in climax). No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, perceptual bias clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., arbor shiver to notebook); minor metaphor density in opener ("restless sea") purposeful but borders overwrite in buildup. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi arbor, cuneiform physics, seed vessel transforms tropes; risk in quiet CR closure ("Not lost") inevitable from methodical particulars, heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
