<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's interior contradiction between "cage of silk and shadow" doubt and "invitation" resolve acts in climb and touch; rebirth earned via marks pulsing to "hum in her bones" with integrative cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as light density builds from skin constellations to grotto stars bleeding brighter; CR closure in mirror part "like mist" reconfigures curse to memories with sky/earth conceptual cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt moss walls and liquid silver mirror constrain immersion, charge final "stars bled brighter"; firefly on wrist mirrors skin pulse, grounding ascent tactically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling marks tightens accumulatively to mirror agency; "weightless, suspended between two worlds" cost unmistakable, foreclosing disenchanted path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Last queen of the sky" and earth remembrance reweights invitation premise non-literally; final fireflies "like stitches" resonate without moral, embracing sky/earth complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with light-biased perceptual signature ("bleeding starlight," pulsing lines); rhythmic modulation accelerates to grotto without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("ozone and something older hummed in her throat"); zero loops, varied rhythm peaks at "grotto exhaled" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Liquid mirror as memory bridge transforms cosmic curse trope via textural light synthesis; risk in lyric ascent heightens rebirth stakes organically.</comment>
