<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—making herself small vs. bold theft of scrimshaw—and final embrace of visibility is earned through mother's revelation with embodied cost in lighter body. Interiority concrete via vibrations in bone and ribs. Flawlessly individual through dancer's grace under labor pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from docks to temple dissolution, culminating in Charged Poise closure where island vanishes but internal freedom crystallizes with scrimshaw's dust as conceptual cost. One tightening via map's vibration leading to shimmer. Orientation anchored early in Port Veyra docks; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring whalebone constrains choice (lock mechanism) and charges final dust image. Sensory vivid and selective: slick wood, biting ankles, whale hum mirroring internal shift. Black sand/coral temple evolves causally, filtering through Lirien's tactile priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via true nature) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to revelation narrowing violent pursuit, with agency in wading/following and cost in foreclosed fighting crystallized at "stop fighting what you are." Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of non-violent belonging emerges organically from particulars like scrimshaw map and whale pulse, reweighted in final walk where prior smallness inverts without moral state. Final image answers central question resonantly: freedom in release, not seizure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibrations/songs felt bodily; rhythmic prose modulates from coiled precision to dissolving sigh. Mother's dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Violence became impossible"). No head-hopping; diction biased to tactile sea-grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or image, no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short breach sentence amid flow), figurative purposeful (mirage island) without muddle in peak temple beat. Clean, vivid specificity trumps generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pirate scrimshaw transforms to mythic key for non-violent isle, synthesizing docks realism with whale-song fantasy in fresh arc of chosen detachment. Risky shimmer/dissolve turn inevitable from early vibration pattern. Bold tenderness heightens stakes organically.</comment>
