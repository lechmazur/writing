<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leeward's embodied interiority (vibrations in soles, hair, veins) roots motivation deeply; micro-choices like dubbing escalate to compel the climactic crack. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly undercuts peak agency, but endurance of prior listening pays off in earned reconfiguration. Strong voice-specific traits avoid stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dub to spinning raft and glowing fractals, with RR closure ("the world was singing back") legible via chest ache as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors immediately (raft edge, blue hour); one tightening (harder strike splits harmonics) suffices. No lens ambiguity or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood raft and brine fruit constrain choices (feet grip planks, trees lean as keys), charging final sky resonance. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight initially) reflects prophetic bias; blue hour evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sea collaboration via resonance) tightens accumulatively through pulses to explosive spin, narrowing passive prophecy into active mastery with embodied cost (breath hitches, chest aches). Agency drives escalation; no reversals needed, but felt price charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-to-instruments emerges organically via orchard proof and final "being heard," reweighting listening premise without moralizing. Fractal clouds shift meaning as resonant answer; ambiguity in sea's restlessness adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (fractal wind paths, salt veins); rhythmic prose modulates from sigh to wild laugh under pressure. No head-hopping or elision; diction fits prophetic idiom without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied openings, no loops); figurative language purposeful in buildup, coherent at peak crack without muddle. Minor overwriting in cloud descriptions doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet-musician on sea-raft transforms survival trope into euphonic collaboration; risk in fractal resonance pays off inevitably at glowing clouds. No derivative echoes; bold conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
