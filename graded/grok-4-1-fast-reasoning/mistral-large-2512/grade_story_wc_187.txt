<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between heeding elders' warnings and chasing shadows act in scene; final choice to pursue fog bridge earned by tactile chorus at third monument, with embodied cost in trembling fingers and deepening hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via monument sequence tightening density to CR closure; voices overlapping with her unsaid words at third monument reconfigure options, cost legible in "weight of all the things she had yet to live."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choices via murmurs responding to conjecture and touch, charging final "boots clicking" image; POV-filtered details like ink smells and shadow slants mirror identity quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging identity tightens accumulatively from shadow conjecture to pulse/chorus deepening; agency in kneeling, pressing, reaching forces trade-off, cost felt in mind-unraveling risk crystallized at no-shadow monument.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog bridge waiting "to walk it backward" offers resonant CR reweighting collective memory premise through particulars, without moral; ambiguity of echoes lingers as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with archivist's perceptual signature (meadow/thunder inks, fossil identity) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation deepens with hush, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythms propels hush-deepening; purposeful metaphors like "shadows absorbed it, bending it into shapes" integrate without muddle in peak chorus beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solid-fog bridge and no-shadow monument synthesize memory tropes into fresh CR pursuit; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
