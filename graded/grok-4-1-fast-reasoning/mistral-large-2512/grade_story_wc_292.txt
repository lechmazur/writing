<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor Elias drives micro-choices like pocketing the nail and decoding stanzas, with embodied dread ("breath hitched," "hands shook") contradicting initial "nervous confidence." Internal conflict emerges in shifting certainty, earned by revelations. Minor flaw: backstory summaries slightly dilute peak agency in furnace moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: journal discoveries build density to CR closure ("Exile is reversible, but so is the sky") reweighting premise with conceptual cost (Mira's required bravery amid storms). Orientation anchored early (cliffside station); causal linkages (codes → nail as key → passage) tighten without breaks. Cost legible in final alarms and groaning station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (mildew-ozone air, rattling gusts, furnace rumble) filter through Mira's deciphering bias, constraining choices (sliding nail into lock). Recurring station elements charge final image (groaning under "new sky"). Environment evolves causally with wind/storms, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Elias's truth) signaled early, deepens via journal revelations narrowing to action (open furnace), under Accumulative lens. Agency in questioning drives tightening; visible cost in storms pressing decision crystallized at end. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and reversible exile/sky emerges organically from codes, nail, journals; final line offers resonant CR without stating moral, reweighting ancestry as mission. Subtext in "ghost haunting" builds ambiguity around bravery's cost. Particulars (nail-key) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (poetic decoding: "lines were reversible"); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short sentences at "mechanism clicked"). No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to Mira's scholarly lens. Experimental poetic stanzas taught early, legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (long descriptive opens to punchy actions); metaphors purposeful ("jet stream twisting like a living thing") without muddle in peaks. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion peaks at furnace reveal. Read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coffin nail as literal/conceptual key transforms exile trope into sky-reversal premise, inevitable in hindsight via codes. Risky CR ending heightens stakes without gimmick; particular details (copper nail, flattened head) feel lived-in, non-derivative.</comment>
