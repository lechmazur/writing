<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies credibly from dreams to light-painting and photography, with micro-choices like borrowing the camera revealing values under pressure; final journey renunciation of full capture feels earned, though interiority leans poetic abstraction over embodied contradiction in early dream beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from palette discovery to photographic clarity, landing Charged Poise closure in final dialogue ("Not yet, but I will") with legible cost of perpetual longing reconfiguring capture; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly to island arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Luminous archipelago and salt-spray details constrain isolation-driven choices, with palette and camera as micro-settings charging final image; sensory hierarchy (light dominance) mirrors Elias's bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed paintings to photographic success narrowing options; agency in patient escalation culminates in journey with felt cost of persistence, though single deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of elusive longing emerges organically from light-cipher particulars, reweighted non-literally in final "not yet" image without moralizing; resonance from dream-to-photograph arc inextricable from protagonist's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with light-obsessed perceptual signature stable in third-limited POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You found me"), rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High figurative density purposeful for tone but borders overwrite in opening light metaphors ("liquid amber," "afterimage"); propulsion strong, minimal loops, though minor paraphrase in painting beats slightly dulls peak rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian painting dreams via light-to-photography transforms longing trope organically; risk-taking in abstract "vitalize" inciting non-causal turn heightens stakes toward charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
