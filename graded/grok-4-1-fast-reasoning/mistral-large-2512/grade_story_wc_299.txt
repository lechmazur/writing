<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in cloth-handling and fact-insulation; contradictory impulses act when Jake dismisses echoes despite sound expertise. Final emotional shift with Lena earned by prior micro-choices. Minor therapy-speak slip ("wrest from the jaws of failure") borders diagnostic without embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via echo/wind density, holds to Charged Poise closure where Lena's voice reconfigures past-isolation to future-possible, with felt cost in throat-tightening hesitation. Orientation anchored by ~100 words. One tightening via Lena's clarifying appearance breaks echo pattern without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry trailer/pit vividly selective (diesel-coffee, howling wind carrying "ghost applause"); recurring wind/echoes mirror internal state and constrain choice at pit edge. Cloth as micro-setting charges final image, narrowing perception to sound origins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cloth/pit progression to Lena encounter forcing stance crystallization. Agency in driving to pit forecloses isolation path with relational cost felt in brush of fingers. Escalation coherent under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of echoes (past applause to future voice) emerges organically from sound motifs shifting meaning; final image non-literally answers "remember what?" with reweighted uncertainty. Subtext in Lena's "confidently uncertain" lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sound-chasing bias); voice rhythmic, modulating from creaking isolation to charged poise. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Lena's cloth nod pursues reconnection); distinct idioms despite brevity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion; specifics replace generics (indigo grille weave). Minor paraphrase loop in early reflection ("facts didn’t betray... Facts were the difference") dings slightly, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie-to-appraiser via sound-haunted quarry transforms tropes; echo longing as purpose reweighting feels inevitable from particulars. Bold risk in quiet Charged Poise ending heightens emotional truth.</comment>
