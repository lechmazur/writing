<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's warmly inquisitive trait drives concrete micro-choices like angling the diary to light, revealing hierarchy of values with embodied tremble; internal conflict between curiosity and intrusion peaks in hesitation to leave, earning renunciation with felt heart ache. Captain's flicker to goggles and tender tracing show status dynamics without headcount bloat. Minor slip: brief backstory summary slightly abstracts emotional progression before captain's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from goggles trace to light-refracted sketches to captain's arrival, culminating in Charged Poise CR where Lira's palm on glass reconfigures intrusion's cost as "some secrets... not hers to unfold." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (servant in elevator, spire). One tightening via revelation forecloses path; cost legible in unclasped goggles and aching heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains via biting cold in slippers and elevator gears/chimes pressuring exit; frosted windows enable scattered light decode, charging final blurred haze image. Sensory hierarchy (engine oil scent, whiskey bottles) filters through Lira's flight-curious POV. Recurrent elevator/model airship mirrors ascent/grief without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfold secrets for joy beneath anguish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cipher resolution and captain confrontation narrowing to renunciation. Agency in light method and leaving items forecloses intrusion path with visible cost (goggles surrendered, captain turns away). Captain arrival complicates without resolving; moral calculus (sacred vs. curiosity) sharpens peak "what if joy...?" exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden joy beneath grief emerges organically from sketches/child's hand to Lira's question and captain's "risk tearing it all apart," resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in goggles scent/oil and diary breath implies buried love; ambiguity lingers in captain's tenderness vs. Lira's departure. Protagonist arc inextricable: curiosity confronts its limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (notices cook's shakes, captain's eyes) biases details character-specifically. Voice texture in rhythmic ascent ("elevator groaned... whirred below"); dialogue subtextual ("too curious... risk tearing") pursues goals. Brief captain intrusion clean, no leakage; compression at revelation fits pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "diary lay open, its pages shifting slightly as if breathing" advances atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm/read-aloud flow, no loops or scaffolds; specific verbs/nouns propel (lurched, hissed, clutched). Minor overwriting in "promise" and "shrine to flight" doesn't muddle closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cipher via scattered light on ice refracts grief revelation organically, transforming servant-curiosity trope into affectionate intrusion on captain's anguish. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens emotional specificity; no template echoes, voice commits to steampunk-lyric detachment.</comment>
