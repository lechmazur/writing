<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's observation and dawning understanding reveal patient alignment with Vey, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Vey's competence shines in key-sorting but shows minimal flaws or internal tension. Strong micro-choices like holding the arrow compel higher stakes. Earned endurance in moderation at vault feels credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: arrow signals puzzle, keys unlock progressively because scavengers recognize boundary, tremors force vault entry. Closure as Charged Poise in locking vault and stepping into dawn reconfigures from hiding to planting, with legible cost in "not too much" and future discovery risk ("They’ll find it eventually"). Orientation anchors instantly in prize center.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "stale popcorn and spilled soda," chain clinks, and Ferris wheel base constrain movement and charge final dawn exit. Carnival maze pressures choices during scavenger encounter; recurring rust/skeletal imagery evolves to contrast seed life. Sensory hierarchy fits Mira's peril-narrowed focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to claim vault tightens via scavenger standoff, narrowing options under causal pressure; Vey's arrow deterrence forces trade-off without fight. Tremors escalate as wall falls, charging vault moderation with future risk cost. Agency clear in decoding and non-hoarding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-planting emerges organically from seed jars and "not too much," answered non-literally in lighter chains stepping into dawn. Arrow message reweights hiding to growth without moralizing. Complexity in regime's hunger vs. scavengers lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Mira POV with distinct perceptual bias toward sounds (clinks ache teeth) and textures (raw wrists). Voice texture poetic yet grounded—"melody only the patiently strategic could hear"—modulates rhythmically. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in Vey's quiet warning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; sentences propel causally, e.g., "Vey plucked it free without a word, turning it in his fingers like a man reading a message." Zero figurative muddle, precise verbs anchor propulsion through peak tremors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc carnival vault with keys-as-melody map transforms tropes organically; arrow's fletching as boundary warding heightens stakes boldly. Patient decoding feels inevitable in hindsight, committing fully to strategic grace amid collapse.</comment>
