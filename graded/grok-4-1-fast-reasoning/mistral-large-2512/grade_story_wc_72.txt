<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Diver's hesitation before threading ampoule reveals contradictory impulses under unraveling certainty, earning the final realization with embodied cost (recoil, slow exhale). Statue's telepathy shows particular interiority via incisively kind precision. Backstory reflection anchors to present via ampoule but borders BRR limit without fully tilting micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: descent → telepathic sensing → revelation → instruction → ampoule threading → tendrils release → CR closure. Orientation anchored early (ruins, diver, statue). Ampoule shattering delivers on-page CR with conceptual cost in final violet shimmer and "weight of what it meant to truly understand."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fissure and silt-buried tree constrain pivotal threading choice and charge tendril emergence. Sensory selection (slick algae, murky water, violet seep) narrows to urgency, filtered via diver's deliberate movements. Final tendrils weaving ruins mirror internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover secret) tightens causally via prison revelation, narrowing triumph to monstrous release; agency in threading forecloses certainty with on-page recoil/cost. Escalation driven by diver's micro-choice under statue's guidance, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of certainty yielding to nuance emerges organically from cascading revelations and ampoule act, reweighting saviors as jailers in final "confession" image without moralizing. Diver's arc integrates via conflicted motivation, inviting ambiguity in tendrils' purposeful movement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited diver POV with clean telepathic intrusion (*italicized thoughts*); perceptual bias favors quest objects (ampoule, fissure). Voice texture modulates from serene indifference to charged realization, diction controlled (e.g., "incisively kind"). No head-hopping, inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action lines; rhythm varies (short diver reactions amid longer descriptions). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("frayed rope," "blood through veins") clusters pre-climax without obscuring tendril emergence. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue guarding monstrous bloom-prison transforms tropes via garden-as-confession premise. Risky CR closure via nuance embrace heightens stakes organically, inevitable from early vow/secret setup without retreat.</comment>
