<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Worry stone dent anchors Elias's resilience and exile motivation consistently, earning the final "Yes" endurance with embodied cost in palm press. Lysara's calloused hands and silence-translation reveal distinct traits under shared pressure. Minor flaw: internal conflict more summarized than simultaneous impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to symbols forming and CR realization of patience pact, with cost in foreclosed haste via "next phase" commitment. Orientation anchors immediately in nexus at dusk. Single scene coherent, closure cost legible in final image of pocketed stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus hum and swirling currents constrain observation choices, evolving tactilely to glowing stones charging climax symbols. Worry stone as micro-setting recurs to dent/palm in final image. Sensory hierarchy precise via Elias's pattern bias; twilight progression mirrors thematic unraveling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher covenant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Lysara's hum shifting currents to symbol revelation, narrowing to patience renunciation. Cost felt in exile reframed as meaningful wait. Lacks sharper trade-off before glow; pressure gentle, not agency-tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in difficult/silence emerges organically from glow symbols yielding patience pact, resonant CR in final stay amid fading light. Subtext in shared silence and worry stone reprise avoids statement. Final image reweights exile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of precise pattern-noticing; voice modulates poetically yet grounded. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("translating silence" guess), distinct idiolects. No head-hopping; rhythm breathes with hum escalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/action (currents "swirling like ink") advancing texture without loops. Varied rhythm propels to glow climax; no scaffolds or muddled metaphors. Minor overwriting in opening sky hues, but purposeful for dusk tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess tutor's precision meets silence-translation at magnetic nexus for patience CR, transforming exile trope via symbol chessboard. Risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; particular worry stone dent memorable.</comment>
