<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in expertise and stubbornness compels the activation choice with embodied tension (trembling fingers, steady breath). Voss applies relevant pressure via skepticism, shifting to awe. Internal consistency and micro-choices under doubt earn the hopeful endurance without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anomaly detection → generator plan → Voss interruption → button press causes static shift and campus change. On-page closure as Decisive Change with reconfiguration cost (ongoing wars). Orientation anchored immediately in station and role; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station booth, generator, tower constrain choices (embed signal via broadcast). Sensory hierarchy (static hum, fogged glass, creak) narrows under crisis; charts charge final image. POV bias filters cosmic patterns purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outmaneuver tricksters) signaled early, tightens via Voss doubt narrowing options to subtle pulse. Activation agency forecloses brute force with felt risk ("if wrong, lost"); cost legible in partial win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cunning whispers over chaos shouts emerges via signal vs. tricksters' jagged patterns. Final charts image reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in Voss arc avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmic pulses as warnings). Dialogue subtext-driven (Voss's falter reveals shift); rhythm modulates from tension to poise. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythms, no loops); metaphors coherent (static as revelation). Minor repetition ("cautiously hopeful") contained, not touching closure. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quasar tricksters countered by subsonic relic transforms sci-fi tropes via ingenuity. Risky subtlety premise commits fully, inevitable in activation payoff.</comment>
