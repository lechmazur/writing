<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory grief and hope embodied in chest pull and ritual coaxing; final endurance of partial loss earned via prior sensory buildup. Interiority particular to conjurer's fractal view of emotion. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choice to place eyes reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density tightens to orchard's exhale and glass eyes' glow, yielding Charged Poise CR of loss as "door left ajar." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in "not gone, not entirely" realization foreclosing full recovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stalactite drips, glowing fruit, mosaic stones constrain ritual choices and charge final dimming image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to fruit scent and earth pulse under ritual urgency. Details evolve causally with breeze and shadows; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map emotion via loss) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through eyes' roll to felt sister-presence, forcing acceptance trade-off. One deepening reweights options without reversal need. Agency in coaxing ritual; cost felt in ongoing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss theme emerges organically from mosaic cracks and glass-eye glow to resonant "question without an answer" CR. Final image recharges prior silence motif without moralizing. Complexity lingers in refusal of tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fractal emotion patterns). Rhythmic modulation builds to incantatory whispers; diction biased toward mathematical metaphors. No head-hopping or withheld facts; compression purposeful in lyric buildup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation in "sunlight through stained glass" simile coherent but borders purple in peak response beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes and emotion-fractals transforms loss trope into cavern ritual. Risky lyric Accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes. Bold conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
