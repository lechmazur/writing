<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to hush prophecy clear and intensifies through unfolding origami to release, earning quietude; interiority concrete in embodied acts like tracing earth and pressing wing, but leans abstract in "wound" realization without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from prophecy burden to release; on-page closure via pressing wing into brook (DC/RR) with legible conceptual cost of dissolved meaning and self-hushing, anchoring who/where/when early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook and damp earth as micro-setting constrain release choice and charge final image of wing's departure; sensory selection (murmuring waters, curling breath) purposeful and POV-biased toward silence, evolving with internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy signaled early, tightens accumulatively as mapping silence narrows to wing's dissolution; agency in deliberate press forecloses prophecy path with felt emotional cost crystallized in lingering echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of release into silence emerges organically from prophecy-as-wound to earned peace, reweighted by final image of walking away without looking back; resonant non-literal answer via crane's unburdened flow avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in silence-mapping and cosmic hum; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to serene, prose-as-character reflecting summoner's hushed mind without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates image/action; patterned repetition of "hush" and metaphors taught early as lyric mode pays off cohesively, but dense figuratives border overwriting in release beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami prophecy hush via silence-mapping transforms mystic trope through grounded brook release; final reconfiguration of shadow-to-light feels inevitable from particulars, with risk in abstract lyricism heightening stakes.</comment>
