<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's defiance roots in concrete traits like tracing ivory curves despite warnings, with embodied tremors under pressure; contradictory impulses (ritual duty vs. breaking silence) act simultaneously. Echo applies relevant pressure as foil. Minor abstract epiphany ("mend herself") edges from full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry density builds to CR closure where spire reveals her etched words, reweighting silence with "courage to speak" cost in final image. Anchors clear early; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint (echoes amplify words) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain poetry choice by amplifying/distorting words; mist and spire charge final image (parting reveals etchings). Sensory hierarchy (auditory dominance) fits urgency; details tactile and POV-biased (artistic lens).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract truth for ritual forgiveness) signaled early; accumulative deepening via poetry cadence shift forces stance crystallization at spire glow. Agency in speaking refracts options; cost legible in trembling hands and foreclosed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness demands voiced truth) emerges organically from refracted words and spire etchings; final image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in Echo's urgings layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artistic perceptual signature (warnings as "color on palette"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Echo's "You're forging it" advances pressure). Rhythmic modulation under stress; distinct voices (Lira terse, Echo playful).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; figurative language (e.g., "blade sharpened on whetstone") pattern-taught via poetry, no muddle in peak beats. Varied rhythm, no loops; minor density in opening metaphors contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic refraction in echo-canyon transforms forgiveness trope; bone spire etchings feel inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
