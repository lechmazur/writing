<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict peaks convincingly in the hesitation before plunging ("His own regrets coiled in his chest"), with contradictory impulses embodied in physical hesitation and final resolve, earning the closure choice through prior guilt cues; scavenger applies sharp relational pressure without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from hum detection to lighthouse amplification to key retrieval, delivering on-page DC closure ("The guilt didn’t vanish. It changed.") with legible cost in Elias's plunge and regret confrontation; orientation anchors crisply by para 2, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and resonator constrain pivotal choices (ice risks destabilization, lighthouse hum drowns signal), charging the climax plunge; sensory hierarchy (vibrational hum dominating) reflects Elias's expertise bias, with ice evolution mirroring stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect key) tightens causally via scavenger's matching and Elias's adaptive counter (lighthouse use foreclosing ice safety), with visible costs (shattered fork, blood, fall); no reversal overload, pressure coheres to agency-driven peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absolution as "learning to carry the weight" emerges organically from key's vibration shift and final exhale/image, reweighting guilt without statement; scavenger's awe provides counter-reading complexity, resonant non-literal close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibrational attunement focus); dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("You’re stealing"), distinct voices (Elias measured, scavenger rasped); rhythmic modulation under stress clean, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "boots splintering frost"); varied syntax propels causally without loops, overwrought similes ("old bones," "ghost in the cold") purposeful for ethereal tone but cap minor muddle at peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic guilt artifact and vibrational mechanics synthesize fresh absolution frame, transforming relic-trove trope via personal regret calculus; risk in quiet endurance close heightens inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
