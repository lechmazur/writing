<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in listening-over-noise belief drives switch and hesitation, with embodied listening ("felt it in her bones") and contradiction (wrong call forces pull). Blind spot in overtrusting sky whispers compounds to near-costly mistake, earning endurance. Final kneeling reveals hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens: switch enables control → listening misreads storm → crack forces pull (DC) with legible cost (near village loss). Orientation anchored early (Liora, sanctuary, role by para 1). Single scene tightens once meaningfully; closure reconfiguration (persists despite hubris) lands on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ozone, sharp air, rope fibers) filters through listener's bias, constraining choice (height sharpens whispers). Rope and flagstones charge final image (vibrations through bones). Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village safety via true read) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven misjudgment → lightning reversal narrowing options. Cost visible in pull after wrong call, charging poise. Situational pressure crystallizes stance under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (true listening vs. blind noise) emerges organically from switch, hesitation, and bell's toll reweighting hubris. Final image (bell vibrations via stones) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like microclimate notes ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (sky's "whispers," bone hums) stable, modulating rhythm with storm's rise. Prose texture poetic yet grounded in listener's idiom. No dialogue; elision of priests off-page purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short storm sentences), high density integrates setting/action. Minor paraphrase ("listened" purposeful motif); no loops or muddle in peak (crack → pull). Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: listener's quiet rebellion vs. institutional blare in high-altitude sanctuary transforms storm trope. Rope mend and wire switch feel organic, inevitable to hubris payoff. Risks lyric poise without gimmick.</comment>
