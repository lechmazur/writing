<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover family truth roots choices solidly from legacy to handle use; interiority concrete in fatigue-to-certainty shift. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during crank turns, leaning on poetic tells over embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from muse to successive revelations; CR closure lands on-page via "damning signature" reweighting erasure with conceptual cost of silenced voice. One tightening via specter warning suffices; orientation anchored early in archives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sepia room and warped bridge constrain choices—stepping triggers hum—while golden shadows filter POV and charge specter coalescence. Sensory hierarchy narrows to vibrations under crisis; recurring shadows evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through crank turns deepening from "fall" to "erasure"; agency in persistent turning forecloses book-path with felt warning cost. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges from particulars like rearranging pages; final Council reveal offers resonant CR reweighting "truth in words?" without moralizing. Subtext in specter's "bridges can be burned" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature on relics and shadows; poetic syntax modulates rhythmically with revelation intensity. Specter dialogue carries subtext advancing plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action; rhythm varies for ear. Opening's stacked metaphors ("exhaled... stretching like fingers") verge on overwrite, slightly dulling initial propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival magic via crank-tuned standing waves transforms haunted-library trope organically. Risky poetic conceit heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight from early handle pulse.</comment>
