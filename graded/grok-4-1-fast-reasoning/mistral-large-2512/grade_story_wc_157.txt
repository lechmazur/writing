<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's shift from amused retreat ("You’re late") to defiant commitment earned through Quill's targeted appeal to his past and the inspector's pressure, with embodied reactions like stiffening revealing internal conflict; Quill's charm drives persuasion without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Quill's plan → inspector interruption tightens stakes → Elias's map-grab as DC forecloses retreat with regime-detection cost legible in "insane" hesitation and hummed possibility; single scene oriented early, closure charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains via pollinating sequences and vines-as-runes, mirroring defiance and charging final "gardens are already talking"; sensory humidity/cicadas integrate purposefully through Elias's fogged lenses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recruit Elias for plant rebellion) tightens causally at inspector arrival, forcing agency in quick deflection and Elias's trade-off choice; cost felt in sagging relief and warped risk charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of subtle defiance emerges organically from garden patterns warping into messages, resonating in final "gourd rattled... only the defiant could hear" without statement; ambiguity lingers in regime oversight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Elias's work as invisibility cue); dialogue subtextual ("Traffic" evades, "harmless" deflects) distinguishes voices; rhythmic texture modulates from amused to charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (cicada drone to door hiss); no loops/artifacts, metaphors purposeful (symbols "alive"); propulsion peaks in inspector beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant semiotics in thought-tax dystopia transforms rebellion tropes via garden warping; risk in "candidly cryptic" communication heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
