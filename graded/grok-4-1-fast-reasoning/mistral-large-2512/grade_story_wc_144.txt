<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's blind competence shines through embodied actions like tracing the drone's wing and feeling vibrations, rooting motivation in sensory trust; Mara adds relational pressure via her question and tool handoff. Internal endurance of uncertainty earns the release without deep contradiction. Minor idealization flattens potential flaws, but micro-choices reveal values under the ship's departure pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repair details build density to the release and return, culminating in Charged Poise RR where feedback clarifies as "direction" with trust cost felt in the calm success. Orientation anchors instantly in depot/mist. Single scene causality links past flight data to on-page flight test via water refraction cue. No slips touch closure image of drone's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water basin constrains drone balance test and charges final calm, with mist/depot refracting blind POV via sound/touch/smell hierarchies. Sensory selectivity mirrors urgency, narrowing to ripples and hum amid ship groan. Micro-setting (basin, tools) guides choices without tourism. Recurring mist evolves from curling threat to settling poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode erratic feedback before ship leaves) signaled early, tightens via release amid rising anchor rhythm, narrowing to endurance of non-visual trust. Agency in precise adjustments forecloses failure path with implied risk cost. Accumulative cadence shift reweights via return pulse matching ship. Stakes viscerally felt in held breath and fading hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of non-visual insight emerges organically from sensory repairs to final line "Some things don’t need eyes to be seen," reweighting premise via drone reprise without statement. Subtext in Mara's awe and Elias's smile layers ambiguity of "sending it home." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Final image answers trust question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited Elias POV stable with blind perceptual signature (ripples bend glow, vibrations as heartbeat). Voice rhythmic, modulating calm intensity; dialogue subtextual ("You’re sending it home") pursues goals. Diction sensory-biased, no leakage. Prose syntax reflects tactile mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers stilled on the drone’s wing" advances action/emotion); rhythm varies with short hum sentences building to release. No loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors; figurative language sparse/precise (wings like stained glass). Clean propulsion to closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan decoding drone via water refraction transforms sight trope into sensory triumph. Ingenuity in feedback-as-anchor rhythm link feels inevitable from vibrations cue. Risks calm tone amid departure stakes without gimmick. No derivatives; premise commits to haptic world logic.</comment>
