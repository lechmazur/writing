<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength in embodied spatial perception and micro-choices like laser on spore; weakness in internal conflict remaining abstract without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with tightening via spore vial reveal; Charged Poise closure legible in final pulse with conceptual cost of reconfigured boundaries, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow and damp earth vividly constrain choices and charge final image ("the entire farm pulsed in unison"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boundaries/letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Mara's reveal narrowing isolation; cost felt in "now, we let go" without agency overreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as doors emerges organically from spore/light images; resonant non-literal answer in final flare reweights "familiar strangers" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (spatial/light obsession); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, rhythm modulates purposefully to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, no loops; minor figurative density ("quiet wildfire") pattern-taught early without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mycology/science in "spores in your path" literalizes familiar strangers; risk-taking in poetic tone heightens stakes organically.</comment>
