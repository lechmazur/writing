<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in father's legacy intensifies credibly to final choice; interiority concrete via shaking hands on microdot photo. Contradictory impulses (initial laugh at note vs. compulsion) act in scene, earning decision with relational cost of embracing secrecy. Woman's arrival forces micro-choice revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: note slip cues search "where the light bends," yielding envelope/microdot, prompting woman's arrival and decision. Closure as Charged Poise in "Then let’s play it" reconfigures Elias's role with felt cost of orchestrated inheritance. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via boat engine sound suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam "where the light bends" constrains discovery under loose stone, charging final image of beam turning "darkness into something navigable." Sensory details (oars dipping black water, wind whipping) selective via Elias's priorities. Spatial choreography coherent in spiral stairs climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover father's secrets) signaled via initial slip, tightens causally at microdot photo revealing "retirement" lie, then woman's demand. Agency in search and "let’s play it" forecloses isolation path with cost in stomach drop and life transposition. Pressure coheres under causal lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges via cookies as dead-drops, light refraction hiding truths; final lighthouse beam image recharges as non-literal answer to transposing chaos. Resonance from particulars like grease smudge/"Transpose," avoiding morals. Protagonist arc inextricable from "open secrets" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (traces walls for bent light). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("The past is a melody waiting to be replayed"); distinct voices in terse exchange. Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "beam cutting through the fog like a metronome" advance atmosphere/foreshadow. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; syntax propels from reflective setup to peak boat arrival. Clean mechanics, purposeful telling in backstory anchors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune cookies as spy drops transposed to lighthouse microdot orchestration feels inevitable via "open secrets" frame. Tropes (missing keeper, cryptic notes) transformed through spycraft specificity; risk in quiet closure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
