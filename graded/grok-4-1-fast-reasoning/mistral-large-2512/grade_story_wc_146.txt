<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Infinitely patient endurance shown in day-by-day matching of phantom strides earns departure with implied ongoing cost; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echoes densify from faint click-click to golden shimmer RR closure; patient progression reconfigures town as listening with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archway fulcrum and shivering cobblestones constrain tuning process and charge final shimmer image; sound hierarchy reflects tuner's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant resonance stake tightens accumulatively via paced footsteps matching growing echoes; endurance forecloses rushed options with visible seven-day cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final shimmer reweights rebuilding premise as danced rhythm restoring heartbeat, not walls; emerges organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic syntax and sound-biased perception create distinct perceptual signature matching theme; stable close third-person holds under patient pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels hush to shimmer without loops or muddled metaphors; high density integrates sensory detail into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuning-fork physics reviving ghost echoes via footsteps transforms tropes; inevitable in hindsight from early resonance premise.</comment>
