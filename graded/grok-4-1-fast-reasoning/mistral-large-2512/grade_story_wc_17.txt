<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots clearly in father's obsession, embodied via diary handling and hesitant reach at closure. Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; woman underdeveloped as pressure source. Final endurance of legacy feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density to Charged Poise closure where map reconfigures legacy as warning with felt burden cost ("Legacy’s burden settled over him like a shroud"). Orientation anchored early (passage, Elias's quest post-floods). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and humming walls constrain choices (ducking tendrils, feeling vibrations) and charge final image (symbols pulsing, map veins). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (explorer notices warmth, ozone). Atmosphere tensions mystery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel father's wall-secrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via film negative and shadow glimpse narrowing to map confrontation. Protagonist agency in pushing door yields woman/map escalation. Cost legible in anticipatory hum foreclosing ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of remembering walls vs. forgotten legacy emerges organically from discoveries, reweighted in woman's reveal and hovering hand without moralizing. Final image offers resonant CR on survival amid climate ruin. Subtext in gaps (burned diaries) invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing whispers, ivy tremble). Voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating to terse dialogue ("You’re late"). No head-hopping; woman's lines goal-driven, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive with varied syntax; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("veins of a forgotten god") doesn't obscure. No loops, high density in discovery beats. Clean mechanics support momentum to humming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient architecture and climate-surviving legacy via film negative/map veins transforms tropes. Risky quiet ending crystallizes ingenuity without gimmickry. Irreplaceable wall-dreaming premise commits fully.</comment>
