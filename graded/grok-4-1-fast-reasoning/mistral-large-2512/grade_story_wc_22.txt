<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied listening ("the creak of the jetty, the sigh of the tide") and micro-choices like nodding to the heron before scattering seeds. Motivation to reclaim roots in consistent traits (seed-gathering over years), compelling the ritual with felt endurance cost (lighter pods, heavier heart). Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from environmental whispers to heron interaction tightening to Charged Poise closure ("The blooming jetty would remember"). Orientation anchored early (Elias on jetty at twilight). One meaningful deepening via heron scatters seeds with conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jetty's weathered wood and cracks constrain seed placement, charging final groan reply. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt, damp earth via "dead languages"); details evolve causally (twilight bleeding sky/water). Environment shapes ritual choice and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim lost life) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via heron question/invitation forcing scatter agency. Cost felt on-page ("his heart was not" lighter). Pressure coheres without reversal need; heron deepens without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of decay/renewal emerges organically from particulars (reef death to seeds in battlefield cracks). Final image reweights patiently stubborn earth without moralizing. Resonance from images like "vastness so narrow it felt like a wound" avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature ("spoke dead languages... in the silence between things"). Stable close third-person POV; rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged ("The jetty groaned again, softer this time"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short declarative finals charge closure); high density integrates image/action. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("sky bleeding into the water") purposeful for voice, not muddling peak scatter beat. No loops; propulsion builds to patient earth image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coachman decoding nature's dead languages to seed battlefield ghosts transforms renewal trope. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight; "fertilize the idea of return" non-obvious angle heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
