<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between collecting hopes and letting them go act in scene via wading deeper despite resistance, reaching for dissolving protagonist, and final turn back; earned by accumulating cameos with embodied cost (edges digging palm). Interiority particular via literary lens (ink resisting, half-formed sentences). Final renunciation forecloses completion path with felt novel-haunting cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cameo density increases pattern, protagonist appearance breaks it into CR closure ("let them pass through him") with undeniable conceptual cost in foreclosed hopes/novel. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (feral nexus, river bend). No shards; single scene coherent to charged poise image of turning against current.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, river current, silt constrain choices (wading deeper, expulsion pull) and charge final image (mist always there). Sensory selective/POV-biased (damp earth/old paper for novelist; swirling patterns like sentences). Details evolve causally (mist thickens post-protagonist), mirroring internal without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect hopes to finish novel) signaled early, tightens via protagonist cameo reversal narrowing options to renunciation. Accumulative escalation: cameo density + current insistence reweights with legible cost (dissolving figure, pulling harder). Agency in turning back crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (hope's fragility: shape then release) emerges organically from cameos/shell/protagonist, reweighted in CR final image ("keep watching") without moralizing. Subtext in implications (boy's falling face, accusation "you never let me be"); invites ambiguity on completion vs. process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (watchful literary noticing: pages turning, ink in water). Rhythm modulates (short questions in dialogue, elongating realizations). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You never let me be anything more than a sketch" reveals flaw).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion (e.g., "mist thickened, the river’s current pulling harder"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors coherent/patterned (mist living/page-turning). Closure image undistorted ("wading back toward the shore, the whisper... louder").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: liminal nexus leaks fictional characters as hopes for novelist's shell-tied novel; transforms surreal tropes via accumulative cameos into CR on art/hope. Risky surrealism heightens stakes coherently (+0.3). Irreplaceable cameo-protagonist turn inevitable from setup.</comment>
