<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict in "gap between knowing and understanding" as prison, embodied in hitched breath and bow adjustment; final leap earned by intensifying motivation to seize beauty. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak agency without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell pulse → rhythm mimicry → wild music → leap; CR closure in "she was free" reconfigures options with cost of ongoing statues/resistance legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal leap from sky-bridge and charges final image of child at cracked speaker; sensory selectivity (oil/decay, speaker crackle) mirrors stakes. Orchard statues evolve causally with vines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (play vs. escape) tightens via shell-enabled rhythm change narrowing options; agency in vaulting forecloses orchard path with jarring landing cost. Escalation causal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of seizing beauty emerges via orchard failure to mechanical stirring; final "music began anew" non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing, cost in resistance ahead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (music as hum/lullaby); rhythmic diction modulates from soft to wild effectively. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("You're real").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (shattered prism shell). Minor simile density in opening but no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin rhythm vs. statues/shell heartbeat transforms stasis trope; risk in leap/ongoing fight inevitable from particulars.</comment>
