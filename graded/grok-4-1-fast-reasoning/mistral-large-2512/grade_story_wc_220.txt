<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to bridge distance to the dead is concretely rooted in traits like trembling hands and past failures, culminating in an earned renunciation of escape; internal conflict layers via ghosts pulling closer despite flight, shown in embodied hesitation before packing courage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered revelations (riddle to cylinder to message) tightening to Charged Poise closure—he packs and commits to the dark—with legible emotional cost in "last of his courage"; orientation anchors early in scrapyard truck, no debt; one meaningful deepening via Liora's voice suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard and truck constrain isolation and cue discoveries (oil drum hiding cylinder); leaf pulses to mirror internal cracks, charging final pack; sensory hierarchy (wind's voices, wax scent) filters via bloodhound's post-war bias, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer the call from the dead/changed) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via riddle-cylinder revelation narrowing retreat option; agency in search and final decision forecloses flight with felt courage cost; no reversals needed, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of tinted truths emerges via warped voice, pulsing leaf shifting from memory to imperative; final image reweights escape as lie without moralizing, resonant via conflicted closeness; no tidy resolution, ambiguity in "change them" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (corpse-like similes, scent-perfume of decay) biased to bloodhound senses; rhythmic modulation builds hush to chill, compression taught early pays off in warped chorus; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "needle hissed to life" advances plot/sound/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (rattling breath/phonograph) without muddle, propelling to taut closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound trope with phonograph secrets and underground war twist transforms post-apoc into introspective quest; risk in lyric reflection pays off via charged poise; irreplaceable leaf-cylinder linkage feels organic, not templated.</comment>
