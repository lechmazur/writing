<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices under pressure (picking lock, sending evidence despite trembling hands) reveal hierarchy of values, earning the final confrontation; interiority concrete via grandmother's voice cueing present action. Minor flaw: emotions occasionally label-like ("stomach twisted") without deeper embodiment in pivotal overhear beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lantern guides to sound-reverberated door, overhear narrows options to act, closure as Charged Poise in reignited lantern step-forward with risk cost legible ("not on his terms"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by ~100 words; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp/rust/ozone specificity filters via Elias's professional eye, constraining stealth (crouch behind crates); lantern as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis, mirroring internal pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Voss) signaled early via suspicion, tightens causally at overhear ("destruction"), agency in phone evidence forecloses escape with exposure cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lantern motif shifts from escape to guidance, recharging Underground Railroad parallel in final image without statement; theme of light exposing corruption emerges organically from particulars, inviting ambiguity on war's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (traces engravings professionally); voice texture modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences at sound). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Voss snippet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Density high with multi-job lines (e.g., smell clings post-shift advances backstory economically); minor template cadence in flicker/light recurrences purposeful for motif, no closure dulling. Rhythm varies, but occasional hedge ("suddenly felt heavier").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Investigator heirloom turning Underground Railroad relic against modern corruption transforms tropes organically; fresh synthesis in empirical pattern-to-conspiracy arc risks bold confrontation poise.</comment>
