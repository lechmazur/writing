<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in the "paradox of the destitute philanthropist" and micro-choices like clutching the jar reveal values under pressure, earning the final shift to feeling "necessary"; woman as secondary pressure forces pivotal recognition without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from bug flicker to mirror vision to eruption; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "He ran... He had a village to save," reconfiguring options with the volcano's "first cough of ash" as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand, volcano tremors, and tides constrain the detour and final run while charging the mirror moment; sensory hierarchy narrows to "humming... whispering hush" under rising urgency, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrated kindness tightens via prophecy reveal and mirror, forcing stance crystallization in the run; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift from stillness to eruption narrows options with legible eruption cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of accidental necessity emerges organically from bug-to-darkness arc and "orchestrated coincidences," reweighted in final "necessary" realization without statement; resonant non-literal answer in ash-painted sky avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in light-obsessed noticing (bug as "dying star"); dialogue subtext-heavy ("You’re the one they call the Stormbringer") advances goal; rhythm modulates from hush to eruption propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "The bottled lightning bug collection was his last secret, his quiet rebellion"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("sleeping giant," "billowing like smoke") dulls one high-pressure beat but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bug-jar rebellion and accidental prophecy transforms destitute trope; risk in "texture of transformation" line heightens stakes via CR without gimmick, feeling inevitable in mirror-to-run arc.</comment>
