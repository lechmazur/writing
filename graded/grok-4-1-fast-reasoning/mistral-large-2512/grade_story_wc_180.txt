<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's persistence motive compels mending micro-choice under girl's pressure; embodied via chest tightening and ribbon-twisting. Interiority concrete but lacks sharp contradictory impulses in peak reveal. Final endurance earned with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via deepening images to Charged Poise closure; pendant repair and peach exchange reconfigure persistence with scarred cost legible in "cracks can hold something new."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard-cathedral constrains mending site and mirrors vows; bees' hum and peach warmth charge final bite, with POV-biased sensory narrowing to pollen-dusted immediacies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of persistence tightens texturally via shared ribbon revelation; agency in repair forecloses unhealed path, cost felt in girl's faltered voice and scarred hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deciduous vows theme emerges via trees and repair, reweighted non-literally in peach juice and growth realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with orchard-infused perceptual bias; dialogue subtextual ("Why do you still have hers?") pursues goals, distinguishing voices via girl's directness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion via varied syntax matches scene cadence; minor opening figurative density ("skeletal rafters heavy with peach blossoms") but no closure artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cathedral-orchard and quartz mender synthesize fresh persistence frame; "deciduous vows" transforms loss tropes inevitably via scarred repair.</comment>
