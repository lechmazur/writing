<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's particular attunement to "creeping normality" drives consistent micro-choices like crouching on the dock and slipping the shard under the door, revealing character through embodied noticing. Interiority concrete and bias-specific, avoiding stock phrases. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; realization feels earned but smoother than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from bay's silent tide to house pause, landing Conceptual Repricing closure in "the shape of a sound, the ghost of a breath held too long" with conceptual cost of houses' self-listening. Orientation anchored early (bay, spring, Elias). Lens holds cleanly; constraint of warped door shapes final tactic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "seaweed sway" and "clapboard... leaned toward him" filter through Elias's perceptual bias, constraining choice via warped door gap for shard. Setting evolves causally (house stops, then exhales), charging final image of resuming house against patient bay. Micro-setting (shard, door) indispensable to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to confront living houses via shard signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pause that "narrow[s] options" to revelation, with agency in shard displacement foreclosing naive sanctification. Cost legible in house's heavier resumption and Elias's averted gaze. Single tightening sufficient; enters high band via felt price on final exhale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-listening structures emerges organically from particulars like breathing houses and paused rhythm, reweighted non-literally in realization "They were listening to themselves." Final image of resuming house answers central question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling") biases noticing toward silences and shadows. Rhythmic prose modulates from patient lapping to pulse-loud tension, purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "the silence felt deliberate, as if the bay had decided... to stop pretending" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies naturally, passing read-aloud test. Minor dense metaphors (e.g., streetlights "daydreamed") purposeful without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing houses that "listen to themselves" via orris shard transforms haunted-house trope through textural accumulation and conceptual hush. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes via Elias's walk-on without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight from early creeping normality seed.</comment>
