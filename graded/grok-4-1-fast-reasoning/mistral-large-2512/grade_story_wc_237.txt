<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in trembling dip versus deliberate hardening of ink; final transformation of scars earned via micro-choices under grief's pressure. Mother's memory anchors without flattening present agency. No unearned epiphanies; embodied burn of rune tracing seals change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ink shards to glowing rune reconfigures failure into voice. Orientation anchored in opening lines (platform, quill). Closure as CR/Charged Poise lands with cost in "storms would return" and free-flowing ink.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss-covered platform and crystallized ink constrain choices (precarious balance, air-hardening), charging final rune image. Sensory hush (wind's absence pressing ears) mirrors internal stasis. POV bias filters vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewrite grief via runes) tightens accumulatively when shards form alive rune, narrowing dismissal of old ways. Agency in deliberate dip forecloses perfection path; cost legible in memory-burn and imperfect-but-true rune.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories rewriting pain emerges organically via quill memory and scar-tracing; final image reweights scars as "stories now" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (e.g., ink as "black snow") biases toward rune-scholar priorities. Rhythmic modulation builds to exhale cadence; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line integrates action, image, reflection. Varied syntax, no loops; figurative "black snow" purposeful, not muddled in peak (shard-to-rune).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink-stress crystallization enabling living rune from grief transforms rune-magic trope. Lyric risk in hush-build to smile-with-raindrop heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
