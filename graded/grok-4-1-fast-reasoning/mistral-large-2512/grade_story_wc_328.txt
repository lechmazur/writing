<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in final smile ("bitter and bright") earning metamorphosis choice; embodied glow in veins and refusal of Maren's warning show flawed embrace of dark under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to on-page DC closure ("He metamorphosed") reconfiguring rules; translucent fingers provide legible cost, orientation anchored early in garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing foxfire and humming air constrain choices (e.g., kneeling, phone pickup) and charge final hum/image; sensory selectivity (damp earth, mint) mirrors POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive threshold) signaled early via arrowhead warmth, tightens accumulatively through phone visions to physical transparency cost; agency in persistent listening forces crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "harmony untamed" emerges organically from bending air/images to final reconfiguration without statement; resonant punchline smile reweights bitterness premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "air bends," "rules... sang") biases to cryptid lens; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("That’s not from here"), rhythmic control peaks in static roar.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., static-to-voices cadence); minor metaphor density ("scent... promise," "shadows chasing") coherent but borders overwriting in opening without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic/phone/garden threshold into inevitable metamorphosis; risk in cosmic joke pivot transforms tropes, heightening stakes via rule-rewrite without gimmick.</comment>
