<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like jealousy "coiling in his gut" and "feral nostalgia gnawed at him," compelling micro-choices such as clutching the scroll instead of burning it. Flaws like resenting past selves drive inevitable struggle without safety-hedging. Final poise at the door feels earned by prior causal buildup of time competition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scrolls, dreams, and reflections builds to Charged Poise RR at "The latch clicked. The door swung open," reconfiguring time-stake with conceptual cost of inescapable cycle. Orientation anchors early in cabin/scroll; one tightening from internal ache to external intrusion. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "ink had bled... words swimming" and "taste of iron and pine" filter through Elias's chronicler bias, mirroring internal chaos. Recurring scrolls/cabin walls constrain choices (collecting, clutching) and charge final intrusion. Spatial choreography coherent; mountain "teeth" evolves with wind pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos amid time rivalry) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dream fragments to deliberate "something moved... aware," narrowing to door poise with felt cost of jealousy/ache. Agency in enduring scroll/not burning forecloses escape. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia and self-jealousy emerge organically from particulars like own-hand scroll and predated grave, culminating in resonant final image questioning intruder as "past self... or future." Ambiguity lingers without moralizing; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: chronicler-poetic noticing ("logs groaning like an old man"). Rhythmic modulation builds tension; purposeful compression in reflections taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative language like "mountain’s teeth" coherent and voice-motivated, accelerating to crisp final beats. No loops, scaffolds, or metaphor muddle; propulsion clear in wind-to-door cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-loop premise via jealous past selves and "chronologically confused" grave transforms tropes; bold poetic risks heighten stakes without gimmickry. Final door reweighting feels inevitable from scroll quote.</comment>
