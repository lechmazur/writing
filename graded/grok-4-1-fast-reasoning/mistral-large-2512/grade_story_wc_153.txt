<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—fear silences but pressure compels speaking "I was afraid"—earning the final renunciation of silence with felt emotional cost; interiority concrete via embodied regret (throat tightens, scar softens); apparition forces crucible choice without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spirits' song and condensation messages build density to Charged Poise closure when Liora speaks into air and shard glows, reconfiguring regret with legible cost ("still don't know how"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; no causality breaks, one tightening via apparition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, boardwalk slickness, moonlight canopy constrain shard-pressing choice and charge final sighing roots image; sensory hierarchy (song like silk, brackish water) reflects Liora's regret-filtered urgency; no generic placeholders, details evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find pre-decision moment) signaled early, tightens via apparition confrontation and spirits' swell forcing spoken admission; agency in pressing shard/speaking forecloses silence with emotional cost; lens escalation via density reweights to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of regret's reflection emerges via unsent letter particulars shifting to spoken "Try" and "first step" image, offering non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in apparition's sad smile and cool touch lingers ambiguity; resonance recharges shard/scar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (humid dark fragile as dawn); voice rhythmic, diction sensory-biased; apparition dialogue subtextual ("You still don't"), goal-driven; no head-hopping, elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring pressure (short breaths in dialogue beats); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (roots as drowning fingers pay off in sigh); closure image clear, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gargoyle shard healing regret in spirit mangroves transforms supernatural trope via textural buildup to "first step" reconfiguration; risk in lyric fierceness heightens stakes organically; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight.</comment>
