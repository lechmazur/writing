<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hesitation at the black thread embodies contradictory impulses of silence versus voice, earning the final renunciation of fear with visible emotional cost in lighter steps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory-tracing builds density to Conceptual Repricing closure; "She had unlocked more than a door" reconfigures fear with conceptual cost of broken silence, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Threads as micro-setting constrain unlocking choice via tactile tracing; courtyard snow mirrors internal thaw, evolving from blanket to mirror in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defiance tightens accumulatively through thread-deepening, hesitation at black serpent foreclosing silence with felt bone-vibration cost; minor abstractness in initial lullaby softens peak charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Threads shift from chains/love/silence to thematic defiance, final "conformity... broken by those who refused to be still" resonates non-literally via gathered echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "breath curling" and "bodily poetic grace" biases toward embodied defiance; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (threads pulsing alive) propels via varied rhythm; minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrit but pays off in closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste temple-body harvesting silenced voices via memory-threads transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking lyric mode inevitable in hindsight, heightening defiance stakes.</comment>
