<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied traits (Elias feels music via vibrations; Mira's twitching fingers reveal numbness); arc earned through micro-choices like signing frustration then closing eyes to embrace hush. Minor therapy-speak in Mira's "hollow ache" summary slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure ("numbness didn’t disappear—it changed") with legible cost in "didn’t flinch away from the emptiness"; single scene coherent, orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cavern's sound-absorbing stone constrains hearing-based music, enabling vibration "thrum... through the stone"; drum skin and needle as micro-settings charge final tap image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness vs. hush embrace) signaled early, textural escalation via needle-to-drum pivot narrows to bone-deep realization; cost felt in shaky breath and unflinching void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence as emotion's space) emerges via particulars like drum's "space between beats"; final image reweights premise without moralizing, numbness reconfigured non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with vibration-biased perception; rhythmic prose ("faintest vibrations hum through stone") modulates tension; signed dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful hush repetition; minor scaffold in repeated "hush/silence" coils slightly dulls one mid-beat without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, broken needle, hush-as-music transforms silence trope; risk of abstract "filament" pays off in tactile drum closure.</comment>
