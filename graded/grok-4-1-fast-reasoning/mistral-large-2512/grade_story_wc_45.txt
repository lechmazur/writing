<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's forgiving skeptic nature drives contradictory impulses—doubting yet performing the ritual—culminating in an earned embrace of the child with relational cost. Interiority particular via "forgiving skeptic" shown in staying post-body and whispering unknown words. Final micro-choice to take the tooth reveals values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: teeth discoveries build density to map and child encounter, yielding Charged Poise closure where garden "sighs" reconfigures fear into wholeness with conceptual cost of town's ignorance. Orientation anchored early in garden post-body. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "constellations... seen only by those who knew where to look."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's damp earth, unnamed flower colors, and humming air constrain choices (digging roots, maze paths) and charge final image of sighing release. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lena's priorities under uncertainty. Micro-setting via teeth as recurring object enables ritual and map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to heal town's "festered" fear via changeling truth tightens accumulatively: baby tooth → second tooth/ritual → map → child, narrowing doubt to acceptance. Agency in kneeling/ritual/following forecloses running path. Felt cost in embracing "strangeness" charges ending under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiving strangeness emerges via teeth ritual and garden's "What if?" bending rules, resonating in final walkback image reweighting fear as private "constellations." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in town's unawareness. Protagonist arc inextricable from making "mistakes into constellations."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: skeptic filters yield "cleft in certainty" diction. Rhythmic control modulates from reflective to humming urgency. Child's dialogue subtextual ("you do") advances closure without declaration; distinct from Lena's internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (teeth "glowing like a star trapped in enamel"); metaphors coherent and purposeful (rules "bent like willow branches"). Varied syntax propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds dulling peak ritual/map reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms changeling folklore via teeth-as-map ritual and skeptic's bone-setting into mythic innovation. Risky Accumulative closure via garden sigh heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like pulsing silver map feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
