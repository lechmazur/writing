<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as beautician-mortician integrates backstory concretely into present ritual ("most profound beauty lay in the quiet moments before the end"), with embodied relief ("breath shaky with relief") and aching heart revealing values under pressure. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via ritual beats to Charged Poise closure ("eyes opened... reflecting the sky’s glow"; chip darkens as temporary cost felt). Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto's ice constrains ("sharp as the ice beneath her boots") and charges final image ("shadow stretching long across the ice"); aurora evolves causally ("rippled... deepening... flared"), mirroring internal states through selective POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve spark) signaled para 3, tightens accumulatively via twitch/breath/eyes with agency in infusion; cost legible ("won’t last—the spark would fade again"). Entry to high band via option narrowed to temporary defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty/death as companions emerges organically from particulars (frost patterns, aurora mourning), resonant non-literal answer in final image ("threshold of stillness had held... she would return") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature ("tracing patterns in the static of existence"); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual ("hummed... singing a low, wordless melody"); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("pressed it to the figure’s lips, whispering words older than the grotto itself"); figurative density purposeful in lyric mode without muddle, but minor paraphrase in aurora riffs ("rippled... deepening... flared") docks slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beautician-mortician at skyborne threshold transforms death tropes via specific ritual/spark capture; risk-taking in lyric stasis heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight with no derivative echoes.</comment>
