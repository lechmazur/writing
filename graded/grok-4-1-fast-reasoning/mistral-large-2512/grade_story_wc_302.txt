<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in scholar's habit of documenting, compelling micro-choices like tracing symbols and reading the letter aloud; interiority concrete via hesitation before watch reveal. Final unveiling earned through cumulative participation demanded by library. Minor archetype feel in "veiled dreamer" doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via pulsing shelves and mist ripples, holds to CR closure: "She understood now... the unspoken was... waiting," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of sealed fate in empty room. Orientation anchored by para 2; single surreal scene tightens via book-with-letter forcing participation. Watch's chime as decisive cadence shift shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and pulsing books constrain choices—aisles vanish on hesitation, whispers propagate paths—charging final fade; watch as micro-setting handled tactilely, stills at midnight. Sensory selective (parchment/electric hum) mirrors dreamer's perceptual bias. No white-room; coherent surreal geography evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken library) signaled para 4, deepens accumulatively via cipher-watch-voice interactions narrowing to letter-reading/penning, forcing trade-off of unveiling with library's loss. Agency in aloud reading alters options; cost felt in mist-thickening and fade. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken as process emerges via cipher/symbols/delays, reweighted non-literally in "propagation delays of memory and desire" realization without moralizing. Final watch-at-midnight image resonates, embracing ambiguity of freedom's cost. Organic from particulars, no thesis echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited with perceptual signature in symbol-noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from "cautious exuberance" to trembling voice, consistent under surreal pressure. Voice murmur natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; elision of cipher mechanics taught early, legible at click.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands moved backward, then forward... counted the moments between knowing and unknowing"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/scaffolds/muddled metaphors in peak book-reveal beat. Minor overwriting in symbol descriptions purposeful/consistent, propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-library trope via propagation delays and cyclic symbols into process-ontology; watch's loop constrains uniquely, risk of surreal non-causality heightens stakes paid in CR. No template echoes; inevitable hindsight from early cipher seed.</comment>
