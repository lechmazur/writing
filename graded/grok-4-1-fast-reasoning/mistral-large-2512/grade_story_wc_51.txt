<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied emotions and micro-choices excel, as burdens seep into skin, press chest, coil wrist, revealing contradictory resolve amid pain; final lighter body earns change via endured costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with air thickening, shadows hardening, burdens pulsing then dissolving into hush; RR closure reconfigures silence with felt risk of bronze bones legible in "grotto trembled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze ribs, thinnest north wall, dripping snowmelt constrain orientation and amplify transformation; starlight dimming charges final snowmelt-song image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to manifest/understand burdens escalates accumulatively via three intensifying forms and groaning walls, forcing endurance with cost of potential calcification narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of burden comprehension emerges organically from materializing shapes dissolving into fuller hush; final snowmelt-song reweights silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in fractal-noticing (grooves, boundary-less shadows); rhythmic diction modulates seamlessly as flame "flickered, then steadied."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddle; purposeful figures like "edges crisping like frost" integrate into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual calcifying abstract burdens into tactile forms transforms introspection; risk of bodily bronze heightens stakes organically.</comment>
