<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's reflective skepticism yields to pattern-seeing compulsion, with embodied pull (restless dream, moth-like draw) earning realization; old woman applies targeted pressure without diluting single-POV interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripple density tightens from dock to atrium pool, landing CR closure ("Elias understood then... The light had always been there") with legible conceptual cost of pre-shift perspective reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains stone-throw action and charges final ripple image; dawn mist and glass integrate tactilely, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of omen-interpretation deepens accumulatively from personal ripples (words half-remembered) to shared visions, forcing interpretive renunciation with felt cost in boundary-thinning urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mundane illumination emerges organically from glazier craft and ripple patterns; old woman's whisper slightly echoes thesis, muting pure emergence before CR resonance lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward light/prison patterns; dialogue subtextual and voice-distinct, advancing revelation without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels from descriptive builds to crisp climax action; figurative density (spectral shards, concentric questions) purposeful, no loops or artifacts dulling ripple closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ripple-oracle as pattern-language transforms superstition trope into glazier-specific CR; fresh atrium-ledgers synthesis risks lyric accumulation for inevitable mundane reweighting.</comment>
