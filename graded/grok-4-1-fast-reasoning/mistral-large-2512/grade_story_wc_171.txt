<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in trembling clipboard and exhaustion under pressure, with contradictory resolve earning the final shared commitment; micro-choices like accepting the coin reveal values. Kessar's penitent stance applies relational pressure without stereotypes. Minor flaw: Liora's tiredness borders on summary without deeper flaw complication in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbolic density (clipboard, coin, celestial alignment) tightens to Charged Poise closure, with cost legible in "the price of redemption was high, but so was the cost of walking away." Single scene oriented early; one deepening via Kessar's question narrows to joint carrying. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (jasmine, cicadas, scuffing boots) reflects Liora's priorities and guides ritual choice; terrace's worn stone and altar constrain the peak moment. Clipboard as micro-setting tool charges final image when looked down upon. Atmosphere tensions flawed beauty without clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal redemption signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dialogue probes and coin gesture forcing stance crystallization; agency in "let’s carry it together" forecloses solo endurance with relational cost. One tightening reweights tiredness into poise under lens. Stakes viscerally felt, not abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically from coin, treaty, and final breath, reweighting surrender as shared burden without moralizing; subtext in silences and Kessar's nod charges ending image. Protagonist arc inextricable from conflict. Resists tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (Liora's operative gentleness filters Kessar); dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("What’s left for you when the wars end?"), advances stakes. Rhythmic modulation under stress; distinct voices in clipped exchanges vs. reflective narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; sensory images woven into action without overwriting. Minor paraphrase loops on "price/cost" in reflection block (−0.3), but no closure touch or template cadence. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual terrace and lightning-struck clipboard transforms peace trope via personal alchemy angle. Coin's warm aliveness adds ingenuity without gimmick. Derivative echo of reluctant lovers in celestial bodies slightly hedges boldness.</comment>
