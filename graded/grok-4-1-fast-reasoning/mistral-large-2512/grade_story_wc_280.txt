<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia embodied concretely through colors tasting like lightning and pulsing violets, revealing Elias's particular perception; Liora's contradictory longing ("cruel" yet twitching fingers) acts in scene, earning her final hand-take with relational cost in flickering form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure in hand-hold amid fragile web of potentials; coin-spin fractures timeline on-page with legible conceptual cost in overlapping seasons and insistent echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's hum of apples/lightning and seasonal overlaps constrain action by responding to coin, charging final pulse; synesthetic filter biases details purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Liora's encore tightens accumulatively via echoes forcing her stance crystallization; hand-take forecloses impossibility path with felt fragility cost, driven by Elias's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nostalgia/hope emerges organically from might-have-been echoes reweighting despair without statement; final image of hand-hold offers resonant non-literal answer to encore longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("tasted like lightning") biases noticing distinctively; dialogue subtext-laden (Liora's "impossible" vs. hand) advances goal; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in ripple-fracture beat propels without loops; minor overwriting in "not in the way of broken glass, but like a reflection..." risks figurative strain but stays legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthesia + fractured potentials + ghost encore synthesize fresh angle on longing, with coin-turn reweighting timeline inevitability; risk of temporal warp heightens stakes organically.</comment>
