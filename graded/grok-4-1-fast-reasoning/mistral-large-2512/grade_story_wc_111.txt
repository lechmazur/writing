<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pretending not to care while ritualistically polishing the first marble; final renunciation of control earned through prior micro-choices like strategic marble placement. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in tending amid withering. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scattered marbles to self-placed map guiding to seedling CR, reweighting control premise with conceptual cost of mended deception legible in "the garden had never been his to control." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via garden responses suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrowing paths and rising roots constrain navigation, charging seedling-through-stone final image; sensory hierarchy (brittle leaves, clinking shears) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog. Micro-setting as maze pressures pragmatic play.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden's judgment) deepens accumulatively via marble exchanges narrowing to trust; agency in following crack-map forecloses control path with felt endurance cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive intensification at palm-marble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mended self-deception emerges organically from particulars like dried-blood rose and metallic seedling; final image reconfigures "I see you" pretense without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of garden's "love."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in garden-as-judging whispers; rhythmic modulation (short sentences in maze navigation) heightens pressure, diction biased toward vine-dresser idiom without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (cracks as "silver rivers," "knees popping like dry twigs"); varied rhythm propels without loops or overwriting, even in peak seedling kneel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient garden via cracked marbles post-luck era transforms control trope; risk in anthropomorphic subtlety heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via seedling payoff.</comment>
