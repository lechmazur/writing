<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in attentiveness to unseen workers drives concrete micro-choices like opening the envelope and delivering it, with hesitation showing internal conflict. Mara as secondary applies pressure via her request, forcing his commitment. Final fund agreement feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing inaction with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: misdelivery leads to delivery leads to fund request. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (library, post-symphony). Closure as CR via "cycle had begun again," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of ongoing commitment in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like salt-tinged air and flour-dusted scars filter through Elias's broker lens, guiding choices (ledger hides envelope). Breezy library constrains opening moment; inn's open windows charge final "scent of salt and possibility."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver gratitude, spark cycle) tightens via Mara's fund request, narrowing options with broker commitment cost. Agency in walk to inn and agreement forecloses passivity under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges from photo delivery and fund pivot without statement; final breeze image reconfigures initial library moment non-literally. Subtext in Mara's glistening eyes adds ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with clean focalization; perceptual bias (broker instincts on ledgers) distinct. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Depends who's asking") advances goals; voices distinguish via idiom (Mara's sharp exhale).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in delivery beat); density high, no loops. Minor overwriting in "cautious exuberance" but purposeful; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of misdelivery igniting compassion cycle via broker-dockworker link transforms kindness trope. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
