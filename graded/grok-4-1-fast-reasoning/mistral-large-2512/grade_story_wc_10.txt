<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation from shipwreck trauma drives concrete micro-choices like striking the fork, with embodied emotions (breath hitched, trembling fingers) earning the climactic triumph; Liora applies secondary pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from backstory shards to heat-map learning and climactic strike; CR closure lands on-page with legible cost in endured silence reconfigured ("silence... had a language"); orientation anchored early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory and frost patterns filter through Elias's silence, constraining the final strike on the pane and charging the color eruption image; sensory selection (cold seeping skin, invisible vibrations) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify silence) signaled early tightens via weeks of learning to climactic fork strike under accumulative lens, narrowing options with agency; cost felt in trembling and prior failure, charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence as canvas emerges organically from fork strikes, heat-maps, and color bloom; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence-without-sound, with ambiguity in "better" lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as blue dawn, silence as canvas); poetic diction modulates rhythmically, dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual ("You've done it"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in climactic color streaks; minor figurative density (frost symphonies, frozen leviathan) purposeful for tone, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, heat-mapped emotions as visual music, and tuning fork transforms silence trope; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, with bold synesthetic risk heightening closure.</comment>
