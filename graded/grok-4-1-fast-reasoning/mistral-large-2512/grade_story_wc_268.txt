<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied resolve ("fingertips trace," "pulse against her skin"); lifelong unbrokenness earns final choice without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure; rune pulse on skin delivers legible conceptual cost of unbroken life in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (dust motes, loose stone); library constrains discovery and charges final image without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via breadcrumb finds narrowing to rune; agency in prying stone forces trade-off with visible resolve cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in margins emerges from particulars; final scroll pulse reweights unbroken vs. broken rule-set without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scholarly perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; simile density coherent and pattern-taught, no loops obscuring rune discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library quest trope via living rune and ink ghosts; star-map twist inevitable from celestial hints without late rules.</comment>
