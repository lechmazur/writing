<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's pattern-seeing trait drives micro-choices like following cracks and lifting the manhole, with embodied sensations (warm punch, shallow breath) revealing motivation under pressure. Minimal shown internal contradiction slightly limits depth, but closure choice to take her hand feels earned by prior discoveries. Colleagues' descriptor integrates without telling excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ticket punch → pavement arrows → manhole → tunnel → invitation → hand taken with trembling cost. On-page DC closure legible in "tunnel trembled... train whistle split the dark," foreclosing normalcy. Orientation anchored early at 3:17 AM; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist pooling at manhole lip and jars rattling constrain descent and charge final tremble. Sensory mix (ozone, thrum) filtered through mapper's pattern bias (constellation cover, arrow fissures). Spatial choreography clear from alley to tunnel mouth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to chart hidden paths tightens causally through discoveries narrowing to "Will you come?" Agency peaks in hand-taking with burning punch cost. One decisive escalation suffices; woman's arrival complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unseen maps emerges via jars/tickets mirroring Elias's drive, resonating in final whistle without statement. Subtext in "chosen... only one who still believes" invites ambiguity on truths' value. Final image reconfigures pattern-seeking as commitment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mapper's perceptual signature (pavement angles as arrows, pulsing fissures). Lyrical rhythm modulates from deliberate ("traced a finger") to urgent ("didn’t hesitate"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing invitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "cracks... pulsed with purpose" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied syntax/paragraphs propel; minor metaphor density ("mist clinging like a living thing") purposeful without muddle in closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underground ticket vault transforms urban mystery tropes via jars of coordinates and "fortress of unspoken truths." Risky surrealism (mist afraid, humming punch) coheres causally to fresh DC closure. Inevitable hindsight from early punch seed.</comment>
