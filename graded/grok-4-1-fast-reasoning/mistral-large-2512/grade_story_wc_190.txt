<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in woman's shoulders relaxing and Elias's smile at closure; motivations root in concrete traits like glass attunement and ink fingers. Minor slip: woman's grief inferred without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via glass pulses to Charged Poise closure when liquid stills mirroring quiet, with felt emotional cost in her hesitation resolved on-page. Orientation anchored early in gondola/prism terrace; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains poling and drifting choices while charging final twilight image; water lapping and lanterns filter through Elias's silence-attuned POV, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comforting silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when glass darkens at her "wrong?" question, forcing Elias's stop-listen agency with visible cost in sustained drift. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from glass/water/quiet particulars, resonating in final "silence learned to comfort" image without statement; subtext in her pen hesitation yields non-literal answer via Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in silence-gaps and glass hums; dialogue subtextual ("right question") advances stake naturally, voice modulating rhythmically without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths; minor metaphor density in opening prism light but coherent and pattern-taught without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm glass as silence barometer transforms gondola trope into silence-as-weather premise; risk in lyric hush heightens stakes, inevitable in glass's approving hum hindsight.</comment>
