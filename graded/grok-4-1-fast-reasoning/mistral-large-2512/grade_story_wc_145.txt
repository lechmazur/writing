<question>1</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mira's dry-witted precision shines in concrete actions like tracing the atlas spine and window patterns, rooting motivation in map convergence; final demand earned by accumulating textual cues without epiphany. Keeper as secondary crucible forces verbal convergence. Contradictory seeing/unseeing impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of ice/memory patterns to Charged Poise closure; keeper's "ice remembers" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost in hesitation and falcon cry. Orientation anchored early in outpost/lake. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Condensation pattern as micro-setting constrains realization and charges final image, mirroring internal map quest; frozen lake/outpost tactile and selective via gloved palm press. Sensory hierarchy (breath fog, wind howl) reflects atlas editor bias. Environment guides choice to lake center.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (rivers/convergence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via falcon phrasebook to demand that forecloses stasis with felt risk (keeper hesitation). Cost legible in nod amid tranquility. Agency in micro-choice crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Ice forgetting/remembering reweights unseen maps via particulars like blank atlas page and glass rivulets; final falcon cry against tranquility offers non-literal answer to origins without moral. Subtext in phrasebook margin emerges organically. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns as maps); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to charged demand. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual—keeper's mutter carries revelation. No head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors (droplets creeping like cold drawing out) coherent and pattern-taught without muddle. No loops, varied rhythm accelerates to "falcon circled once more." Opening anchors stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/ice memory as convergence; condensation-as-map transforms trope organically. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes via reweighting, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
