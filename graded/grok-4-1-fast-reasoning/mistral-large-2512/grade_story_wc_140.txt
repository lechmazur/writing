<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in certificate error and mother's label compels concrete micro-choices like pocketing the cert and collecting fragments, with embodied contradiction in searching unrecallable memories. Final endurance of layered histories feels earned via woman's encounter. Minor slip: woman's epiphany-like lines ("Names are just labels we outgrow") slightly undercut his isolation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of frayed realities to Charged Poise/CR closure: scratched "Daniel Mercer" reconfigures search with conceptual cost of accepting layered erasure over recovery ("didn’t feel the need to run"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with taught pattern holds. Cost legible in trembling fingers and tide image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers as "jagged labyrinth" and tides constrain searches (mudflats reveal objects, high tide isolates), mirroring internal layers via tactile navigation. Final container scratches charge closure image. Sensory selection (diesel, salt, lapping water) reflects Elias's biased filter without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (frayed memory textures) signaled early tightens accumulatively via fragments and woman encounter, narrowing to renunciation with on-page cost (foreclosed endless search). Agency in endurance tests commitment; woman's shared history deepens pressure coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased histories emerge organically from certificate, graffiti, and label, with final scratches offering non-literal resonant answer: truth as "one story atop another." Subtext in ironic Forget-Me-Not and nameless woman avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in layered ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (reality as "layers," containers as "vessels for stories") biases details character-specifically. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Names are just labels we outgrow" evades direct reveal). Rhythmic modulation under rising density serves lens without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "trembling in his hands like a leaf caught in a storm" advances emotion/atmosphere); varied rhythm with purposeful figurative clusters taught early. No loops/artifacts; closure image crisp without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error igniting textural memory quest in lived port maze transforms identity tropes via containers' layers. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
