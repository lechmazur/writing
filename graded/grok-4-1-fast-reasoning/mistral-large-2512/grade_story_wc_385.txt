<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied senses (bare feet thrum, shell bites skin) and micro-choices under pressure (tightens grip, presses to ear, nods to sing); Veyan applies relational pressure. Minor slip: realization of split voices feels slightly unearned without deeper prior contradiction. Final choice earned with felt longing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds (hum → vibration → whisper → pulse → chorus) to Charged Poise closure when shell completes and they sing, reconfiguring echoes as bridge with legible longing cost ("saw the same longing"). Orientation anchored para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (coiled paths, damp earth/ozone, ground tremor) guides progressive path and mirrors internal hum; nexus leans in at climax. Canyon/ shell constrain choices (follow vibration, press to lips). Starlit face half-lit charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand echoes via shell) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via impressions to shell unification; agency in following/singing forecloses isolation path. Cost felt in longing/obligation; Veyan convergence forces crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented voices bridged emerges organically via shell/echo progression, no statements; final chorus reweights premise (secret → story) with resonant ambiguity. Longing in eyes/subtext charges without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (echoes in mind/canyon); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically (short punchy revelations amid flow). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You feel it too"; distinct idiom). No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (hum swells cadence); purposeful metaphors ("frozen serpents," "sound like a sigh") without muddle. Minor hum repetition pattern-taught, not loop; closure image clear/crisp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo singer + sound collector + shell bridge transforms fragment trope via sensory accumulative fantasy. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from opening hum to final chorus.</comment>
