<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in embodied memory (mother's hands guiding) and final palm-pressing renunciation of flinching earns stasis with sorrow's cost, rooted in consistent traits without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ink-tracing and memory builds to CR closure in saucer's pulsing warmth and non-flinch, with legible cost in "unspoken" name and enduring weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silvered grass and ozone constrain ritual choices; cracked saucer as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal wound without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming lost time tightens accumulatively through crack-mapping to palm-binding, forcing endurance trade-off; non-flinch crystallizes stance with felt sorrow cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of ink-seeped hands reweights handprint promises as irreducible debts, emerging organically from ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (heart-compass, mercury-time) modulates rhythm under reflective pressure; stable close-third POV with taught poetic compression pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via purposeful lyric metaphors (porcelain bone, mercury pool); no loops or artifacts dull final pulse/heartbeat image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh cloud-glade synthesis transforms cartomancy tropes via ink-bleeding fingers and tablecloth debts; risk-taking lyric risk heightens inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
