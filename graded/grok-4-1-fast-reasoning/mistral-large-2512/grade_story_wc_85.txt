<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt as sieve motif embodies contradictory impulses—falsifying others' pasts while doubting his own—with micro-choices like trembling hands tracing wood revealing values under pressure. Final watch-hand snap earns change via prior causality, foreclosing lie-bound life with felt emotional cost. Uncle's arrival forces relational crucible without safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sifting driftwood (setup) → symbol discovery → uncle's revelation → key handoff → watch snap as DC closure with legible cost in "snapped the hour hand in half." Single scene, orientation anchored early (terrace, dusk, Elias's job). No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood "ghost fingers" and worn railing constrain search and mirror smoothed lies, charging symbol find; dusk-to-indigo evolution pressures revelation. Sensory filter (smooth as bone) via Elias's pattern-seeking bias; spatial choreography clear from terrace to shore steps. Micro-setting (wood piece) shapes pivotal inciting beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister's truth amid self-made lies) signaled early, tightens causally via symbol → uncle's lie-confirm → boathouse key narrowing to chase; agency in pocketing key/snapping hand forecloses stasis with raw cost felt in chest-shift. Escalation protagonist-driven, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sieved truths emerges organically from Elias's forgeries vs. buried past, reweighted non-literally in final snap and "chasing it" image resolving want (quell noise) vs. need (dig truth). Subtext in uncle's carved guilt-symbol lingers with ambiguity (what's in boathouse?). No moralizing; irony earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns, sieved hush); diction/rhythm modulate from hushed reflection to raw propulsion. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your father paid me"), distinct voices (Elias sour, uncle regret-lined). No head-hopping; elision (uncle's familiarity) paid in reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "sieved hush" advances emotion/atmosphere/theme); rhythm varies (short punchy snaps at end). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs; metaphors cohere (sieve, smoothed edges). Propulsion peaks in "He snapped the hour hand in half."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Genealogist forging bloodlines irony transforms lost-sibling trope via driftwood self-carvings and watch as eternal lie-ticker. Fresh synthesis: sieved truths pattern inevitable to closure snap. Risks bold imagery (ghost fingers, bruised sky) heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
