<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to appraise echoes and navigate without moving is clear and intensifies through patient observation, but lacks deep internal contradiction or embodied flaws acting simultaneously; competence dominates without much struggle. Final realization feels earned via prior cues like the arrowhead, yet epiphany edges toward unearned without sharper micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build from bird flight to echo alignment to chamber melody, with on-page CR closure ("weight of centuries settling into his bones") showing felt cost in eternal wandering. Orientation anchored early (canyon, ledge by para 1). Flock banking provides one meaningful tightening disrupting pattern into action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (humming bone towers, dust strata, parchment scent) filter through Elias's pattern-seeking bias and constrain choices, like pressing arrowhead to etched tower base revealing seam. Recurring dust/echoes charge final image. Towers guide path without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise/navigate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via flock disruption narrowing to tower action and skimmer strike; agency in observation-to-decision forecloses doubt with cost in "content to wander its echoes forever." One tightening via sign suffices, pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of past-as-compass emerges organically from echoes/birds/relics, with final melody reweighting "pulse left wandering" into resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like arrowhead key avoid abstraction; ambiguity in navigators' fate lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing rhythms/vibrations/biases toward patterns); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, syntax purposeful for texture (e.g., "breath curling into the still air like a question unanswered"). No head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early via echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (dust as strata/ghost sigh) integrated without muddle; minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught via echoes pays off. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion aligns with scene breathing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric navigation via birds/echoes/stones transforms trope of ancient relic quest; bone towers and skimmer song feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
