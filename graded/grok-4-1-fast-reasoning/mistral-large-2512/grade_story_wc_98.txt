<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's reluctance ("never dared to plant it") clashes with duty in contradictory impulses, embodied in clenching her fist and planting despite fear; final guardianship earned via dream revelation with selective telling as cost. Nani briefly pressures via seed handover. Minor stock phrasing like "breath hitched" prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: reluctance → Nani confrontation → dream → planting → revelation → partial disclosure (DC/CR). Orientation anchored early ("island’s only reality checker... ridge"). Closure reconfigures stance with cost in "Not all of it—some truths needed time," felt in bracelet vine; lens holds cleanly, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent blossoms and ridge constrain planting choice and charge final image ("blossoms lighting her path"); sensory details (glow seeping skin, earth dug) integrated via tactile action, POV-filtered urgency before monsoon. Evolving environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect memory pre-monsoon) signaled early, tightens via revelation narrowing options (tell truths risking unraveling vs. withhold); agency in planting/reading forecloses reluctance path with conceptual cost legible in partial decision. No live option fully tested prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory as tended garden vs. monsoon thief) emerges via seed/dream/pages, resonant in final CR ("now she knew what it truly wanted") reweighting pact without moralizing; subtext in selective telling embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (glyphs on face/seed); voice texture luminous/mythic ("petal shimmered silver," "words bloomed"), modulates rhythm under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The monsoon doesn’t just wash away dirt"); minor elevated diction fits fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "sprout unfurled, its leaves unfolding into pages") propels via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors in peak (planting/revelation). Figurative language purposeful, not overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh monsoon-memory pact via living archive/pages transforms trope; seed-to-vine synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk in partial revelation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
