<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation as lore keeper is rooted in world stewardship and embodied through decisive micro-choices like scraping bark and descending, culminating in earned acceptance of the throne's weight. Interiority feels particular via her recall of warnings and pulse quickening under pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density from flake opening staircase to murals revealing test, tightening to throne sitting where murals flare and weight settles as Charged Poise closure with felt cost. Orientation anchored early via Neon Grove and waterfall. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; cost legible in "weight of the unclaimed throne settle onto her shoulders."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "prismatic sheets shifted like liquid stained glass" and pulsing fruit integrate into action, with bark/murals constraining choices (scraping reveals map) and charging final dawn image. POV bias shapes notice of bioluminescent vines and ozone scent. Environment subtly mirrors layered seeing beyond surface.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to claim throne via discoveries signaled early; Accumulative tightening via mural shifts narrows to test of insight, with agency in peeling and sitting foreclosing inaction at cost of responsibility. One deepening suffices; cost felt in trembling chamber and settling weight. Minor abstractness in world unraveling keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of seeing beyond surfaces emerges organically from peeling murals and shifting histories, reweighted in throne's rippling acceptance without moralizing. Final image of dawn orchard offers resonant answer to stewardship question. Particulars like ruby flake dissolution avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in lore-keeper's focus on texts, vines, and murals; diction modulates from descriptive entry to tense descent ("pulse quickened"). Rhythmic control heightens charged poise at sitting. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ruby flake... hummed faintly, as if alive" advancing multiple layers; rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud natural. Minor "rippled" repetition near staircase but no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors touching closure. Zero artifacts in peak throne beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of futuristic orchard test via peeling layers transforms chosen-one trope through insight mechanic. Layered murals and throne of living wood feel organic to lore-keeper's quest. Risk in shifting mural cityscape pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
