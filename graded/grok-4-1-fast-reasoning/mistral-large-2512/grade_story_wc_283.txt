<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in weight of objects drives cataloging to closure, with embodied perception in button wear and echo hum; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal scene moment, muting internal tension before last button.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via button patterns building to hourglass shudder and sand reversal (CR closure) with felt cost in time's slowing breath; orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, full gates met.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber light, groaning beams, and dust motes constrain sorting on workbench and charge final unearthed silence; selective sensory filter (whispering sand, humming jar) mirrors quiet inspiration without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of spinning prophecy via buttons tightens accumulatively to last silver button slotting in, forcing renunciation of fulfillment with cost in resumed downward sand; single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of prophecies as spun anew emerges organically from buttons/echo/hourglass particulars, resonant in final note and realization without statement; reweights prior unraveling with non-literal complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in object weights/traces (bent shank, tarnished edges); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive density to charged poise at "sand resumed its downward fall, slower now."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (spilled buttons, slotted gap) with propulsion; figurative layering (unraveled spool, captured sunset) taught early as lyric pattern without muddle, though pervasive in peak risks slight overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost buttons as prophecy puzzle transforms trope into inevitable pattern break at hourglass reversal; risk in quiet CR heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
