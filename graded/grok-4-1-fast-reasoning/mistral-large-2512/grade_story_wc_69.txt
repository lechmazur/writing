<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miss Voss's interiority shines in "quiet certainty of someone who had traveled far," rooting her motivation to unify; choir members like Maren and Liora gain specificity through micro-dynamics that evolve. Secondary characters apply pressure without overwhelming single-POV focus. Final hope feels earned via persistent micro-choices under grudge tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rehearsal shards build density to Charged Poise closure in "Maren’s hand found Liora’s... fingers brushing like leaves," reconfiguring discord to harmony with unlearning cost legible. Orientation anchors early in library/choir setup. No orientation debt; shards taught by first rehearsal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zither's "soundhole rosette... worn smooth" as micro-setting constrains unification choice and charges final set-down image. Velvet library/cinnamon/autumn wind sensory details filter via Voss's preservation bias, mirroring internal thaw. Spatial coherence in library/piano bench holds across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify fractured choir) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via zither initiation and rehearsal progression narrowing grudge options. Agency in "kept playing... fingers moving with quiet certainty" forces trade-off of pride wounds. Cost felt in "cracks... old hatreds threatened," culminating visibly at perfect hymn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening to braid voices emerges organically from zither beat and hand-touch image, reweighting "noise... in silences" without statement. Final "vanishing arts... remembered" offers non-literal resonance on unlearning, embracing ambiguity in imperfect start. No moralizing; complexity in lingering hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in Voss's "stillness of distant places" biases noticing (e.g., "lips thinned"); lyrical rhythm modulates from wind-rattled tension to stilled hope. Minimal dialogue ("Sing with me") natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; compression in rehearsals purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops/paraphrase; metaphors like "vines around a trellis" purposeful without muddle in peak rehearsal beats. Rhythmic variety propels from "trembling note" to "throat tight," read-aloud smooth. Zero artifacts; propulsion integrates image/action seamlessly to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zither as unifying thread transforms harmony trope into unlearning via "subtract noise," fresh synthesis grounded in choir specifics. Risk in accumulative shards heightens emotional stakes without gimmick. Final leaves/hope image inevitable from autumn seed.</comment>
