<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Collector's motivation to pursue laughter roots deeply in his failed past, embodied via the tooth's reminder and culminating in the chest-warmth realization; contradictory impulses (abandoned duty vs. rebellion) act in his approach and acceptance. Woman's laugh forces his micro-choice to sit, earning the closure change with felt cost against centuries of burden. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via spectral fragments building to harp's swell; single continuous scene oriented by ~50 words (Echo Gorge, collector's domain). Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in laughter-note handoff and dawn step-forward, reconfiguring his ghostly state with undeniable emotional cost legible in "for the first time... he did not feel like a ghost."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp wind's wet stone/sorrow scent, harp's clashing notes) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal gloom; gorge faces and cliffs constrain approach while charging final gold/rose sunrise image. Micro-setting (rock, plucked note) guides sitting and closure exchange. No white-room; evolved with light break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue real laughter for self-healing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via harp-notes to woman's bright laugh forcing receipt/renunciation of ghost-state. Agency in listening/approaching/sitting forecloses isolation path with chest-warmth cost; no coincidence resolution. Legible price shapes final dawn step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of laughter stitching souls emerges organically from particulars (choked laughter fragments to pure firefly-note); final image non-literally answers "can he remember laughing?" via reconfiguration without moral. Subtext in her "forgot how to leave" mirrors his rebellion; ambiguity lingers in flickering dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (noticing warped lullabies, tooth's press); voice modulates rhythm from hushed fragments to swelling music under rising light. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Not anymore") pursues recognition; distinct idioms (her reed-voice vs. his admissions). No head-hopping; diction fits haunted lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short harp sentences build to long sunrise); high density integrates image/action without loops or scaffolds. Figurative purpose-built (sky's "spilled ink," laugh "like a blade") charges peaks without muddle; minor density in opening descriptions purposeful for textural lens. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms soul-collector trope via laughter rebellion and tooth-mercy/cruelty reminder; risk in luminous lyricism heightens emotional stakes without gimmick. Final note-pluck/heat reweighting feels inevitable from gorge whispers; no derivative templates, fully committed premise.</comment>
