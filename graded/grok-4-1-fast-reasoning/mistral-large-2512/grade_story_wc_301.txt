<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (steady hands vs. uncured guilt) drive micro-choices like tracing graffiti; final endurance shift from forgiveness-seeking to truth-living feels earned with cost. Minor slip in self-applied "truth-seeking river chronicler" label feeling told rather than fully shown through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from graffiti/map/accordion to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early in station bathroom. Final "walked on, daringly methodical, toward the river" reconfigures stance with legible ongoing-cost current imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy tendrils, porcelain coolness, river hum) filtered through chronicler POV constrain choices (station as archive) and charge final ivy rustle/whisper image. Recurring ivy mirrors internal currents without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant guilt stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via graffiti realizations narrowing from redemption to endurance; one deepening (forgiveness as path walked) forecloses prior running with felt cost in continued search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth currents vs. lies emerges organically from particulars (wrong coordinates, graffiti pleas) to resonant CR end reweighting map/search without moralizing; final image answers "path to live with truth" non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in graffiti, river whispers); rhythmic prose modulates from raw discord to poised cadence, perceptual bias character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; purposeful figuratives (ivy fingers, bellows groan) integrate without muddle. Minor paraphrase risk in guilt iterations avoided by accumulating texture toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti wisdom chronicler and error-map transforms guilt trope; bold quiet Charged Poise ending risks stillness but heightens stakes via ivy/river whisper payoff from established particulars.</comment>
