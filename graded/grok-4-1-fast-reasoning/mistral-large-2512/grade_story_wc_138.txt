<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to compel climax choice, embodied in "grip tightened" and "curse spreading like wildfire"; minor slip in early told block "simple, yet achingly profound" lacks full contradiction until hesitation vs. lunge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore from storm weakening barriers to Kael's arrival and Veyra's channel causing DC (Kael vanishes); closure CR legible in "after goodbye, there was only silence" with felt curse cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and magnetic fields constrain climax ("walls shimmering... pulling at the fabric") and charge final dim glow; sensory hierarchy (prickle, metallic taste) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amulet answers) tightens causally at lunge/channel, narrowing to sacrifice trade-off with agency in "slamming her palm"; cost visible in burning fragment, foreclosing reckless path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from void motif to CR silence acceptance, reweighting premise without statement; final "wasn’t afraid of it" resonates non-literally from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (dimensional awareness filters light/storm); dialogue natural/subtextual ("too afraid to cross the line") advances goals; rhythmic diction modulates to hushed climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory ("charged particles colliding... amplifying"); varied rhythm accelerates to "storm reached its peak"; purposeful "magnetic fields" repeats build without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional immortality and goodbye-void via amulet/storm; transforms tropes through Veyra's earned stasis, risk in curse channel heightens without gimmick.</comment>
