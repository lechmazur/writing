<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in mapping and patience-sculpting, with final handclasp as earned alliance foreclosing solitude; interiority embodied in tactile sensations like palm on stone and ice give, but reflective summaries occasionally abstract contradictory impulses into labels rather than simultaneous action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from viaduct hum to stranger's emergence; on-page Charged Poise closure in handclasp reconfigures isolation with legible commitment cost toward the lake; orientation anchored early in sanctuary/lake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt spires, pulsing viaduct slick with rain-melt, and thin ice skin vividly constrain perception and mirror internal stakes; frozen lake charges final image as deceptive depths swallowing commitment; selective sensory hierarchy (ozone, thrum) biases through Elias's vigilant lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sensing/joining patient revolution signaled early and tightens accumulatively via deepening hum and stranger; agency in unhurried handclasp forecloses prior detachment with felt relational cost; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Patient revolution theme emerges organically from particulars like moon paths and ice erosion, reweighted in final shared gaze without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure answers impatience via alliance image; ambiguity lingers in tides' certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in horizon-mapping details; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to charged; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("You feel it too"), with subtext of recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in high-pressure hum-deepening beat stacks metaphors ("stretching its spine," "earth's breath") without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vigilant mapping and humming relic as revolution metaphor, transformed via softly purposeful pulses; risk in restrained lyric build to quiet alliance pays off without gimmick.</comment>
