<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in archival traits drives photo arrangement, with embodied calm in lingering; minor slip in unearned epiphany lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in final realization paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via photo density buildup to self-inserted image and dove perch; CR closure reconfigures personal meaning with felt cost of forgotten life legible in "he had forgotten to live his own story."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Factory ruins and lavender field constrain arrangement and mirror resilience via vines curling "like fingers," charging dawn-lit final image; sensory selection POV-biased toward light/shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake of transmuting pain tightens accumulatively through arc formation and self-photo addition, narrowing to personal reconfiguration; cost felt in realizing overlooked life forecloses solitary search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Collective healing emerges from photo particulars, resonating non-literally in dove-lit act-as-masterpiece image; avoids moralizing despite near-direct lines like "healing was not a solitary act."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature on fragments/light sustains texture; stable close-POV with no leakage, modulating rhythm toward charged poise in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and multi-job lines propel; minor paraphrase loops in photo descriptions ("wearied but determined," "gnarled with age and labor") contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Photographic archive in ruins/lavender freshens healing trope via archivist's quiet synthesis; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens personal stakes organically.</comment>
