<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ren's zen potter traits shine in concrete micro-choices like shaping the bowl to mimic land dips and placing it at the hive, rooting motivation in persistent life-draw. Interiority particular via sun-pattern lessons and lantern thrum embodiment, with earned shift to fractured-time realization. Minor slip in "phototropic to kindness" label without deep contradictory impulse in peak listen beat slightly limits 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: textural density of oasis ghosts, lantern shifts, and smoke builds to on-page CR closure where glass mends and bowl fills honey, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of time's tangled persistence. Orientation anchored early in potter-kneeling at cracked earth. Single tightening via fire-light/listen beat narrows to audible past, with lantern as persistent constraint charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (wind hum through hives, lavender bloom, honey scent sans bees) filters via Ren's light-pattern gaze, constraining path to oldest hive center. Setting evolves causally (air thickens, sand shifts), mirroring internal fractures and charging closure honey-fill. Micro-setting of lantern glass and clay bowl as pivotal tools heightens 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probing oasis resistance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thrum intensification, audible ghosts, to CR reconfiguration under lens. Ren's agency in bowl ritual/fire peaks pressure, foreclosing change-resistance path with felt conceptual cost in time-holding realization. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stake declaration before embodiment holds from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time-fracture persistence emerges organically from particulars (shifting cracks, out-season bloom, flattening smoke), culminating in non-literal CR answer: oasis holds all selves with splinter-cost. Subtext in lantern's breathing veins recharges prior images without moralizing. Final honey image reweights premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in light/clay biases (cracks catch light like veins, shadows as fingers). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating to thicker warmth at center; purposeful compression in realization pays off legibly. No dialogue; minor elevated diction in "phototropic" fits zen voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm; sentences multi-job (e.g., "The cracks within it seemed to shift... as if breathing" advances plot/atmosphere). Purposeful figuratives (smoke flattens, time roots) consistent without muddle in peak listen beat. Slight paraphrase loop in two "he had seen this before" instances dings minimally, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wasteland potter's clay ritual unlocks time-oasis via beekeeping ghosts and mending lantern, transforming post-apoc tropes through phototropic persistence. Risky CR closure inevitable from established fractures; no derivative echoes, bold lyric accumulation heightens stakes cleanly (+0.3 risk).</comment>
