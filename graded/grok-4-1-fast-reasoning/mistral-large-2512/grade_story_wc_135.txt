<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to compile fragments intensifies through acquiring valves, shown in trembling fingers reaching for the third; embodied reactions like tasting salt reveal traits under pressure. Internal conflict subtle but consistent in reactive vision enabling pattern recognition. Minor label slips like "reactively visionary" slightly dilute without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragments build density to CR closure in valve-map revelation ("a map, etched into the metal"), reweighting exile with erasure cost. Orientation anchored early (harbor, post-exile). Single tightening via third valve suffices; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's slick docks, gust-spray, wet stone constrain movement (alley shadows, signal knock); sensory hierarchy (salt taste amid urgency) mirrors absences. Watchtower oil/paper charges final image. Environment shapes tactics without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite valves for truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with third valve/map, foreclosing ignorance via Dain's revelation ("They erased us"). Agency in pursuit visible; cost felt in historical erasure. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stitching absences emerges organically via fragments/valves into map, final image ("sound the truth") reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in salt-echoes, erasure charged by particulars. Resonant non-literal close ties to Liora's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (patterns in noise); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Did you find it?", "They erased us") advances goal, distinct idioms. Rhythmic modulation under pressure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short gust beats to trembling reach); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("gaped like missing teeth"). Propulsion peaks clean in map reveal; zero scaffold dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: valves-as-map transforms exile trope via archivist quest; risk in fantasy relics (humming brass) heightens stakes organically. Ingenuity in accumulative fragments inevitable at CR.</comment>
