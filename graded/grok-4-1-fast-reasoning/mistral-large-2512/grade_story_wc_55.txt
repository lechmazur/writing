<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's introversion and risk-aversion shine in hesitation with the girl and buried forecourt memory, with contradictory impulses peaking when he follows the bear; final peace feels earned via resurfaced maternal cues without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory memories and stillness build to forecourt RR (Charged Poise in kneeling/listening), with legible cost in "let himself remember"; bear-led transition tightens coherently without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains climax choice by humming/whispering post-rain, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (oil/parchment to dew rainbows) filters via scribe's tactile bias, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoid vs confront past) signaled early via forecourt avoidance, tightens accumulatively through girl-triggered memories and bear sighting forcing agency (follow/ kneel); cost felt in emotional exposure at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of petrichor-nostalgic reconciliation emerges organically from box/forecourt reprise shifting from avoidance to embrace; final quartz hum offers non-literal resonance reweighting abandonment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with scribe-specific perceptual signature (gear-oiled scents, ticking hush); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Please," "Come in"), rhythmic control heightens dawn tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punches at bear sighting: "Its breath steamed... fixed on him"); no loops/artifacts dull closure, purposeful lyricism ("glacial hush") taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bear as patient guide transforms abandonment trope into fresh magical nudge toward forecourt; risk in surreal alley beast heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via memory texture.</comment>
