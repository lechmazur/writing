<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—disbelief but staying to propagate—and final endurance earned by burying photo as seed, revealing values hierarchy with cost of forgoing blind hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from photo creases to drone vibrations to sprouting cutting; Charged Poise closure in "She simply tended it" reconfigures endurance with legible emotional cost of uncelebrated persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchid terrarium constrains drone-panic choice ("Look at the orchid") and charges final image of roots persisting amid crashing sea, with sensory selection (chlorophyll hands, swaying petals) mirroring internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-endurance signaled early tightens accumulatively at drone hum reversal, forcing gaze-shift agency; cost legible in foreclosed celebration after sprout, charging poise under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of smoothed photo and tended cutting offers resonant non-literal answer to realism-vs-hope, reweighting orchid/ledger particulars without moralizing; emerges organically from conflicted propagation choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward tactile soil cues and embodied breath; Mira's dialogue subtextual ("You're the one who survived") advances stakes naturally without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm (short drone sentences vs. blurred weeks); purposeful "pearl of stillness" recurrence taught early avoids loops, no figurative muddle in peak freeze beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-trauma and botanical endurance transforms healing trope via listening orchid and somatic ledger entry; risk in lyric time-blur heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
