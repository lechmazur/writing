<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's quietly analytic trait compels parsing of logs and hesitation before shattering, earning the final letting-go with embodied contradiction; Death as colleague personifies stakes consistently without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening discoveries (globe, logs, Liora) to CR closure in shattering and hull release; orientation anchored by ~50 words, cost legible in vanishing words and invitation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library's silt, creaks, and current constrain dives and door nudge, charging globe as micro-setting in climax shatter; sensory hierarchy (light glint, whale song) reflects analytic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasping disappearance physics) deepens accumulatively via Liora's apparition narrowing to shatter choice; agency forecloses holding with hull's release as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Letting-go theme emerges organically from globe swirl to thread untangling and final vanishing words, reweighting premise in CR without moralizing; ambiguity of lives released lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (death as colleague/breath) modulates rhythm under pressure; Liora's crackle dialogue carries subtext advancing plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm (short shatter sentences amid poetic builds); metaphors like "silt like ash" integrate without muddle, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart replica globe as time key transforms ghost-ship trope; risk in physics-of-disappearance premise follows implications to inevitable CR without retreat.</comment>
