<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority embodied in trembling fingers and erasing the portrait reveals contradictory impulses to cling and release, earning the final endurance; minor diagnostic phrasing like "Is this what it feels like to unravel?" slightly abstracts peak reflection without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of shrinking walls and pattern break in redesigning cards/portrait leading to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "let the claustrophobia settle into his bones" and awakening to draw the ache, reconfiguring loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's breathing walls and salt-parchment air constrain choices, mirroring internal unraveling; recurring charcoal/tools charge final image of drawing "the shape of the ache," fulfilling 9+ test without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redesigning post-loss escalates via density increase to walls-as-coffin, forcing agency in acceptance; one decisive deepening forecloses clinging with embodied cost in lying down as walls close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically through redesigned cards and erased portrait; final image of drawing the ache offers resonant non-literal answer to "How do you redesign a life?" reweighting prior ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in fractured metaphors like "light fractured through the lighthouse’s prism"; rhythmic modulation under pressure maintains coherence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "drowning in slow motion"); minor repetitive stems in questions avoided major loops, propulsion clear to closure without artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shrinking library as psyche crucible transforms breakup trope; redesigning tarot meanings risks bold metaphor payoff at awakening swirl, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
