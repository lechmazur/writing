<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Concrete embodiment in teeth ache and trembling hands grounds emotions, but "Elias understood then" delivers an unearned epiphany leap that undercuts internal conflict's micro-progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from chip hum to melody/light RR closure; memory jolt and slotting act provide legible cost via grief confrontation, anchoring single scene cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chamber's vibrations and oil scent constrain choices while mirroring internal decay; crimson chip as micro-setting charges final golden light image indelibly.</comment>
