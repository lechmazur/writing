<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in pomegranate weight and stained fingers embodying shift from grief-archivist to prophecy-liver; contradictory impulses act via recitations amid orchard's darkening witness; earned change forecloses passive archiving with lived cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from Sumerian breath-capture to pomegranate surrender and whisper-chorus, yielding charged poise CR in "silence... invitation" with conceptual cost of embodied prophecy; orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard roots-through-steel and falling pomegranate constrain recitation choices and charge final stained-fingers image; sensory hierarchy (bark-touch, juice-drip, wind-rustle) reflects Elias's omen bias; details evolve causally with darkening sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive grief/void?) deepens accumulatively via omen layering to chorus reversal, narrowing to invitation-embrace; agency in phonograph rituals yields visible costs (straining mechanism, stained commitment); minor abstractness in initial "suspected they wanted more."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lived prophecy emerges organically from particulars (foghorn ghost, fruit pulse, whisper-borrow); final cylinder-as-ghost-note image reweights silence premise non-literally; ambiguity lingers in Archives' denial without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward dead tongues and omens; rhythmic modulation accelerates in recitations, breathes in memories; purposeful compression of unnamed language pays off in chorus reveal without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "needle hissed, then caught, recording... surrender"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; figurative control (words curling like smoke) enhances without muddling peak phonograph strain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph-as-oath-recorder in skyscraper orchard transforms prophecy trope via juice-recording and foghorn resonance; risk in nameless language heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from field-trip seed to stained smile.</comment>
