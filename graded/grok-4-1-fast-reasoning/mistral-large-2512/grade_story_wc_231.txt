<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's routine disrupted by intrusion shows contradictory impulses acting in scene (routine hollow vs. borrowed memories fitting like puzzle), earning final acceptance with visible cost of tending the bequeathed story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure in "He understood then: the man hadn’t come to die... bequeathed," with legible emotional cost of inherited grief reconfiguring routine life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and dock constrain isolation, charging final beam sweep over opal planks; recurring lighthouse beam mirrors internal persistence, with alpine scent filtering through Elias's routine bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture tightens via memory immersion, narrowing options to acceptance with felt cost of "grief, the unspoken love"; minor abstractness in early gaps observation slightly mutes escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bequeathed stories emerges organically from boutonnière and memories, with final image offering resonant CR repricing isolation as "promise" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory borrowings (crunch of snow, absinthe taste); rhythmic modulation heightens immersion without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful (mist as "ghostly fingers," beam "flicker[ing] like half-remembered dreams") without muddle in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of borrowed memories via Edelweiss transforms lighthouse isolation trope; risk of supernatural tint pays off in charged CR without gimmickry.</comment>
