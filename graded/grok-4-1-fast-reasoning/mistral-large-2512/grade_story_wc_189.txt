<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—detailed observation of cicada vs. evaded conversation—with final realization earned by prior pattern-building; warmly observant trait shown through specific hermit crab and salt crystal notices, compelling return with felt cost of facing pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations tightens to cicada sinking ("through it, as if the pool were a veil"), yielding CR closure where silence reconfigures as door with undeniable opportunity cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's tidal pool constrains choice (cicada placement/sinking) and charges final image (ripples distort stars); sensory details like "lacework of salt crystals" filter through POV's observant bias, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cicada/time pattern) signaled early, deepens via dream and sinking to force stance crystallization on conversation; agency in tangential observation forecloses escape with legible relational cost, though no micro-turn reversal limits to high 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from particulars (cicada warmth post-dream, veil-sinking); final line ("stars were still watching. So was time") offers resonant CR reweighting without moral, embracing ambiguity of patterns vs. omens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in observant lyricism ("fingers tracing the water’s surface, leaving ripples that dissolved"); stable close-3rd POV with rhythmic modulation under realization pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "ripples spread, distorting the reflection... cicada began to sink"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "honey or like sand" cohere without muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of cicada-as-key unlocking personal transition feels inevitable from established observant patterns; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
