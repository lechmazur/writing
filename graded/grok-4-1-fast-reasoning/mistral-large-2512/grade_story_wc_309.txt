<comment>Elias's motivation roots in consistent failures, embodied in numb fingers and drinking the light that surfaces memories; contradictory shame and spark drive micro-choices like unstrapping. Final pressing of drop earns change with cost of acknowledged limits. Minor slip in stock "quiet shame" phrasing, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: image density (mist, light) builds knowledge to CR closure in flower bloom reweighting "sacred in simple," with cost of unstrapped doubts legible in solid hands. Orientation anchors early (spire base). Two-shard structure (outer/inner) holds; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vivid sensory selectivity: alive mist clings skin, liquid light burns like waking, constraining choices (unstrap to enter, press drop). Keystone and snow mirror internal thaw in final flower. Black glass courtyard charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (sacred/simple) signaled early, accumulates via drink's deepening (spark knowing), forcing renunciation of grand spells. Agency in unstrapping/drinking forecloses doubt path with felt cost. Lens-consistent tightening reweights underachievement.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: slow learner distinction via memories and flower as non-literal answer to failures. Luminance motif shifts from spire to petal, charging closure without statement. Complexity in accepting limits lingers authentically.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (failed spells filter world); rhythmic prose modulates (short sentences in mist unraveling). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("slow learner"), advances revelation. No head-hopping; elision in mist taught/paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (satchel falls, world tilts). Varied rhythm accelerates in mist; no loops or scaffolds. Minor light-synonym churn, but doesn't dull closure flow or image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spire automating creativity remnants enables "impossibilities" for underachiever's quiet epiphany, transforming mage tropes via simple flower. Risk in lyric shards heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
