<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Solid interiority via concrete sensations like "splinter" in chest and breath catching at the developed image; micro-choices like exposure adjustments reveal values under light's pressure. Final change (weight lifting) feels earned via prior longing. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog/light/ruins builds to CR closure in pinning print where "fog curled around their ankles" reconfigures lost joy with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (orchard, fog). One tightening via surprising image (hand holding apple) narrows interpretive options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and slanting light constrain photography choices and charge final image ("morning light" on print amid thinning fog). Sensory hierarchy (visual glow prioritized) fits artist's perceptual bias; ruins evolve causally with fog thinning. Environment mirrors internal uncovering without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover fresco's joy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via developed image's reversal (reaching to holding), forcing stance shift at display. Cost legible in lifted "weight in her chest." Quiet agency via endurance in waiting/process fits lens; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering joy emerges organically from light-exposure process to final print reweighting fresco's longing; resonant non-literal answer in "apple within reach" callbacks child motif without stating moral. Complexity in joy as uncovered layers lingers plausibly. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (light as medium) biased to artist's eye; voice texture in rhythmic, luminous diction modulates from pensive setup to charged poise at end. Old woman's dialogue natural, subtextual ("gave it back its joy"). No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long atmospheric opens, tight revelations); high density in image-emergence lines ("chemicals swirling like the fog"). Minor figurative density in opening fog/tree metaphors purposeful for tone, not muddling peaks. No loops; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography as "painting with light" on decayed fresco transforms artist-redemption trope via specific exposure process yielding impossible joy-image. Risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at display without gimmickry. Organic to voice/setting.</comment>
