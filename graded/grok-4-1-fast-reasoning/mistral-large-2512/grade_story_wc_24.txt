<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in rational key-turning yielding to visceral thumb-prick, earning realization with embodied cost; interiority particular to time-obsessed worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying sensory density and counting repetitions to CR closure ("Clocks didn’t measure time—they measured resistance") with legible blood-cost; orientation anchors early, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Razor-edged clock hands and wavering horizon constrain pivotal blood choice and charge final restoration image; sensory details (hiss, ozone) selectively bias through Elias's professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore/understand clocks) escalates accumulatively to agency-driven blood sacrifice, foreclosing rational path with unmistakable pain-price that recharges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>CR reweights time-as-river to resistance/tide through particulars (scraped numbers, blood-turn), offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext emerges organically from struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (time/scent fixation) and rhythmic control ("fifty-nine... fifty-eight") heighten pressure; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (razor holding, tide foam), rhythm varies read-aloud without overwriting in peak blood beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic clocks measuring "resistance" transforms time trope through grounded anomaly and blood-logic; risk-taking in CR premise heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
