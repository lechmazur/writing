<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve trust drives inventive micro-choices like the vine harness, with embodied contradiction between passive watcher and active climber; final endurance after snap feels earned, though label-like traits ("attentively inventive") slightly abstract the interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds from perch to climb, culminating in Charged Poise closure via snap/recovery with legible cost (vine jerk, gasps); orientation anchored early, one tightening via branch failure narrows options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arbor bark, vines, and buckle constrain choices (harness creation, snap catch) and charge final pull-up image; sensory details (whispering leaves, groaning branch) selectively heighten textural pressure, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove patterns/trust via descent) signaled early, escalates texturally via wind/branch groan to snap reversal that forces endurance trade-off; protagonist agency in climbing tightens pressure with on-page cost (bite of buckle, suspension).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of observation-to-action emerges organically from particulars (passive sky-watching vs. tactile climb), reweighted in final image of closer city lights without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in trust's preservation lingers post-snap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of pattern-seeking (bark veins as Braille); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short gasps at snap), diction poetic yet biased toward tactile/auditory textures without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax in climb beats, but overwriting in opening (stacked metaphors like "cathedral... slow-motion storm") dulls early density; snap moment clean, no loops, high specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial observer stranded in arboreal puzzle transforms survival trope via pattern motif and inventive buckle use; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
