<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's noticing compulsion drives concrete micro-choices like carrying bread and planting seeds, earning final endurance; woman's dialogue forces relational pressure revealing his values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building slippages to CR closure in planting/tea image ("weight... lighter. Not gone, but tenuous"), reweighting erasure with legible conceptual cost of persistence's fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard/tea house soil constrains planting choice and charges final shoot image; sensory gaps (scents absent/present) mirror internal slippage without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of combatting erasure tightens accumulatively through dialogue reframing and planting agency, foreclosing denial with felt chest-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary persistence emerges organically via bread/seeds reprise, final line ("Something that wasn’t there before") resonantly reweights absence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual noticing bias ("gaps between what was and what had been"); dialogue subtextual, voices distinct in idiom without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic control varies sentence lengths for propulsion; "real" triplet purposeful texture without loop, minor overwriting in metaphors coherent to voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening as absolution synthesizes noticing/loss into fresh, inevitable CR; risks lyric compression on slippage pattern without gimmickry.</comment>
