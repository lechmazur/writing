<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority embodied in eel-herding precision and chest-weight promise; micro-choices under unraveling reveal values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from friction loss to rock sequence and eel shard, landing RR closure in aurora flare and temporary mend with conceptual cost ("at least for a little while").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff's damp earth and aurora pools constrain rock placement, charging final image; sensory filter (salt-stiff air, eel brushes) biases via Elias's precog curse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to mend patterns tightens via vanished friction inciting rock harnessing; agency in sequence placement forecloses inaction with legible relief cost in lifted weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Patterns' fragility emerges via ritual failure to fulfillment, reweighting curse's "shape without why" in final exhale without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature on unseen (eels as "living shadows"); rhythmic modulation accelerates from observation to thrum-climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image (star dust swirling "like iron to a lodestone"); varied rhythm propels without loops or figurative muddle in peak placement beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eel guardians carrying shard synthesize curse-promise into inevitable mend; transforms unraveling trope via grounded ritual without retreat.</comment>
