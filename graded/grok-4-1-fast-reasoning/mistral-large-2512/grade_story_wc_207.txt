<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's petrichor collection and psychometry reveal particular traits through concrete actions like vial uncorking, earning the final acceptance with embodied prickle and hitch. Internal conflict layers curiosity against fear in the descent's "skin prickle." Minor slip: climax realization feels more epiphanic than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (petrichor musk to pulsing water) builds to CR closure: vial hums as "promise," reweighting earth's awakening with conceptual cost of silenced machines. Orientation anchors early via valley and cliffs. No causality breaks; pattern taught from opener.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Calcite walls and warm lagoon constrain via compass-pointed arch and constrain choice to kneel/dip. Sensory hierarchy (musk, prickle, groan) reflects Elias's priorities. Final mist curling charges image, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe petrichor source) signaled early tightens accumulatively to grandfather's rise narrowing to vial act; agency in uncorking forecloses explanation with felt hum-cost. Escalation via deepening revelations under lens; visible price in earth's "held breath" stir.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory/awakening emerges via particulars (factory hush heralds lagoon), final vial seals non-literal answer reweighting petrichor as "world waking up." Subtext in reaching hands implies taken expedition's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("stone remembering water") modulates rhythm under stress to short gasps at surface break. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "groan of hinged awakenings."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors like "broken teeth" purposeful without muddle. Minor overwrite in "shattered moon" but supports atmosphere. No loops; propulsion clear to humming vial.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, petrichor-as-breath, and transformed grandfather transforms cave trope into inevitable CR. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
