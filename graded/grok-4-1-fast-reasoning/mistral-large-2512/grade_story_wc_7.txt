<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in tasting memories intensifies through tending and culminates in earned vision of mother's kitchen; embodied emotion peaks in "gasping on the greenhouse floor." Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing ("proving that even in ruins, there was still room for gentleness") hedges contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from planting to unnatural growth and vision; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise in pocketing seeds) lands on-page with felt emotional cost in the fading vision. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/seed; time jumps legible via "days passed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse vividly integrated, constraining choices via "pruning the overgrowth" and mirroring internal decay/healing; sensory hierarchy (damp soil, humming air) reflects chef's priorities. Greenhouse charges final image as "sanctuary" and "beginning."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grow healing fruit) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sprout/ripening, but escalation mild with low visible trade-offs; agency in infusing memories, cost felt obliquely in trembling hands rather than foreclosing a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing ruins emerges organically from seed-to-fruit arc and memory infusion, reweighting premise in final pouch image without moralizing; synaptic plasticity subtly ties particulars to resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tasting/growth metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates from tense planting ("breath held") to expansive vision. No dialogue; diction controlled and biased toward sensory memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful images (iridescent leaves, swirling fruit); minor repetition of "quiet" (understanding, moments, certainty, strength) creates subtle motif without loop. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and synaptic fruit transforms post-ruin tropes; "knowledge fruit seed" offers non-obvious angle on healing, inevitable in hindsight via chef's gift.</comment>
