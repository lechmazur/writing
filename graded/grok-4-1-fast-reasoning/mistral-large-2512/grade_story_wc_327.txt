<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to capture texture rooted in pattern-seeing shines in starling analogy and diamond use; interiority concrete and embodied in trembling hands at climax. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—steady competence without deep struggle lowers from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: echo density builds to diamond storm (RR/Charged Poise) with legible cost in trembling hands and post-capture silence. Single scene anchored early (~50 words); closure reconfigures curse to vessel without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and tunnel constrain choices (tracing walls, amplification forces precision); final silent canyon charges image as unchanged witness to reconfiguration. Sensory hierarchy (texture primacy) filters through Elara's bias, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture texture) signaled early, tightens via echoes answering her hum—forces conducting with pulse/heat cost. Textural escalation decisive; protagonist agency shapes flock-pattern guidance into payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of language death yielding sensory new form emerges organically from diamond vessel and final smile; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars (texture, patterns) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (texture metaphors: sandstone, leaves); rhythmic prose modulates to hum's low steady. No head-hopping; diction fits questing scholar.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to climax; metaphors coherent (flock, shepherd) without muddle. Minor density in opening reflections, but no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed diamond as echo-vessel and bone-tower textures transforms tropes; bird patterns heighten ingenuity without gimmick. Risky lyric texture feels inevitable to closure.</comment>
