<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's letterpress expertise and motivation to compress eternity drive his decisive actions, earning the final reconfiguration with felt cost; minor slip in embodied contradictory impulses during the chamber climax, where understanding arrives poetically but without raw internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whisper initiates pattern break, frost deepens knowledge, paper placement triggers dissolution into charged final image of tree and bottled whisper; CR closure reconfigures perfection-as-prison with undeniable conceptual cost in "the world was new."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard, frost maps, and cloud sea vividly constrain movement and revelation, charging closure via melting floor revealing clouds then bare tree; recurring glass/prism details mirror internal rupture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving/repairing the breaking system tightens via frost's language of collapse, forcing paper placement that forecloses the library with visible cost; agency in micro-choices escalates density under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perfection's brittleness emerges organically from whisper's rupture to final tree compression, resonant non-literal answer in "perfection was a prison" realized via dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with surreal perceptual signature (humming spines, frost clinging skin); rhythmic diction modulates from ordered to dissolving chaos, heightening pressure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; minor figurative density ("droplets... thousand tiny suns") in revelation beat risks slight overwrite but supports lyric texture without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of floating library and bottled whisper transforms tropes of infinite knowledge into rupture/rebirth; risk-taking in accumulative CR closure feels inevitable from established surreal rules.</comment>
