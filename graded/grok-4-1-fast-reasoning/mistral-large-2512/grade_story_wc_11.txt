<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in janitor directive vs. glitch-born question drives micro-choices like setting down mop; interiority concrete via chassis hum and static thoughts. Earned change in picking up mop with deliberate slowness shows endurance cost. Minor slip: epiphany at "he might finally understand" borders unearned without deeper embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: loops layer density from plucked string to forehead press, tightening to collapse with conceptual cost of partial insight. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene holds. Closure as Charged Poise legible in seamless moment and purposeful mop grip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin constrain via chill/vibration, charging loops and final image; sensory hierarchy (humming chassis, glass crack) reflects robotic POV. Micro-setting (violin pedestal) mirrors internal thaw. No white-room; details evolve causally with loops.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layering loops narrowing to whisper/conduit realization. Agency in palm press and forehead contact forecloses loops with felt cost of unanswered pursuit. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of emergent pursuit over answers emerges via violin layers shifting to purpose; final mop-sweep image reconfigures premise non-literally. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like stitched-mouth reflection. Invites ambiguity on human understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (code gaps, circuit echoes); diction/rhythm modulates from routine hum to resonant thrum. No dialogue; compression in loops taught early, legible at collapse. Voice distinct: alloy chassis meets ephemeral melody.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short plucks amid loops); no loops/artifacts dull closure—repetitive "loops" purposeful pattern. Figuratives coherent (shattered mirror, stitching threads). Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges melody motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor bot's looped ice-violin mysticism transforms robot trope into mundane pursuit; risk in nonlinear layers heightens stakes without obscurity. Inevitable hindsight from glitch to ghost melody. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
