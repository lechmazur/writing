<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via gardener metaphors like "coax roses from stubborn soil," with motivation rooted in tending dead; earned realization at closure ("echoes... his, too") shows change with felt cost of longing. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding threads builds density to CR closure ("listens to the uncharted echoes and let them shape his own intentions") with legible conceptual cost of personal longing. Orientation anchored early ("cobalt silo... Elias tended to the dead"); one tightening via gold threads suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo walls and niches constrain choices (blue thread to Margaret's box); recurring objects like tapestry charge final image. Sensory selection purposeful (damp earth, river mud lapping "like a cat at a saucer"); POV bias filters via gardener lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover intentions) signaled early, tightens texturally via thread discoveries narrowing to personal echo; agency in following paths forecloses isolation with cost of realized longing. One deepening at gold initials suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lingering life-threads emerges organically from particulars (frayed knots to M.V.+J.H.); final image reweights premise non-literally ("shape his own intentions") without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on echoes' mutuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (roots, roses); rhythmic control modulates from humming calm to reflective poise. Lyrical diction purposeful, biased via gardener worldview; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punches like "Wait for me where the water bends"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Figurative language purposeful (velveteen gloom) without overwriting in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery tending as decoding human intentions via threads transforms trope of ghostly echoes; risk in textural drive heightens closure's inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
