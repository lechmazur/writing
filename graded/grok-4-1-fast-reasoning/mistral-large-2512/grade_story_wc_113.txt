<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to unravel the code roots in musician curiosity, intensifying through embodied actions like brushing water and grasping violin; interiority concrete in breaths hitching and fingers finding strings by instinct. Internal drive shows via hesitation before wading, balancing caution against compulsion. Final play as endurance forecloses silence with felt isolation cost; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in peak, but change earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (ripples to faces, ink rivulets to notes) narrows to violin grasp shifting space. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (bassoon case, opera house threshold). Closure as CR: "program now blank, its secrets spent" reweights lost music premise with conceptual cost of disruption, legible in trembled house and vanished Elias.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains via wading cold and floating violin, charging final "water stilled" image; lanterns flicker shapes into sensory hierarchy (visual distortions, tactile seep). Details POV-filtered (musician notes numbers as "notes"); evolves causally from still to swirling dancers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel/play lost music) signaled via program, tightens accumulatively when water rearranges notes and space warps to in-between. Agency in raising violin forecloses non-disruption path; cost felt in trembled house, alone in dark. Escalation coherent under lens without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of waiting music/disrupted silence emerges via water images shifting to dancers at play; final blank program reconfigures "unstruck chords" motif without statement. Resonance from particulars (Elias's smile before vanish) lingers ambiguity of loss regained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with musician perceptual signature (ink "bleeding like tears," air "hum of string before bow"). Rhythm modulates tension via short sentences in shift ("The water shifted."); purposeful compression in surreal warp legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "ripples spread outward, distorting light into shapes—faces, hands"); rhythm varies read-aloud, accelerating to "first note shattered." No loops; metaphors coherent (water "asking," walls "labyrinth").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: water as oracle revealing sheet-music code transforms haunted opera trope via musician logic. Risk in surreal in-between pays off at charged closure; no close famous echoes.</comment>
