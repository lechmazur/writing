<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied details like "knees popping like distant thunder" and needle as utility relic ground consistent motivation to distill essence; endurance in storm earns quiet gratitude without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (fog to slashing rain) builds to Charged Poise closure; "for the first time in years, he felt no weight" lands reconfiguration with endured storm cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound river and fraying rope constrain stitching choice early; recurring gutters ticking evolve causally to mirror internal distillation, charging final emergence of bank as revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rope fraying and rain escalation deepen dominant stake of crossing under frayed duty; one tightening via stitching forecloses unraveling option with bodily cost in swaying ferry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Palimpsest layers and needle reprise reweight loss into essence without statement; final "spindrift serenity" offers non-literal answer to distillation question via endured chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (ambient signs over sight) modulates rhythmically; syntax like "the rain slashing at the fog until the other bank emerged like a revelation" heightens under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (whisper drops to drumbeat); minor figurative density ("tea leaves steeping") purposeful but risks muddle in stitching beat, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ferryman distilling storm via needle transforms solitary endurance trope; fresh "palimpsest" frame on routine crossing feels organic to voice without hedging.</comment>
