<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's belief in living stories drives concrete micro-choices like draping the scarf, earning a shift from solitude to connection with embodied cost in the tightening scarf; woman remains archetypal but secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scarf accumulates density to portal crossing, delivering Charged Poise closure in the snap back where scarf's warmth legibly reconfigures tethering cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library's elastic shelves and star-strewn void constrain the threshold choice and charge the final image; scents and textures filter via Elias's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find stories' place tightens accumulatively through scarf's vibration narrowing to void entry; clock strike forces return trade-off with legible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Analog memories as connective threads emerge organically via scarf's evolution, with final warmth offering resonant reconfiguration of isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in geometric poetics like "equations rhymed with elegies"; rhythm modulates seamlessly to charged void.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but dense figuratives like "angles bent like reeds" border overwriting in transition without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry portal via poetry-science scarf synthesis transforms portal trope into inevitable quest payoff, risking bold conceptual fusion.</comment>
