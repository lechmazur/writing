<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices (finding key, descending ladder despite disbelief, handing over tag) reveal hierarchy of values under mystery pressure, earning legacy realization with relational cost. Woman's arrival applies targeted pressure mirroring his ache. Minor slip: shared "hollow ache" eyes feels stock, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: key-book-woman-vision accumulate density to CR closure where handing key reconfigures legacy with conceptual debt cost ("a debt, a legacy"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; shards legible via purposeful wandering. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final hand-brush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library's algae rungs, salt-paper air, porthole beam constrain descent/discovery and charge color-vision climax. Lantern glow seeping through portholes mirrors internal shift tactilely. Sensory hierarchy lamplighter-specific (light flicker, gas flames).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key's meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ship book to woman's truth-challenge to vision, narrowing solitary denial. Agency in following/handing key forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (light as binding vows/legacy) emerges via particulars: key-Lumen book-sky colors, reweighted non-literally in "color of sound" realization without moral. Final hand-brush offers resonant answer to hiding-behind-truth question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with lamplight perceptual bias ("flick of wick," "light bent"); dialogue subtextual ("You're late—for the truth"). Rhythm modulates to hushed intensity at lantern rise. No head-hopping; woman's brief idiom distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: "ladder slick with algae, rungs groaning" advances setting/action/pressure in one line. Varied rhythm peaks propulsively at "Red for toll... Gold for promises." Zero loops/artifacts; no figurative muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Color of sound" via bent lantern light transforms lamplighter trope into fresh luminous-vow legacy. Risky CR closure via synesthetic image feels inevitable from key-seed. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual shift heightens stakes.</comment>
