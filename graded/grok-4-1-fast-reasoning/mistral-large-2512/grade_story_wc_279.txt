<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's social perceptiveness and motivation to find patterns shine in embodied reactions like stomach clench and trembling hands, earning her final press into the sand. Maren applies targeted pressure as ex-archivist, forcing a pivot from arranging to listening. Minor slip: epiphany at "You see it now" feels slightly told before fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist, flakes, and shifting mandala builds to Charged Poise closure where lines glow after stillness, reweighting the unlearning's pretense with conceptual cost of remembered secrets. Orientation anchors early (Liora in grotto during unlearning). One tightening via tile flake ripple suffices; cost legible in "throat tight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tile flake recurs to constrain choice (settles, pulses, pressed) and charges final glow image. Lilac mist and humming tiles filter through Liora's perceptual bias, evolving causally (swirls thick). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under unease, mirroring internal chaos without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning from chaos) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via mandala ripple and emergent pressure heard in ribs, narrowing to endurance via listening. Final press forecloses wrong path (arranging) with embodied cost (trembling). Agency in persistence and nod; Maren's interjection complicates coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance amid unlearning emerges organically from particulars like shifting echoes spelling unsaid regrets. Final glow offers resonant reconfiguration: hush swells full, reweighting pretense without moral. Subtext in Maren's "listening" indirection enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable Liora POV with perceptual signature (reads mist moods like slumps). Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically, compressing under stress ("throat tight"). Dialogue distinct/subtextual: Maren's curt "listening" vs. Liora's defensive "sand doesn’t lie"; tags clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (advance atmosphere/action). Rhythm varies (short peak sentences like "The mandala stilled."). Minor figurative density in opening metaphors (spectral confetti, broken promise) borders overwrite but patterns taught; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unlearning season and emergent hush synthesize fresh premise on collective forgetting via grotto physics. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in glowing closure; irreplaceable tile/mandala logic transforms whisper trope organically.</comment>
