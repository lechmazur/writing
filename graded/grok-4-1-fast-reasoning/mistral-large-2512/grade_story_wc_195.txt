<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric's withdrawal and pull to possibility motivate the sword-drop pivot cleanly, with embodied tension in "breath hitched" and heart "drumbeat." Woman's pressure forces micro-choice revealing values. Minor cliché in drumbeat embodiment prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via pulsing fruits to program's dissolution and marionette surge, landing Charged Poise RR in final image with cost legible in "clattered against the stones, the sound echoing like a death knell." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard's fogged panes, groaning branches, and twisting geometries constrain the surrender, charging final light-swallow. Sensory hierarchy (light pulses mirroring inner pull) POV-filtered perfectly. No white-room; evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (possibility's shape) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via woman's grip and marionette vision narrowing to trade-off. Agency in unsnapping forecloses knight life with on-page cost; pressure coheres to end without resolution coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance to dance over puppet emerges organically via program whispers shifting to final glowing line, reweighting premise without statement. Final image resonates as non-literal answer to control vs. unraveling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in silent, tactile pulls ("program grew warm"). Dialogue subtextual ("You want to capture..."); diction/rhythm modulate tension purposefully. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive, varying syntax; density high without loops. Figurative density peaks slightly overwrought in "leaves skittering over graves," docking prose in high-pressure reveal (-0.4). Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical reality-thin and marionette fate-weaving transforms knight trope via "unsnapping" premise. Bold risk in mystical stutter pays off in charged closure; inevitable hindsight from early program seed.</comment>
