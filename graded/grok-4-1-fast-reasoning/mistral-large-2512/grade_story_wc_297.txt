<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in tracing leaf veins and scar, rooting motivation in visionary tether with embodied fear-hope; final belief earned by prior pulses. Minor slip: woman's sudden arrival underdeveloped as crucible despite pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from glade whispers to star-strewn plain RR/Charged Poise closure, with clipping pulse as tightening; cost legible in "world tilted" and unknown vastness. Orientation anchored early; single scene holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's twisted trees and dew-damp clipping constrain choices (plucked from heart, clutched tight) and charge final dissolution image. Sensory hierarchy (ozone smell, humming air) reflects Elias's bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remake covenant at intersection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visions to her brush triggering tilt; agency in heeding forecloses isolation with felt unknown cost. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remaking fractured dreams emerges via scarred tether and clipping key, resonant in final "together" reweighting without moral; ambiguity lingers in vast plain's promise-peril.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (visions bleeding into soil); lyrical diction modulates rhythm under rising elation. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You've come").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; minor metaphor density ("bruise deepening," "ink into parchment") coherent without muddle. Slight repetition ("anxious elation") nudges down but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of topiary key and eclipsed covenant transforms dream-trope via scarred linking; bold glade-to-plain shift inevitable from particulars, risks fantasy without gimmick.</comment>
