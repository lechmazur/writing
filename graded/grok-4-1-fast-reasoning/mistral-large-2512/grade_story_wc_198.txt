<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Earned endurance in playing until lungs burn compels the renunciation of full silencing, with motivation rooted in grandmother's melody and lifelong deciphering. Interiority concrete via embodied reed tremble and splintered bone memory. No strong simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whisper to echoes and mist shapes, cadence shift as mist lifts dissolves prophecy. Charged Poise closure legible in lighter case and released hum, with felt cost ("something taken from him"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Biomescent moss, wet earth scent, and prismatic shadows constrain play and mirror internal hush, charging final drip image. Sensory hierarchy musical (reed dewdrops, pulsing light with breath). Grotto evolves causally with mist thickening then lifting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early tightens via echoes and faces in mist forcing sustained play to dissolution. Agency in negative-space shaping forecloses noise-drowning with lung-burn cost. No live option fully closed earlier pulls from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silencing past via art emerges organically from melody absorption and kept silences, with final hum reweighting prophecy's persistence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in return inevitability. Faces in mist yield earned dramatic irony without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias (mist curling ankles, notes as whispers), rhythmic modulation peaks in burning lungs beat. Stable single POV; purposeful compression taught early pays in closure poise. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies from long mist swirls to short drip finality. Figurative coherent (spectral shards, rainbow shadows) without muddle, pattern-taught via light motifs. Minor density drag in reflective opener but no loops or closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Saxophone prophecy-hushing via negative space transforms musician trope into eerie musical ritual. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, with mist-grotto synthesis heightening stakes. Non-obvious code-in-melody angle fresh.</comment>
