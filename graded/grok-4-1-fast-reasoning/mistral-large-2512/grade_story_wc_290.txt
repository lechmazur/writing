<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely from the start ("fingers digging into the cold metal... vision blurred") and resolved with earned cost at closure ("claustrophobia forgotten"), compelling the final grasp; motivation rooted in years of fragments drives prudent risks. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses pre-take (hesitation brief, not agonized) prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain (entry → hum → approach → encounter → grasp → shift) under Causal lens holds to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "once you see the truth, you can’t unsee it" and star-map image reconfiguring the premise. Orientation anchored early ("bowels of the Nexus... fallow period").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective ("starlight... painted silver veins," "damp stone and old parchment") constrains via claustrophobia and guides approach ("pulling him deeper into the shadows"); final stars-as-map charges closure image directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover spatial mutiny key) signaled early, escalates via swelling hum/tremble to figure confrontation narrowing options; agency in "reached out" and grasp forecloses ignorance with irreversible cost under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of spatial mutiny as "freedom" emerges organically from events/dialogue without statement; final "stars... were a map" offers resonant non-literal reweighting of premise, embracing ambiguity over tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (claustrophobia filters space); voice textured and rhythmic ("notes curled around him"), dialogue subtextual ("The Nexus was never meant to be fixed. It was meant to *move*.") advances revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The hum... swelled... teeth ache"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors ("warping like heat off desert sand") support atmosphere without muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ruin-as-dimensional-ship premise transformed via architect's compass and mutiny redefinition feels inevitable; risk in impossible geometries/geometries pays off in charged CR closure.</comment>
