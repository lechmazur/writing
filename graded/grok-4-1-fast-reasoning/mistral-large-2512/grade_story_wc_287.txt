<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exchange of gauge compels higher-stakes choice rooted in Elias's traits, earning change with relational cost; embodied emotion in dirt under nails and Lila's trembling voice. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening via Lila's arrival and key reveal; closure as CR in "world shifted, just a little" reconfigures endings with conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor's "rippling like liquid silver" and fire escape's "skeletal metal frame" constrain reflective choices and charge final lantern reflection; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sustaining beauty amid endings signaled early, deepens via Lila's news forcing gauge exchange that forecloses Elias's personal relic with felt relational cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of endings as disguised beginnings emerges organically from rosebush, key, and gauge exchange; final image offers resonant CR reweighting prior loss without moralizing, though gated by Q2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in tactile details like thorns and worn key; dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re still here"), distinguishing voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in key beats; minor overwriting in "liquid silver" ripples but no loops obscure closure image of lantern glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardening/locksmith legacy transforms loss trope; key exchange turn feels inevitable from established particulars without template echoes.</comment>
