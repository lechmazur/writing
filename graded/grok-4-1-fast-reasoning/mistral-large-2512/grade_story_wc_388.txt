<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to debunk myths drives consistent micro-choices like piecing letters, with embodied tension (numb fingers, pulse quickening); stranger adds pressure via shifting allegiance. Internal conflict emerges in realizing the liquidation cover-up, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Strong endurance at closure, but minor stock debunker archetype limits to strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens: letter reassembly (because) prompts stranger's arrival (therefore), leading to stillpoint reveal; single scene anchors early (orchard, respirator). Closure as CR via diamond lens with conceptual cost ("government had lied... bury that knowledge"). Tightening at "They sent you" reversal narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard details (glowing fruit, spongy soil, pulsing roots) constrain via radiation/respirator wear and charge final "warm, alive" soil image. Sensory hierarchy (dust swirl, boot crunch) filters through Elias's observant bias, mirroring internal defiance. Environment guides to clearing, enabling diamond payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose stillpoint truth) signaled early, tightens causally via letters to stranger confrontation, forcing alliance choice. Escalation driven by agency (piecing, confronting); cost legible in "before they do" danger charging closure. Minor abstract stakes early slightly mutes visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth/healing amid lies emerges via orchard's defiance and diamond CR, reweighting premise without statement. Subtext in stranger's exhaustion implies shared cost; final image answers "cursed" myth non-literally. Resonant but ambiguity leans simplistic counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (observant patterns in shreds, dust silhouettes). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Didn't think you'd piece it together so fast"), advances plot; rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences at crunch). Minor expository interiority at realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (breath fogging mask during piecing); varied rhythm accelerates to "A sound cut through the wind." No loops/artifacts; strong verbs (crouched, exhaled, clutched). Minor telling in "Elias’s mind raced" but doesn't dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thriving orchard as healing proof subverts wasteland trope, with diamond-as-lens ingenuity organic to observant debunker. Risk in late ally twist pays off causally; memorable perceptual angle on radiation defiance. Minor familiar conspiracy beats temper boldness.</comment>
