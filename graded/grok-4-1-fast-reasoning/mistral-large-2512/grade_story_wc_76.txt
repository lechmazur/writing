<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like varying yoyo drops; interiority concrete via tactile sensations (thumb on grooves, gears like vertebrae). Final change earned by escalating tests on stone, feeling time as choice. Lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: yoyo reverse-engineered → dropped variably → stone splits → world reverses. Closure as CR in "world *reversed*... time not as a chain, but as a choice," with cost in silence and backward beam. Orientation anchored early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (salt corroding brass, kelp-slick rocks) constrains low-tide access to stone. Lighthouse beam and stone charge final image, mirroring reversal. POV bias shapes notice of latent hum particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (step beyond fate) signaled early, tightens via yoyo ascents to hover/unwind before stone. Agency in deliberate drops forecloses normal gravity/path with reversal cost. Escalation driven by causal tests under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reversing fate emerges organically from radiance motif shifting meaning. Final image ("yoyo fell. But the hunger stone remembered") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Counter-readings linger in bleak exhilaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in inventive phrasing ("counter-clockwise persuasion," "tide’s slow exhale"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax ("gears... spun wildly"). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; metaphors consistent (light "color of old bruises"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak "stone split open" beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with reversal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: yoyo gears reversing gravity/time on hunger stone transforms fate trope. Risky backward beam closure feels inevitable from clockmaker setup. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
