<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (restlessness under waxing gibbous); motivation to preserve wonder drives micro-choices like reading aloud, earning final release; contradictory impulses (routine vs. smelting urge) act in scene, with closure renunciation visible in adrift creel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via book-reading/filling, pattern break (creel "not empty"), Charged Poise RR at release reconfigures preservation with felt cost of letting go; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt exhales, moon-bleeding light, tide lapping brass toes) constrains choices (anchored gears, water's edge); recurring water ripples/ glow charges final cathedral image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder amid future-less routine) signaled early, textural deepening via creel-filling narrows to release trade-off; agency in adrifting forecloses hoarding path, cost felt in "enough"; minor abstractness in stakes pre-creel slips high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of accepting contradictions emerges organically via book/creel vessels; final image (creel vanishing) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting migrating stories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (moon-pull attunement, sea-as-giant); rhythmic prose modulates serenity-to-release without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud test passes), purposeful figures ("sea breathed," "ink bleeding") coherent in peak filling beat; zero loops, propulsion integrates image/action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan-gear lib, soul-books, post-tomorrow atrium transforms tropes; creel-release turn inevitable from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
