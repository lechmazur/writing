<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied regret (e.g., "salt in his beard and regret in his bones") drive micro-choices like the lunge for the shell; final renunciation earned by accumulating discoveries with visible cost in trembling hands. Contradictory impulses act in panic-to-understanding arc without epiphanies. No slips touch closure painting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density to CR closure ("paint... the space between them... forgiveness") with conceptual cost of irrecoverable youth legible in blank canvas "Remember." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via shell's sink suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via slick walls, rippling pool, submerged ledge shaping pursuits; charges closure with tunnel paintings mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy painterly (phosphorescent pulses like heartbeats). Micro-setting (shell, canvas) indispensable to image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through shell's elusion and paintings' revelation narrowing to forgiveness; cost felt in foreclosed reclamation. Protagonist agency in wrong turn and lunge drives under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's irrecoverability emerges organically from shell-promise to "Remember" canvas; final image reconfigures as forgiveness without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with painterly perceptual signature (e.g., colors vibrant despite decades); rhythmic control modulates from exploration to charged poise. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with propulsion (varied syntax, e.g., short exhales amid long traces). Figuratives integrated (tunnel "sloped downward like a sigh") without muddle. Peak closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cave as "threshold" transforms nostalgia trope via older stranger paintings and blank "Remember"; risk in lyric CR closure inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
