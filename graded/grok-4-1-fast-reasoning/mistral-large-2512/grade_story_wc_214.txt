<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find strength in vulnerability is embodied in his chest ache mirroring the star's longing, driving micro-choices like grabbing the glass; internal contradiction between janitor duties and seeking shines in polishing lenses "no one would ever use again." Final shift to witness feels earned without unearned epiphany. Minor telling of motivation late slightly limits perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to star flicker and glass glow, culminating in CR closure where station reframes as "beginning" with cost of prior unnoticed life legible in trembling fingers and warm glass. Orientation anchored early in station and Elias's role. One tightening at alarms suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station and yellow glass as micro-settings constrain choices—glass "remembers" star, charging final hum; sensory details (ozone, parchment) filter through Elias's priorities, mirroring internal hush. Details evolve with star's arc, avoiding static backdrop; glass in pocket recharges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking cosmic connection tightens texturally at star sighting, forcing empathy and glass-tracing that forecloses janitor stasis with felt ache cost; agency in deliberate arc observation narrows to witness reconfiguration. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability's strength emerges organically from star as "offering" and Elias's reflection in its descent, resonant in final glass hum reweighting prior labor without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "thread" he held, inviting reflection via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of cosmic whispers and fractured light; voice modulates rhythmically from hush to deepening night, diction biased toward unseen potentials. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure image; no head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath—short alarms pierce long silences; high density integrates action, image, interiority without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (shattered constellation) consistent and purposeful in accumulative texture, though dense opening risks slight overwrites; closure propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise transforms isolation trope via glass relic and empathic star arc, fresh synthesis of stillness as flourishing force; risk in primal lyricism heightens stakes of unnoticed witness, inevitable in hindsight via threaded path image.</comment>
