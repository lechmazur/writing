<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation rooted in navigation expertise intensifies through experiments, compelling tool-forging; contradictory wariness vs curiosity embodied in visor-tracking nights. Tael's skepticism forces micro-choice defense, altering group stance. Final endurance of deep limits earned by sighting realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of failures builds density to ship-sighting pattern break ("its path aligning with the star"), cadence-shifting CR closure ("time to expand") reconfigures horizons with conceptual cost of abandoning seabed ways. Mosaic shards (plain, observatory, weeks, sighting, return) taught early via salvaging cue, transitions legible; orientation anchored by word 50.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Benthic details (pressure-forged alloys, silt-buried chain, thermal vents) selectively narrow perception under deep urgency; chain as micro-setting constrains forging choices and charges final image ("its weight familiar"). Sensory hierarchy reflects instructor bias toward currents/tools; spatial choreography coherent across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation) signaled early, tightens via sighting reversal changing knowledge/options under accumulative lens; Tael's scoff adds coherent pressure, protagonist agency in experiments/endurance forecloses old-path limits with felt expansion cost at "promise of something greater."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of horizons emerges from chain's evolution (relic to star-tool), subtext in wary curiosity vs elder doubt; final image non-literally answers deep/star divide, reweighting premise via stars-as-language without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (light-currents bias: "edge geometry still held true") biases details; dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (Lirien's "paths can be followed" persuades, Tael concedes). Rhythmic modulation accelerates in sighting beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels (opening "corpse of coral and steel" vivid anchor); minor figurative stack in observatory ("hummed with tension... salt and ozone") lacks payoff but doesn't dull closure. No loops; varied syntax breathes with experimentation shards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: surface anchor repurposed for star-lenses via edge geometry transforms deep-sea tropes; risk in mosaic time-jumps heightens ingenuity, inevitable at chain's final heft.</comment>
