<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's methodically playful trait drives contradictory impulses—restoring certainty versus probing "what ifs"—culminating in an earned realization at the fourth awakening where certainty is exchanged. Interiority is embodied through vibrations in bones and breath fogging glass. Final choice to engage the nickel reveals values hierarchy with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nested awakenings build density from soot brush to trumpet lifting, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing where mural becomes door. Causality links actions (picking nickel) to escalations (dishes spinning). Orientation anchored early (Elias on scaffold by cathedral); cost legible in "he had come to restore certainty—but the mural had other plans."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden and nickel constrain choices—dishes amplify breath, nickel reflects archangel—charging final image. Sensory details (humming clatter, steam-snorting buffalo) filtered via Elias's auditory bias. Spatial choreography coherent: scaffold to garden echo to cracking glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. awakening unknown) signaled early, tightens via four agency-driven awakenings narrowing options to door invitation. Escalation under accumulative lens: density peaks in trumpet's question coiling ribs. Cost unmistakable in hot nickel and foreclosed restoration path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of certainty exchanged for hidden echoes emerges from particulars like nested murals and reflected sounds, reweighted in final CR: "the mural wasn’t a record... but a door." Resonance in archangel's grin via nickel avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: sound-attuned (whispers in pause, tuning forks). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, prose syntax reflects playful mind. No head-hopping; elisions (e.g., awakenings) taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multitask (e.g., "hobo nickel tossed... vanishing into beggar’s palm" evokes motif while propelling). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (Russian dolls nesting murals). Propulsion peaks in "lips parted... tongue a flicker of gold leaf."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound garden + nested murals + hobo nickel transforms restoration trope into sonic door. Risky accumulative awakenings feel inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
