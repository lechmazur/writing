<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in edge-seeking traits drives consistent micro-choices like entering storm; internal conflict via hindsight vs. foresight embodied in dream interpretation. Woman as secondary applies revelatory pressure, altering stance. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("transcend the directive’s decay") slightly undercuts pivotal realization without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (vines, seals, paths) builds to CR closure where key reforms and Elias steps into rain, reweighting premise with endurance cost legible in "the key warm in his palm." Orientation anchored early (bunker, storm by dusk). Single scene with dream shard and forest transition legible; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (ozone, wet earth, vines brushing arms) reflects Elias's priorities; rewilded forest constrains/guides choices (vines direct to woman). Bunker/oak micro-settings charge final image, mirroring internal decay/transcendence. Environment evolution (storm intensifies) causal with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path/walker mystery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream → question → seal-to-key, narrowing to choice realization. Agency in following vines/asking forces trade-off; cost felt in storm endurance charging end. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (choice animates decaying paths) emerges organically from seal motif shift and woman's subtextual dialogue; final key/image reconfigures without moralizing. Complexity in ambiguity ("path seeks you back") lingers post-closure. No thematic echo; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (cracks as maps, paths coiling); voice texture lyrical/ethereal, modulates rhythmically under storm pressure. Dialogue subtextual ("path is alive... its echo"), goal-driven revelation; distinct idioms (woman's wind-like laugh). No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful "path" recurrence pattern-taught without loops. No scaffold/paraphrase in peak beats; metaphors coherent (vines/ro ribs). Minor overwriting in opening descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alive paths/seals in rewilded decay; risk in lyric mysticism heightens stakes via guiding vines. Turns (dream → oak door) inevitable from Elias's edge-drawing. No derivative templates; bold image of reforming wax-key.</comment>
