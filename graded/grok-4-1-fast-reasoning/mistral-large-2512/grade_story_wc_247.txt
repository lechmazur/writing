<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's embodied gestures conducting silence reveal contradictory impulses of ache and soar, earning her final fullness; Elias applies relational pressure via whispers and signing that force micro-choices. Interiority concrete via camera framing and signing fluency. Flawless progression without diagnostic labels, but minor stock phrasing in "heart ached even as it soared."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from framing emptiness to faster gestures pulling sound, landing Charged Poise closure where Lena feels seen with felt cost in "joyful sorrow." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via wind-gust transition to intensified signing. No lens ambiguity or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor's luminous water and salt-wind constrain choices, mirroring internal states through selective sensory hierarchy (lapping waves, distant rain). Camera as micro-setting charges final horizon-pointing image. Vivid integration via POV-filtered reflections; spatial choreography flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) signaled early, tightens via hands "moving faster" reweighting options under Accumulative lens. Agency in signing endurance forecloses isolation path; cost legible in "weight of something unspoken." Minor abstractness in stakes prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-to-music emerges organically via signing patterns shifting to hum; final image reconfigures "forgotten" premise without moralizing. Joyful sorrow as resonant answer to isolation, charged by harbor glow. No tidy binaries or echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in silence-mapping; rhythmic modulation peaks in gesture descriptions. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're disrupting"), advances via Elias's signing. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; syntax varies for lyric rhythm, metaphors coherent (light as "scattered silver," smoke). Purposeful "silence" recurrence taught early without loops. Minor overwriting in repeated light-glow images dulls one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language as composition transforms silence trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes. Camera's no-film constraint and harbor refuge feel inevitable. No derivative templates.</comment>
