<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's pattern-seeing interiority and micro-choices (tracing sextant, following water) root motivation in traits, earning shift to resilience blueprint; embodied emotions contradict (curiosity vs. assignment sting). Woman's presence forces exchange with relational cost. Minor reflection on supervisor feels lightly anchored but tilts present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (sextant, greenery, greenhouse) deepen knowledge toward CR closure—"terminal wasn’t just a ruin. It was a beginning"—repricing decay as potential with conceptual cost of redirected purpose. Orientation anchored early; single scene progression legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spaceport details (collapsed turnstiles, shattered viewport, jury-rigged irrigation) selectively constrain choices (following water path) and charge final image via engineer's mapping of "load-bearing points" mirroring hope's structure. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; greenhouse fogged glass evolves with discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity puzzling hope equations) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing from assessment to blueprint; agency in pursuit forecloses decay-only path. Cost felt in "sextant piece warm against her thigh" crystallizing reconfigured options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via redirection emerges organically from water/plants/sextant particulars, final image offering non-literal answer reweighting premise. Woman's line "Hope isn’t about grand gestures..." borders echo but integrates as earned dialogue under pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (equations in stone, skeletal ambition); voice modulates rhythmically, diction biased toward patterns. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You stayed"), distinguishing voices without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory/action; minor "weight" repetition purposeful (toolbag to sextant). No loops/artifacts dull closure; metaphors coherent (cathedral of dreams mirroring terminal).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport decay post-carnival with sextant-guided resilience transforms tropes; "carnival had left only hours before, its neon residue" infuses ingenuity, risk in stoic sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
