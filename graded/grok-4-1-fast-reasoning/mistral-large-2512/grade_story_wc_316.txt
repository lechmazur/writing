<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's numbness embodied concretely in flickering chest sensation dissolving to void and slick palms, with contradictory hold-back vs. raw lunge impulses acting in the fight scene. Final shift earned via escalating choices under Veyra's pressure, confronting pretense with felt arm burn. Minor therapy-speak in "pretense... I’m broken" line slightly abstracts peak, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sword disarms build density to raw attack tightening, jar reflection anchors causality toward RR closure in "numbness... just one color" realization with canvas cost. Single scene oriented early via dojo platform and dying sun. No orientation debt; final step-off image reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dojo's grooves, ozone/incense, trembling rock constrain fights and final edge-step choice; jar recurs to charge Kael's closing stare. Sensory hierarchy narrows to blade glint and blood pulse under crisis. Body as micro-setting (burning arm) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant numbness stake signaled in opening line, texturally deepens via precise-to-raw attack reversal narrowing options. Veyra's pressure forces agency in micro-choices; pretense confrontation bears visible cost in gasp and arm burn charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opposites/pain-as-canvas theme emerges organically via jar backstory and fight progression, reweighted non-literally in "numbness... canvas" realization. Subtext in Veyra's "vivify" gesture invites ambiguity on self without moralizing. Directness of "Opposites define each other" line tempers peak resonance slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in Kael's feet-watching and void-sensing; rhythmic compression in fights ("blur... clattering"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Veyra's "fight" orders pressure). Distinct voices: Veyra's curt vs. Kael's internal churn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerating in strikes ("crack... heat, into pressure"); no loops or scaffolds. Concrete images like "silent scream trapped in glass" propel without overwriting. Final "fly or fall" line recharges opening step-on anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone-jar witness and dojo duels transforms ego-death trope into numbness-canvas arc. Risky philosophical fight integrates organically, with trembling dojo heightening stakes. No derivative echoes; step-off charged poise feels inevitable.</comment>
