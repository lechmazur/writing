<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's envy and longing drive descent and challenge credibly, with micro-choices like pressing glass revealing isolation; contradictory impulses surface in envying Kael while hearing voices affirm his destiny. Final leadership shift earned via accumulated whispers, but embodied emotions lean metaphoric over tactile specifics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: radio voices → glass visions → descent → crowd-turning DC, with legible cost in Kael's falter and wavering allegiance. Orientation anchors early at observatory; single transition to valley coherent, closure charged without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glass constrains visions and mental flare at climax, charging final image; storm sensory hierarchy narrows to wind/static amid crisis, mirroring internal storm. Spatial choreography clear from domes to slippery descent to platform push.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rivalry stake signaled early tightens causally to confrontation reversal, narrowing options via shadows display; agency in descent/raise crystallizes stance, cost visible in crowd gasp and Kael crack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Allegiance as crucible emerges implicitly from fickle crowd shift via shadows over charisma, reweighting prophetic validity without moral; final image resonates as earned reconfiguration of leadership.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias-biased perception of whispers/shadows; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, dialogue sparse but subtext-driven (Kael's "Behold!" vs Elias's claim).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors advancing atmosphere, varied syntax propels to closure; minor opening figurative density risks overwrought but pattern-taught and untouching peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio ghosts and glass portico transforms prophet rivalry trope organically; risk in mystical confrontation pays off in inevitable crowd turn from particulars.</comment>
