<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via recalled training; embodied contradiction peaks in "pang of joy mixed with sorrow, an anguished joy that filled his chest." Micro-choices like irregular steps reveal values under pressure. Minor abstract labels like "steadily unpredictable" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to pattern break, yielding CR closure as "light touched his skin... pulling him into a vortex" reconfigures soul with emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in corridor/archive. Single scene fits scope; cost legible in surrendered rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pagoda and archive vividly constrain approach via encoded patterns; sensory hierarchy (scent, hum, light) filters through historian's priorities. Details evolve causally with steps. Pagoda charges final shimmer image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock via anti-pattern) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via irregular cadence, heavy air, descending light tightens to transformation. Agency in steps forecloses rhythmic certainty with felt pang. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of purification-through-unpredictability emerges organically from mosaic past and final "dance of randomness"; resonant CR reweights pattern-safety without moralizing. Particulars like fluttering pages avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "mosaic of broken beats"; rhythmic prose mirrors anti-pattern theme, modulating purposefully. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density but overwriting in peak—"cascade of light descended like liquid memory, each ray carrying a whisper"—muddles with stacked figures; minor loops on "atoms of nostalgia" and "anguished joy." Rhythm varies well overall, propulsion strong until end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms forbidden-knowledge trope via pattern-avoidance mechanics and "atoms of nostalgia"; bold lyric risk heightens cosmic echo in final steps without gimmickry.</comment>
