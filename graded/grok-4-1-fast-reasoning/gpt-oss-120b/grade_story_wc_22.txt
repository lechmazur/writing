<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in ancestral training compels concrete micro-choices like whispering glyphs and releasing pods, with embodied interiority in tongue-shaping and weight on timber; final smile earns change as weight of ancestors lifts, showing hierarchy of values. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits from perfect 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bird trills triggering pod releases to shoots emerging, culminating in Charged Poise RR where garden's breath reconfigures war's scars with conceptual cost of reef's death legible in horizon fade and final whisper. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jetty's narrow timber sighs and wind-kissed ferns constrain scattering and charge final phosphorescent glow; sensory hierarchy (bird calls over surf, pollen in breeze) reflects coachman's priestly focus, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism. Evolving details like algae integrate purposefully into climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fertilize via birds/dead languages) signaled early, deepens via successive trills narrowing decoding options under Accum lens; agency in listening/whispering forecloses doubt with felt cost of war's ash in sprout-tremble. Atmospheric pressure strong but lacks visceral trade-off in pivotal pod releases.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through lost tongues emerges organically from bird-seed concord, reweighted in final image of jetty as "ribbon of hope" answering battlefield reclamation without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in reef's unhealable wound embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (glyph-sounds, bird cadences) stable in close third POV; rhythm modulates from listening hush to heartbeat drum, with purposeful compression teaching poetic pattern paid in closure image. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short trills vs. flowing whispers); metaphors cohere (pods as "pale scrolls," shoots as "prayer flags") without muddle in peak scattering beat. Minor purple edges in repeated "narrow vastness" motif purposeful but slightly scaffold-like.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual gardener decoding birds in post-reef warscape transforms renewal tropes; "submerged concord" turn inevitable from established ancestral pattern, with bold lyric risk heightening stakes in final heart-image.</comment>
