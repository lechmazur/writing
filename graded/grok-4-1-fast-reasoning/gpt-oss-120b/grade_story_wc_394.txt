<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's steadily curious trait drives micro-choices like whispering the joke amid yearning desperation, revealing contradictory mischievous impulses in the "grinding... coffee" line; final laugh earns a credible endurance of the ongoing chase with felt prank-cost on fate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as kaleidoscopic shards densify into vector toward bell; closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in algorithm's "swelling with satisfaction" and prism-map reconfiguration, with conceptual cost of endless ledger legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acid sea hisses pressure choices via transliteration; kaleidoscope as micro-setting constrains navigation in pivotal "rewrite the navigation code" beat and charges final constellation-map, filtering through Mara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring unheard bell) signaled early, tightens via real-time protocol engagement narrowing chaotic sea into vector; cost unmistakable in "fleeting echo that no mortal ear could catch" forcing onward prism-course under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Irreverent awe emerges organically from yearning-chaos translation, reweighting premise in final rainbow's "push the absurd" without moralizing; charged final image answers central question of unheard resonance with lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in kaleidoscopic "poet reading a love letter written in glass"; voice modulates rhythmically, joke to gears carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in "gears cheered, acid sea simmered"; minor paraphrase of "irreverent awe" motif accumulates without obscuring closure image, though dense figuration risks slight overwrite in peak bell-ring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm in acid-sea forge transforms steampunk tropes; prism finale risks bold onward reconfiguration growing from particulars, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
