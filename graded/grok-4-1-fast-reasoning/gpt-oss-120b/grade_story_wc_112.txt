<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to prove time moves sideways clearly drives lever pull and recording, but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating the success; no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure beyond simple satisfaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure at "alien flora’s dormant buds unfurled... acknowledging a new moment... sideways," with conceptual cost to linear time legible in "bending like a strand of frost under a warm hand"; orientation anchored early in station and Lira's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent vines and aviary stillness constrain timing of lever pull and charge closure image of petals shimmering and birds rising; sensory details like "humming turbines" and "amber arcs" selectively mirror experiment under mechanic's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of coaxing temporal signal tightens at lever pull causing nexus intensification and flora response; agency in pull forecloses failure option with felt cost of "quiet knowledge... not by applause."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Paradoxical icy warmth and sideways time emerge organically from flora awakening and station pulse, reweighting linear premise in final "purpose glowed" without moralizing; resonance in birds' ascent offers non-literal answer to coaxing universe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "mechanically warm pulse sync with heartbeat"); rhythmic syntax modulates effectively, but whisper to birds feels voice-consistent yet isolated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("icy warmth" 5x, "magnetic nexus at twilight" 3x, "hush of beating wings at rest" 2x, "subdued awakenings" 2x) create paraphrase churn obscuring propulsion in climax cascade; overwriting mixes metaphors like "violin bow on frozen strings" without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sideways time proof via xeno flora, holographic lever, and floating station transforms tropes; risk in poetic vignette heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
