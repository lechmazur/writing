<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in sculpting identity drives observations and tests, with embodied preemptive nostalgia (grief/joy in heart singing) showing contradiction; minor slip as struggle feels competent without inevitable mistakes compounding under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from crystal song to shadow mapping to final realization as bridge between past/future; CR closure lands on-page in "realized... bridge... smiled, aware... collage of shared memory" with felt cost of centuries' weight turning nostalgia to resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, solid fog, and shadows constrain choices (shadow lengths measured at obelisk where crystal resonates) and charge final image; sensory details (fog pressing windows, lanterns flickering) selectively mirror internal hush via archivist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping collective memory tightens via shadow-crystal pattern discovery narrowing interpretive options; agency in conjecture and examination forces deepening with felt cost of stretched memory in "shadows... softening as if memory itself were being stretched thin."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory in echoes/geometry emerges organically from particulars like crystal song and shadows; final image of engraving insight reweights conjecture as bridge with resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush/echo/whisper diction; rhythmic texture modulates from humming pens to fading silence, consistent under reflective pressure without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulative beats, but patterned repetition of "deepening hush" (4x) and minor paraphrase loops (nostalgic grief restated) dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory mapped in shadow geometry and crystal song transforms trope of archival nostalgia; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes of identity-sculpting without gimmickry.</comment>
