<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like inhaling metallic scent to anchor intention, reveal contradictory impulses of regret and purpose; earned change in self-knowledge via coin repair shows motivation rooted in childhood flaw. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("fragmented self-knowledge") borders therapy-speak but stays concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to gold flowing on whisper, culminating in Charged Poise closure: repaired coin reconfigures balance with felt cost of prior fragmentation legible in "luminous regret... softened into gratitude." Orientation anchored early in foundry post-search; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "hot iron and old soot" and glowing furnaces mirror internal states and constrain ritual on anvil; recurring coin as micro-setting charges final image, evolving with gold seam "like a sunrise caught in a river of steel."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption signaled early tightens via naming-induced gold flow, narrowing options through limit-pushing with visible cost in widened crack and transformed regret; agency in deliberate measurements drives accumulative escalation to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via measured intent emerges organically from particulars like kintsugi gold and name-whisper; final image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting names' heft without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in alchemical precision (e.g., "measured the temperature of the fire that had not yet been lit"); lyrical rhythm modulates purposefully with pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated imagery; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (metallic/mystical veins), though dense metaphors peak at repair slightly risk overload—no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi alchemy and names' metaphysical weight transforms tropes into inevitable ritual; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
