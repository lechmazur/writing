<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Abstract interiority like "surge of directed spontaneity" lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; alchemist's traits feel poetic but untested by flaws or stakes. Friends blur into collective without distinct pressure. No pivotal contradictory impulses in climax brush-dips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vial/shell setup to dome encapsulation as CR closure with vow-cost reconfiguring alchemy's value. Orientation anchored early ("ember nexus at twilight"). One tightening via ripple-to-dome suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and palette constrain ritual choices, charge final persisting glow image. Sensory hierarchy (iron/pine, humming pulse) filters through alchemical POV bias. Coals' flare response evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture presence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to dome with felt cost in fading nexus vs. permanent light. Minimal opposition; agency in breath-mixing lacks narrowing trade-off at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of light-from-ash emerges organically via shell's curl-to-dome arc, final whisper as non-literal CR answer reweighting profit-alchemy. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in "unpredictable joy" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with alchemical perceptual signature (heat as memory); rhythmic diction modulates ritual build. Whispered explanation carries subtext without on-page dialogue excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("returning differently," "revalue") creates paraphrase loops across ritual beats, dulling propulsion. Mixed metaphors coherent but dense in peak (ripple/spark/hum); rhythm varies but template cadence in brush-dips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical synthesis transforms tropes via pocket-sun/nautilus physics into romantic quest. Final star-ripple image risks poetic boldness, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
