<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent—hushing the prophecy via whisper—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; success feels earned yet interiority stays poetic abstraction without raw flaws or micro-choices under stress. Reflection on father anchors briefly but doesn't tilt present tactics deeply. No safety-hedging, but heroic archetype limits individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from emergence to dissolution, with tightening as notes "unspool" code into mist ("each syllable unspooling into nothingness"). Orientation anchored early (saxophonist from cavern into atrium ~50 words). Closure as Charged Poise: prophecy hushed, cost in "weight of every unspoken promise" and legend-fade legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (mist "curling," prism "scattering" colors into "choir of silent colors") mirrors internal hush, with fog/prism constraining play by refracting notes. Recurring dewdrops/micro-setting charge final image. POV bias filters via saxophonist's musical lens; no white-room—spatial flow coherent from cavern to valley edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via note-density unraveling code, narrowing to "final note faded." Agency in whisper forecloses storm path; cost felt in "vested hush" settling like veil and "promise to return." No reversal overload—one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence dissolving chaos emerges organically via particulars (notes as "eraser," code "dissolve like sugar in rain"); final image reweights roar-to-whisper without moralizing. Subtext in fog-as-language ties to father's lesson, charging nostalgia with cost. No tidy binary—ambiguity lingers in "phantom chord."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (breath as "filament," notes threading space); rhythmic modulation builds hush. Poetic diction consistent, voice-motivated for lyric mode—no head-hopping or withholding. Experimental repetition taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting: figurative density ("mist curled," "trembling ghosts," prophecy loops) in every high-pressure beat obscures propulsion (−0.7); paraphrase loops ("quietly vivid," "as dewdrops form," "vested hush" repeated ~5x each without new pressure) dull closure (−1.2 total). Template cadence in mist/fog churn; rhythm stagnates despite variety attempts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: saxophonist weaponizing whisper against coded prophecy in mist-prism transforms musician trope organically. Risky lyric hush-heightens stakes without gimmick; final dewdrop "disappearing" inevitable in hindsight. No derivative templates—voice commits boldly to fog-as-prophecy foil.</comment>
