<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to unmask pretender clear and consistent, traits like planetary presence embodied sparsely in "trembling fingers"; lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, rendering titan archetypal without micro-revelations under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from rune clue to ink revelations; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "pretender’s spectral form, trembling as the rune’s truth stripped away," with temple collapse as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early and constrains path via "towering scrolls," "forgotten alcoves," and "vaulted chamber"; collapse image "ceiling bowed in a graceful collapse" charges final reconfiguration indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in summoning unifies pressure, tightening through pellet-guided "cryptic messages" to rune flare and sundering; cost legible in temple's "inevitable collapse" foreclosing pretender's claim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of deceit crumbling emerges organically via ink-truth and spectral fading; final "hymn of graceful collapse, a lament... also a promise of renewal" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with mystical perceptual signature in glyph crowns and mist runes; voice texture modulates elegantly, syntax reflecting titan's quiet grandeur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, propelling from hushed aisles to sundering climax; figurative density like "cracks spidered outward" enhances texture without muddle, high info density integrates action and image seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ingenious diminutive titan navigating colossal library transforms quest trope; ink pellet's truth-stain mechanics offer fresh magical logic, synthesizing elements into inevitable poetic payoff.</comment>
