<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Servant's motivation to seek joy beneath anguish is consistent and intensifies through discoveries, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in micro-choices under pressure; affectionate detachment leans abstract over embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discoveries tightening to resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at balcony's promise; cost legible in sorrow's melt and ongoing seeking; structure coheres via elevator ascents framing action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered light and goggles recur as micro-setting constraining diary unlock and path illumination, charging final facial glow; sensory details (frost, hum) selectively mirror internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Internal stake signaled early tightens via diary revelation to chamber retrieval, escalating density under Accumulative lens; agency in descent/return forecloses isolation with contentment's felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilient joy emerges implicitly through thawing motifs, resonating in balcony's whispered promise without moralizing; final image non-literally reweights anguish into detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of distant affection; diction/rhythm modulate from ascent's glow to closure's calm sea, purposeful without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated motifs, but repetitive phrasing ("scattered light," "affectionate detachment") creates minor paraphrase loops dulling peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Goggles unlocking emotional-map diary transforms discovery trope into fresh Accumulative quest; risk-taking in lyric fantasy synthesis heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
