<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode emotion's math is consistent and intensifies through borrowed personalities into final realization. Interiority particular via rhythmic mapping (sorrow to minor thirds), but emotions lean poetic over embodied contradictions. Final endurance to disorient self earned, yet lacks raw struggle or blind spots compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to halo cracking, releasing light as CR with conceptual cost of endless chase. Orientation anchored early (Mara, topaz workshop, night). Single scene coherent; tightening via fragment's echo and shard collection reconfigures empathy premise without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: topaz walls pulse violet, halo shimmers like cracked mirror constraining press action. Workshop breathes, expands/contracts mirroring internal rhythm, charging closure shards. POV bias filters via printer's eye (ink rhythms, topaz dust refractions); no white-room, evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotion's math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: press shivers room, halo echoes verses, brightens to crack under density. Agency in transposing feelings narrows options to self-disruption cost. Visible price in pulse alignment and forever chase legible, though abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as transposed function emerges organically from ink borrowings and halo echoes, resonant in final theorem image without statement. Complexity lingers in ambiguity dissolving borders; shards as micro-verses recharge prior mappings non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: notices cadences, equations in ink/heartbeats. Voice rhythmic, modulating intensity (room shivers to galaxy hum); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at shard cascade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density (e.g., "storm of thoughts," "lungs" walls) in peak press beat borders overwriting without full restraint (−0.4). No loops, clear syntax; final shards image recharges cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress empathy-math via halo transforms surreal tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; halo crack/shards heighten stakes uniquely without gimmick.</comment>
