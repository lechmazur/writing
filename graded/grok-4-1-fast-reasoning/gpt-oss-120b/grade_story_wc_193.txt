<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's wariness from pyramid scheme creates genuine hesitation before volunteering the bolt, earning the final surge of "righteous mischief"; embodied in physical securing of bolt amid pulsing fungi. Minor slip in tidy manager callback tying debts to sparkle feels diagnostic rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from glitchy texts to chamber hum and diamond crystallization; closure as CR via warning ("diamonds would only endure while the concept of pressure remained tangible"), with legible conceptual cost reweighting premise. One tightening via bolt placement suffices; orientation anchored early at farm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms constrain and charge climax, pulsing "in rhythm" with pressure and turning air into "translucent violet curtain"; recurring glow evolves causally, mirroring internal shift in pivotal crystallization moment. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alchemy without greed trap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to volunteer's action narrowing options; agency in securing bolt forecloses doubt with warning-cost at closure. Escalation coheres via pattern break in light seam splitting darkness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of honesty spawning brilliance emerges organically from particulars like bolt's transformation; resonant CR in final covenant image reweights past as "threads that could weave new futures." Slip in near-moralizing line ("pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance") borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic noticing ("mushrooms exhaled phosphorescent spores"); stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure, as in climax's "low hum resonated." Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual via Lira's whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting in climax ("seam of light thin as a thought split the darkness, and tiny diamonds began to crystallize") stacks metaphors across pressure beat, dulling propulsion slightly. Minimal loops; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-physical world, pyramid wariness, and fungal alchemy feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in CR closure ("quantum promise blossomed into a tangible covenant") heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
