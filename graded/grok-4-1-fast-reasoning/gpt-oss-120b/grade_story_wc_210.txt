<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in rejecting bottle's whispers for earned revival, compelling mental choices like recalling names/songs. Interiority concrete in imagining stones as story sparks but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions told via "quiet pride" rather than embodied under stress. No safety-hedging flaws, but alchemist's competence shows minimal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of recollections builds to pattern break when bottle opens ("cork dissolved into mist"), yielding RR/Charged Poise in town pulsing alive. Orientation anchored early ("jagged rocks of paper-lantern cove"). Cost legible in "true revival must be earned by remembering," foreclosing easy magic with patient effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring lanterns and amber bottle as micro-settings constrain choices (bottle probed with "pulse of recollection") and charge final image ("paper lanterns floated above reconstructed roofs"). Sensory details purposeful (flickering rice paper against bruised sky) and POV-filtered via alchemical memory bias. Spatial choreography coherent in cove-town interplay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earned revival) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening: sigh into blueprint, mental stalls refilled, fountain of light. Agency in memory work narrows options from false comfort. One tightening sufficient; cost visible in recall demands altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory as catalyst over false promises emerges organically from particulars like bottle's unfulfilled hum and lantern reflections. Final image ("lifted the last lantern, letting its paper flame dance") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting past as "tool, not a chain." No moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing cycle lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (thoughts as "flickering sparks," streets "bend around new dreams"); syntax/rhythm modulate with intensity. Single POV stable, no head-hopping or withholding. Purposeful compression taught early via memory elisions, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "ghost town" (7+ repeats) and "memory"/"recalled" synonyms dull density mid-beats; figurative density high throughout ("streets lit up like constellations") without full pattern payoff. Propulsion strong in opening line but rhythmic monotony in repeated "He [imagined/rejected]" stems. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical revival via cognitive "working memory" transforms ghost town trope through grounded mental tactics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens ingenuity without gimmickry; final "cycle of revival" feels inevitable from established particulars. No template echoes.</comment>
