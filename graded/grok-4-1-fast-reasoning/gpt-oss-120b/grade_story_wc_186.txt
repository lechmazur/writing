<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to prove coincidences' meaning roots consistently in traits and compels communal vow, but interiority leans summative over contradictory impulses acting in scene; ritual lacks micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from personal ritual to caravan's resonance, delivering Charged Poise closure via vow that reconfigures hope with endurance cost; orientation anchors immediately in tower/pavilion, one tightening via amplified shard memory suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass pavilion and star paths constrain alignment ritual and charge final vow image; sensory hum/vibration selective and purposeful, mirroring internal hope without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent in alcove/pedestal/balcony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove meaning via rekindling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through star-tracing to caravan deepening that crystallizes communal purpose; cost felt in fragile endurance, but lacks visible trade-off narrowing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterned meaning emerges organically from prism/star motifs shifting to network revelation, offering resonant non-literal answer in caravan vow; ambiguity lingers in renewal's fragility without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent first-person perceptual signature biases toward cosmic patterns and hush echoes; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct in thistle/hum diction fitting post-collapse lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("thistle-blown hope" x3, "humming" loops, "shard of hush" churn) creates paraphrase artifacts dulling peak density; overwriting metaphors in rekindling beat obscure propulsion despite vivid specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive hush/prism with star maps transforms post-apoc tropes into thistle-fragile hope; caravan turn grows inevitably from ritual particulars, risking lyric reflection payoff.</comment>
