<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode language growth is consistent and intensifies through observation, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions like "weathered innocence" feel told rather than embodied in micro-choices. Final resolve emerges credibly from prior decoding efforts with felt cost in accepting history's weight. No relationships on page, so single-POV baseline met solidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crystal observation to realization of language's "living pulse," landing Charged Poise/CR closure via the offering and crystal's lullaby, with conceptual cost legible in "bridge between past's whispered growth and future's untold stories." Orientation anchored early (Mara in shadowed library at dawn). Single scene fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal as recurring object constrains observation and charges final image, evolving from resisting to humming testimony. Sensory details (light shards, sonic tones, musty air) selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent; dawn light progression causal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode pattern) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via realization it's "library’s memory," narrowing to resolve with trade-off cost in "reticence melting into weathered innocence." Agency mostly observational endurance; one tightening sufficient but low visceral pressure limits high band. Moral calculus subtle in humanity's pulse vs. digital tongues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of language as living growth emerges organically from crystal glints and marginal notes, resonating in final image of folded page blessing without moralizing. Subtext in fractured sequences reweights printed dictionaries' obsolescence. Complexity lingers in possibility vs. decay; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in linguistic decay observations; voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating rhythm toward quieter cadence at close. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early via glints and echoes pays off legibly. Prose reflects reticent mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences," "weathered innocence," "quiet resolve") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across descriptions, dulling density in realization beat. Figurative density high but coherent; rhythm varies read-aloud, but overwriting obscures propulsion in middle. No grammar issues; scaffold trimmed but artifacts cap score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystal encoding lexical tree-rings transforms library trope into living language map; risk in sonic/light synesthesia heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration of sequences feels inevitable from particulars, avoiding generic vignette.</comment>
