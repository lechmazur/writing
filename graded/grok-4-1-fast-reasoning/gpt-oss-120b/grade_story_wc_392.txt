<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to valve turn, but diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" and "watchfully calm" feel unearned mid-action without embodied contradiction; competent solo arc lacks genuine struggle or blind spots compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to pipe discovery and valve DC closure with felt resonance in "water settled"; one tightening via humidity-lantern pattern; orientation anchored early, cost legible in loosened "controlling influence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel micro-setting constrains via seepage/proximity guiding rope trace to valve; sensory hierarchy (hum, patter, glow) reflects POV urgency; lantern-as-object charges discovery beat and final pack tuck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seepage mapping) signaled early, tightens via symbol-map to valve agency with trade-off cost in vulnerability; Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload, but abstract "city's neglect" mutes visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-resistance emerges organically via symbols/lantern to ending reconfiguration, reweighting past grip without moralizing; resonance in "tunnel...thank me" image, but overt "break free" edges thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (rhythmic "reverberate" bias) consistent and biased to investigator's priorities; voice modulates poetically under observation pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("seemed to," "echo/reverberate/thrum" loops across 8+ instances) create template cadence dulling propulsion; overwriting density with mixed metaphors (droplets as "tiny stars...hope") obscures valve climax clarity; paraphrase redundancy in shadow/memory descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of investigator role with railroad lantern linking past neglect to present agency; symbol-etchings turn transforms tropes organically; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
