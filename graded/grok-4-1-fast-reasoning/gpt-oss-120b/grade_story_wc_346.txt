<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "bruised awe that both soothed and scorched her nerves" reveals contradictory impulses; micro-choices like placing the puppet head align with mission-rooted traits. Final mending of "her own cracks" earns change via prior causality. Minor abstract epiphany at close slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from trek/gears to hush materializing/coiling, culminating in Charged Poise closure as "pane of hush thickened, becoming a veil... time bowed... borrowed pause." Cost legible in "moment that could never be reclaimed." Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: "air vibrated through nested patterns of wind and echo," "quiet river of silver light spilled," lighthouse "scarred thumb" constrains placement on "great brass dial." Puppet head as recurring micro-setting charges final glow. Perception POV-filtered via urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pause ticking via lullaby) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: murmur to hum to flare/veil, narrowing to "thin seam where time’s final ripple held its breath." Agency in turning dial/whispering; cost felt in scorching/soothing and lifetimes' weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty emerges organically from puppet/lighthouse mirrors, hush soothing/scorching; final "beauty lay in being beautifully flawed" reweights via image of mended cracks without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in hush-blanket settling "world’s frantic pulse."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: repeated "bruised awe" biases noticing wounds/flaws. Rhythmic poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; lyric mode pays off without head-hopping. Voice modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loops in "bruised awe" (x3) and "nested patterns" (x2) create minor churn in high-pressure hush beats; figurative coherence strong overall. No scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday adjuster/pane of hush/puppet lullaby transforms tropes into inevitable pattern; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, closure inevitable via flawed beauty repricing.</comment>
