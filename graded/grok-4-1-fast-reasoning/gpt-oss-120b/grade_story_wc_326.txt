<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to fetch wisdom from failure drives concrete micro-choices like using the shard and ink, with embodied emotion in the "strange solace in the midnight hush." Internal conflict subtle in fearing overwrite versus syncing pulses; earned realization as mirror without unearned epiphany. Minor epiphanic phrasing in final bureaucratic reflection slightly undercuts raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns build density to ghost's whisper revealing the "single digit misplaced," yielding CR closure in steady pulse and shard's warmth as undeniable conceptual cost of miscounted beats. Single scene anchored early in opal observatory; no orientation debt. One tightening via sync reconfigures options without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal domes, snow-muffled isolation, and porcelain shard constrain defragment tactics and charge final rooftop image where vibrations merge with aurora. Sensory hierarchy (ink sigils, shard chime) reflects Mara's urgent perception. Micro-setting evolves causally from icy hall to snow-capped roof without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defragment before mind overwrite) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ink keys latching code and pulse sync forcing realization. Agency in pouring ink and shard use forecloses erasure path with felt cost in ghost's halt. Minor abstractness in "endless loop" lacks one visceral loss mid-beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of failure as teacher emerges organically from ghost's error confession and shard as "tangible reminder," reweighting premise in final alignment without moralizing. Resonance in "broken piece can still hold meaning" avoids platitudes via ink-pattern particulars. Counter-reading lingers in persistent system flaws.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in heartbeat rhythms and ink sigils; diction modulates from "blinking monitor" tension to hushed solace. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in "droplets fall in chaotic streams." No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "porcelain shard... conduit for the ink-based algorithm" advancing action and image; rhythm varies for propulsion. Purposeful "midnight" and "cold" patterning fits textural lens without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("frozen lantern," "shimmering cascade") slightly blurs one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of clerical glitch birthing digital ghost defragmented via ink sigils transforms tropes into fresh conceptual integrity. Shard rewriting destiny feels inevitable from early retrieval; risk-taking in quantum-heartbeat mirror heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
