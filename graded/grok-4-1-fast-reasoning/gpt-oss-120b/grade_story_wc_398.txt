<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentinel’s patient traits drive consistent motivation to bridge mismatches, embodied in skin-heat seepage and planting choice with solitude’s cost; minor over-articulation of epiphanies like “intersubjective understanding” tempers peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from opening bus slip to Charged Poise closure in letter dissolution and pulsing vineyard, reconfiguring solitude with undeniable endurance cost legible in “heart finally matched.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines and pavilion constrain planting and charge final pulsing image; selective senses like grape-ferment dust and amber-as-liquid-memory filter through sentinel’s perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mismatch stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via responsive tendrils and glowing edge, crystallizing endurance agency with patience cost felt in softened scars and aligned heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harmony-from-mismatches theme emerges organically via evolving parallels, final soil-dissolution image resonantly reweighting embers as roots without literal moral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure, but patterned repeats like “drawing parallels” (3x) create minor template cadence drag in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh planting of letter-edge as terroir-dialogue transforms solitude trope, with whisper-to-dissolution arc inevitable from motif-grounded particulars.</comment>
