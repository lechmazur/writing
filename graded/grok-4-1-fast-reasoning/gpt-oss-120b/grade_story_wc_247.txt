<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in soothing forgotten souls, embodied in "joyful sorrow filled Arlen’s chest" during gestures; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously to complicate micro-choices, resulting in smooth execution without genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density builds from shutter clicks to water rippling in sync; two legible shards transition smoothly; CR closure lands in Lira's vow to "map silence again," reweighting premise with bittersweet cost legible in lingering sorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details vivid and purposeful, with harbor's "rippling in sync with each gesture" constraining Arlen's tactics; moonlight glow charges final lens imprint on dock, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early, but no opposition or reversal narrowing options; "water responded" deepens accumulatively without agency-tested cost or trade-off, leaving stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from void emerges organically via silence-to-melody patterns; Lira's final realization that "creation thrives even in forgotten moments" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature attuned to "mute grammar" of silence; stable limited third per shard with clean transition; rhythmic modulation supports emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak gesture beat ("fingers painting invisible symbols that the wind translated into low, trembling chords"), muddling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in ripple/tremble phrasing dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empty camera framing silence and sign language disrupting water rhythm feels inevitable; transforms creation trope through specific harbor logic, risking lyric over plot without gimmickry.</comment>
