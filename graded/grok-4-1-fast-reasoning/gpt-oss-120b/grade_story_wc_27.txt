<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Awkwardly confident trait shown in solitude to action shift, with embodied bloom during engine shudder; interiority concrete via glyph-tracing and whisper. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal whisper moment, leaning archetypal mystic without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with hum density tightening from glyph pulse to engine roar and worker emergence; orientation anchored early in spaceport perch. CR closure via final realization/vow reweights broken dreams with rhythmic cost felt in reclaimed hearts image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hums/vibrations constrain choices via control panel glyph and buried stone; dust spirals mirror internal shift purposefully. Bruised sky and rusted hulls charge final sunrise window without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess) signaled in whisper, escalates accumulatively as hum density forces stance from solitude to communal pulse. Cost legible in awkward confidence bloom and vow amid roaring engines, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of rhythmic meaning emerges organically from hum/glyph particulars, resonating in final barefoot vow without moralizing. Final image reweights rebellion lull into rebirth cycle non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with cosmic perceptual signature (constellation jacket, starlight key); rhythm modulates from serene perch to roaring chorus. Purposeful elision of stone mechanics taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density but figurative overload ("thunderous serenity" x2, hum loops) in peak engine beat dulls propulsion per overwriting check; minor paraphrase in dust spirals/galaxies. Rhythmic variety mostly supports, no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi decay with ancient stone mysticism transforms tropes via hum-mechanics; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Spaceport glyph pattern feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
