<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in tinkersong traits intensifies credibly to final turn; actions reveal values under time pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with interiority more declarative than embodied conflict; no micro-choices show internal hierarchy with cost until end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of rust patterns and vibrations builds to cadence shift at "central gear clicked into place, sending a resonant pulse"; closure as RR with felt cost in midnight's "shadows claimed the chamber." Orientation anchored early in chamber entry; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's humming air and central gear constrain alignments and tethering; rust rivets and gear teeth evolve tactilely through action. Sensory hierarchy (brass tones narrowing to creak and pulse) reflects urgency; final luminous lattice charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore harmony before midnight) signaled early, tightens via creak signaling "midnight had already begun," forcing final surge; agency in alignments forecloses failure path. Escalation as textural density reweights options under lens; cost legible in time pressure altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truthful renewal emerges organically from rust covenant mending without cuts; subtext in "every lie caused walls to creak" tensions actions. Final amber light spilling reconfigures premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of future wilting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in tinkersong noticing (gears "sang," vibrations "errant"); voice modulates rhythm to pressure, compressing at "final turn." No dialogue; diction purposeful, eliding backstory via cues without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("silver threads through rust," "garden of iron vines," "luminous lattice") risks muddle without stricter pattern. Minor paraphrase loops in rust descriptions ("rusted rivets began to gleam... rust now behaved like a garden"); rhythm varies but elevated diction jars slightly in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Covenant of rust transforms decay tropes into pact with stakes; philosopher's stone chip enables non-cutting mend fresh via "mending what isn’t torn." Ingenuity in amber glow threading vines feels inevitable; risks poetic fantasy coherently.</comment>
