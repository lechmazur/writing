<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Earned shift from seeking death to acceptance via embodied sensations (thinner skin, loosening grip on lace tip), but internal conflict remains subtle rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realization at "I finally understood" feels slightly epiphanic without peak stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from day trawling to night gathering to dawn journal; clear orientation by para 2; CR closure lands on-page in lace tip/journal image reweighting euthanasia premise, cost legible in "loose grip on reality" yielding to hopeful hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (brine/pine, ice groan, frothy spray) filtered through protagonist's ending-attuned perception; marina constrains volunteering choices and charges final lace-in-gold image; spatial choreography coherent on shifting dock/ice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing endings) signaled early, tightens via night buoy moment deepening to acceptance; coherent pressure under Accumulative lens with cadence shift foreclosing death-seeking path; cost felt in rippling stone-settling and loose grip without agency undercut.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of gentle acceptance emerges organically from wind/ice/lace particulars shifting "fold in patience" meaning; resonant CR ending reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity in solace lingers via final light-caught lace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound/wind-biased noticing and poetic rhythm modulating from fevered to resolved; stable single POV with no leakage; compression purposeful for lyric texture, taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density (metaphors in ~80% sentences) with minor muddle (sang/dirge/choir/lullaby loop on sound); paraphrase loops (multiple "wind carried," "sound of endings" variants across para 4-8) dull propulsion; rhythm varies but template stems ("I felt," "The wind") trigger −0.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourist reframed through marina volunteering and lace-as-compass; non-obvious fold-in-patience angle transforms seeker trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet closure without gimmickry.</comment>
