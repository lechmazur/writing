<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find courage roots in the leash break and persists through embodied actions like clutching the ticket, but guides feel archetypal without individual flaws or pressure-inducing choices; internal conflict emerges mildly in waiting versus stepping forward, earned by journey's causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pier vigil to cave map reveal; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "reclaimed the courage... etched upon her soul," reweighting the premise of dormant bravery with felt cost of persistent traversal; orientation anchored early in Loria pier scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and cave constrain choices via indirect ferry path and rune latch, charging final sunrise image; sensory details like "sea’s sighs" and "lantern glowed like a lullaby" filter through Mira's fisherwoman priorities, evolving with mist parting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused courage signaled early tightens accumulatively to cave chest opening, narrowing options via persistent vigil; cost legible in "weight of the ferry guides’ trust" forcing her step, with agency in placing the ticket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of courage as dormant seed emerges organically from sea lullaby motifs shifting to "bright star... etched upon her soul," offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in indirect routes mirrors internal arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of waves and stars stable in third-close POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in emergence, purposeful repetition taught early as pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but patterned repetition of "lullaby" and "gently persistent" borders loop in mid-journey beats, slightly dulling propulsion; figurative coherence like "curled like dreaming clouds" supports lyric mode without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry quest as inner self-map transforms trope through star-stamp rune and courage-seed image; risk in poetic indirectness heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
