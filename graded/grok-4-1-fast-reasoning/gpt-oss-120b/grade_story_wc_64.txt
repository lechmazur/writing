<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via ritual, compelling realization; interiority concrete in tactile thread-brushing but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final endurance earned by prior decoding without strong embodied conflict. Serenity limits struggle depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure ("shape of intentions was a circle") reweighting premise; cost legible in "promise of remembrance" and seed image foreclosing forgetfulness. Single scene oriented early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (humming silence, pulsing silo) filter through gardener's priorities, guiding ritual choices; cobalt silo recurs to charge final dawn image, mirroring resolve. Atmosphere subtly tensions blitheness with gloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover intention shapes) signaled early, deepens via Marlowe/map revelation under accumulative lens, narrowing to healing loop; agency in decoding forces stance crystallization with felt remembrance cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of intentions as traceable contours emerges organically from thread-decoding and circle realization; final "seed ... planted in soil of memory" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting misread cowardice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (threads "sang," echoes "swell"); rhythmic texture modulates effectively but elevated diction borders opacity in peak ritual. No head-hopping; elisions purposeful for lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density pervades ritual peak ("velveteen gloom" x3, "uncharted echoes" x3) without crisp payoff, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops (gloom/silence variants) and template stems ("He [action]") trigger artifact penalties in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery ritual decoding dead's intentions via tapestry transforms trope through tactile myth-making; circle realization feels inevitable from thread pattern, risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
