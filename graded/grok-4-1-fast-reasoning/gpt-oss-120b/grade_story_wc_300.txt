<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract/poetic over concrete-particular embodiment; no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, e.g., trembling fingers hint but guarded heart melts without micro-choice friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of confessions and pearl pulses tightens to RR/Charged Poise closure where Mara places pearl and vows spread, with legible emotional cost in her melting heart; orientation anchored immediately, one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves vividly constrain choices (slow descent, kneeling at pool) and charge final image (resonant exhale, golden cascade crowning ceiling); sensory hierarchy (hush, mist, glow) mirrors internal thaw purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve heart-walls via pearl ritual) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through confession absorption narrowing to her personal cost; agency in opening shell/lifting pearl drives tightening, cost felt in guarded heart's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed hope via confession emerges organically from particulars (glyphs dissolving, pearl halo); final image of beacon caves offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting abandonment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (glows as hopes, echoes as pulses); lyrical voice modulates rhythm purposefully, distinct texture in syntax suits accumulative tone without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("resonant hush" thrice, glow/radiance churn) dull propulsion slightly; figurative density coherent but heavy in climax without payoff penalty, rhythm varies naturally overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pearl-ritual with confession mechanics transforms abandonment trope into luminous communion; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
