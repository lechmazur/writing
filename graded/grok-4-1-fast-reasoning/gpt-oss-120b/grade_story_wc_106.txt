<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: quietly savvy trait shown constraining flower-code micro-choices with vibration feedback; weakness: library epiphany lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, more told than embodied in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from jar unlock to lantern ignition; CR closure lands on-page ("whispered a promise... to guard these moments") with legible conceptual cost of renouncing theft; no orientation debt, one tightening via map surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station/tunnels/library constrain path (moonbeam trail dictates moves); recurring light motifs charge final library image without overt symbolism; sensory selection (humming rails, jade sigh) vivid and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock jar for secrets) tightens accumulatively via flower ciphers narrowing to library; agency in reinterpret actions drives escalation; cost felt in promise foreclosing thief path, legible at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving illuminated moments emerges organically from jar-to-lantern progression; final image reconfigures theft-to-guardianship without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature obsessed by light (e.g., "liquid silver ribbons"); rhythmic texture modulates effectively; minor register elevation in peak library beat borders overwriting but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites most sentences including climax ("cascade onto the wick, igniting a flame of pure illumination"), dulling propulsion without patterned payoff; "luminous/glow/light" synonym loops and repetitive poetic stems reduce information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-thief premise with moonbeams jar and flower codes transforms tropes organically; lantern realization turn inevitable from prior light accumulation, bold lyric fantasy without gimmickry.</comment>
