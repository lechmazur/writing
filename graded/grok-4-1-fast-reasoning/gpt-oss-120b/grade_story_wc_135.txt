<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Archivist's reactively visionary trait and singular motivation to compile fragments drive consistent actions, but lacks embodied internal contradiction or flawed micro-choices under pressure, reading more archetypal than particular; endurance of exile into communal chorus feels earned but smooth without visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build density from solitary signal ("blew a soft note") to communal map and final sloop journey; Charged Poise closure in "set out aboard a weather-worn sloop" reconfigures mission with felt sea costs legible in "staggered intervals of storm and calm"; orientation anchors early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor's post-rain tides and piers deliver fragments, constraining collection via waves ("each wave delivering a new piece"); valve as micro-setting charges final image as "compass of memory"; sensory details (lanterns, gull sighs) filter through archivist's priorities without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling meaning signaled early tightens texturally via fragment density to communal chord and trench call, forcing outward agency; cost legible in sloop's "weather-worn" voyage through "storm and calm," narrowing safe harbor options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning from fragments/absences emerges organically via valve's absorption and communal map, resonating in final sloop image that reweights solitary exile into connective journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with oceanic perceptual signature ("silence fell like a missing stanza") and rhythmic prose modulate from quiet collection to tentative trill; no dialogue, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action (valve "hum absorb the stories like a sponge"); minor paraphrase loops ("navigated absences," "staggered intervals") and repetitive phrasing ("after rain") subtract slightly but don't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms archivist-valve premise into fresh textural memory-weaving with sea-library fusion; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry, final sloop turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
