<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied senses like the rag knot's oily warmth and paradoxical serious playfulness; motivation intensifies via chants and sparks to earned vow. Solo POV limits relational crucible but micro-choices reveal values under self-imposed pressure. Final realization ties defiance to ongoing craft with felt humility cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chants to firework burst, culminating in CR where mosaic glows and gravity lifts, reweighting hopelessness with conceptual cost of persistent work. Single continuous scene fits defaults; orientation anchored in opening lines. Closure cost legible in tucking rag and vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (fragrant mist, velvet blank) mirror internal defiance; fortress walls inhale words and smile, constraining steps via sensed pulse. Recurring mosaic alcove charges final image. POV bias filters blooming vines as witnesses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through chant-spark-burst cadence shift narrowing to realization; agency in rag-lifting and vow forecloses despair path. Visible cost in "work still to do" alters ongoing tactics. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art filtering despair emerges organically via fireworks-as-mosaic pixels; final note glowing offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting void with hope's conceptual cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in endless craft lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (ambient pulse, mosaic memory); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed chants to spiraling burst. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in breeze, longer swells in burst); high figurative density borders overwriting in climax cascade but pattern-taught as voice. Minor motif loops (filter, blooming) purposeful yet repetitive ("He sang low chants while walking" echoes). Dense propulsion mostly clear, no major scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks as defiant mosaic in living fortress; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via sensory immersion without gimmickry. Motifs transform tropes (fire in darkness) through irreplaceable rag and chants.</comment>
