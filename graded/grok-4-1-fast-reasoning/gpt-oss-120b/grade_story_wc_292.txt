<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to honor ancestor drives retrieval and rally, rooted in cartographic traits; final resolve earned via prior dread buildup. Interiority concrete in "trembling fingertips" but often metaphorical abstraction like "paradox she wore like a coat" dilutes embodiment in descent beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of riddle-tracing to storm tightens to Charged Poise RR closure where nail's embedding forecloses flight with felt resolve cost in "vortex slammed against the glass." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration ("iron and seaweed," rain on tin) filters through Mara's priorities; turbine chamber constrains descent choice and glints nail in closure image, charging final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor via nail) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via alarms to rally under storm pressure; agency in sealing chamber narrows flee/protect options with legible cost on rooftop threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping bravery emerges organically from nail retrieval and spirit's "gentle return"; final "red line that traced...courage across time" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting dread without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cartographer's perceptual signature (charts, stanzas); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully, no slippage in descent or rally beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative overload in pressure beats ("syllable press against her spine like damp moss," "captured heartbeat") mixes vehicles and dulls propulsion without pattern payoff; repetitive "nervous confidence"/"spongey dread" loops trigger −0.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, inevitable synthesis of librarian decoding coffin nail amid jet stream shift transforms ancestry trope; risk in poetic weather-spirit weave heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
