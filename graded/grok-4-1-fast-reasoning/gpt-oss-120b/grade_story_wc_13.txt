<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies to quest's climax, compelling release of pendant with felt integration cost. Interiority concrete via sketches and embodied pendant warmth, but epiphanies like "become the echo" border unearned without deeper contradictory impulses in pivotal cavern scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cadence imagery builds to CR closure where pendant release reconfigures time with conceptual cost in final silver water image. Orientation anchored early via Mira, canals, dawn; one tightening via glowing pendant suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and pendant constrain choices (skiff glide to bridge, press into water) and charge final image of dissolving star-points. Sensory details (ripples, chimes, violet glow) selective and POV-filtered through illustrator's eye, mirroring internal rhythm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find echoes' birthplace) signaled early, escalates texturally via cadence intensification to cavern vortex, narrowing to release choice under lens. Agency in pendant actions forecloses linear time path with legible synchronization cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sculptable time emerges organically from particulars like spiraling ribbon and cavern tones, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Resonance in pendant's dissolution answering quest, embracing ambiguity of ongoing chase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with illustrator's perceptual signature in light-fracture sketches and rhythmic noticing. Lyrical diction and syntax modulate purposefully with intensity, rhythmic control heightens pressure to charged poise in release beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm suits lyric mode; purposeful "cadence" recurrence taught early. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during bridge formation slightly muddles peak propulsion, but coherence intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fossil-illustrator questing echo-birth in canal-veins transforms time-trope via giant's nap logic. Risky poetic escalation to CR feels inevitable, pendant release heightens stakes uniquely.</comment>
