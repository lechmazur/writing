<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to find sacred in ordinary drives consistent micro-choices like pruning and sharing bread, embodied in reverent handling of loaf. Interiority concrete in noticing weeds as confessions but leans abstract in "tenuous absolution" without sharp contradiction. Final offering to empty chair earns quiet endurance with felt solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery to slicing/sharing, culminating in CR closure where crumbs in tea glow reweight fragility of sanctity with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in palace/garden. One tightening via uncovering box narrows to meditative stake; final image ("loaf, now reduced to crumbs") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (jasmine with oolong, vines curling) filter through POV's noticing bias, mirroring internal reclamation. Recurring vines/stones constrain guerrilla secrecy and charge final image of tea house breathing. Overgrown courtyard evolves causally, grounding lyric scope without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred in ordinary) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discovery to sharing, forcing endurance of fragility. Tightening in slicing bread ("each cut was a whisper") reweights with cost of memory's warmth vs. loss. Mild internal tension (yearning vs. indifference) coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacred mundane emerges organically from particulars like rose through throne and bread crumbs on tea leaves, resisting platitudes. Final image ("moon rose, silvering the courtyard") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting ordinary with inviting ambiguity. Subtext in empty chair acceptance layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: subtle blooms as confessions, biased toward overlooked sanctity. Lyrical rhythm modulates from gentle observation to charged dusk dissolve, consistent under accumulative pressure. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible in pattern-taught elisions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short whispers in slicing beat), high density in integrated images, but minor paraphrase loops ("quiet" x3, "gentle" echoes) and heavy figurative layering ("steam rising... carry the scent") slightly dull peak meditation without obscuring closure. No filter stacks or template cadence. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh "creeping normality noticer" synthesizes ruin-reclamation with bakery relic, transforming discovery trope via guerrilla lens. Bold lyric risk in single-character meditation heightens fragile stakes organically. Final invitation to wanderers feels inevitable from vine protest image.</comment>
