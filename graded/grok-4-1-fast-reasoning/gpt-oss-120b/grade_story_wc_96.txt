<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: Lira's molting personalities drives reconstruction guidance with fresh insights, shown concretely as "shed the skin of her current persona." Rook's scholar calm complements without overshadowing. Minor slip: emotions poetic but occasionally abstract, not fully embodied in peak building moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from tin to seeds sprouting to travelers arriving; CR closure in "garden in stone" reweights anarchy with conceptual cost of ongoing fragility. Orientation anchored early in library/prison. One tightening via friendship sparking manifesto read.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains choices (shelves as altar, cracks for seeds) and charges final mosaic image; recurring starlight/moon veins evolve from fracture to hope. Sensory selective: "silver glaze turning rusted iron into veins of light." Micro-setting (tin/seeds) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via planting/sprouting/spread under lens, narrowing to luminous endurance. Agency in Lira/Rook's building/arranging; cost legible in chaos-to-garden trade-off. Rook's question "What rebellion hides in a cup?" initiates pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: tin seeds blooming resistance answers anarchy with beauty, resonant in final "mosaic of green light" reweighting without moral. Subtext in shedding personalities enriching choir of voices. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture with rhythmic poetic diction ("trembling candle against night") biased to Lira's poet perception; stable close third-person. Rook's sparse dialogue natural/subtextual. Patterned elision (time compression) taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud, motifs purposeful without muddle. Minor loops in "moon cleared the skyline" phrasing purposeful under lens, but slight template cadence in rebuild descriptions dings propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: molting poet + seed-tin rebellion transforms prison tropes into textual blooming; "penny poet" inflects poverty/poetry uniquely. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently to CR closure.</comment>
