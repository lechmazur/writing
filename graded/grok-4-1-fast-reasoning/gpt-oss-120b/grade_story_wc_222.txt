<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices in swaps reveal contradictory daring and caution, earning the soul-expansion realization; prior training anchors motivation without backstory excess. Interiority concrete via "heart beating in rhythm with the sighing wind," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: swap density builds to final queen-crystal king exchange cracking frost, delivering RR closure with legible cost in softening ice and risked resolve. Orientation anchors early in spire ascent; one tightening via progressive melody and ice response suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice spire and "wrong" violet sky constrain swaps and charge final melt; sensory selection (sighing wind, cold ledge) reflects Lysander's wind/stone reading, evolving causally with events. Pocket sundial lid as micro-setting recurs to propel and reweight climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend curse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via each swap's ice softening and melody urging, narrowing to final high-risk exchange; agency in persistent swapping forecloses curse with felt chill cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of amending wrongs via playful secrets emerges organically from swaps to bridge past/future; final sundial display in village offers resonant image reweighting premise without moralizing, tying to "embrace the unknown."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in reading "language of wind and stone"; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful and biased toward wonder without withholding or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but dense figuratives like "clouds pulse like living ribbons" border overwriting in swap beats without payoff pattern; no loops, varied rhythm supports lyric accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-swap ritual on "wrong-sky" spire transforms thief trope via wonder-apprentice lens; risk in sky-tied timeframe heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
