<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to mend quartz and bridge wisdom feels rooted in lineage and orchard cycles, with embodied feistiness in persistence; Mira's presence forces gentle choices revealing hierarchy of care. Minor slip in tidy epiphany ("accidental wisdom dripping") borders label-speak but doesn't unearn closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (ribbon snag to mending glow) builds to CR closure in final chime and sharpened world, reweighting breach as gain with persistence cost legible in "one careful stroke at a time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard-rafters setting constrains mending via filtered light on pine bench and thorn snag, charging final amber rafters image; sensory hierarchy (whispers, gold light) mirrors renewal without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend fractured quartz) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ribbon incident sparking tool use, narrowing to pulse-alignment with felt patience cost; agency in persistence forecloses chaos path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fracture-to-renewal emerges organically from mending parallels (ribbon, quartz, leaves), final image of ribbon and vows reweighting premise without moralizing; resonance in "every fracture holds a seed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in orchard whispers and light pulses; voice rhythmic and biased toward renewal motifs, Mira's dialogue natural/subtextual in revealing patience lesson.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("deciduous vows") building pattern; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("bruised sky," "choir light") but no loops dulling closure chime propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender in rafter-orchard transforms healing trope via guild-breach pivot; fresh synthesis of cathedral grove and lens-mending risks poetic density, inevitable in hindsight at chime resolution.</comment>
