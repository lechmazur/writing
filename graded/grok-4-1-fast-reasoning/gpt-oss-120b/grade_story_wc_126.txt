<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via acoustic perception and micro-choices like placing the bowl and drawing the bow; motivation to seek beauty compels the central act. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with smooth progression feeling archetypal. Final endurance in perpetual seeking earns change with felt cost in hush's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: violinist's refrain stitches tale, resonating in shipwrecks' echoes as hush reconfigures into space for resolve. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via melody rising and vines swaying narrows silence's grip. Cost legible in "hush was not a void but a space waiting to be filled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective and sensory (vibrations through damp earth, copper glow); greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain via resonating timbers and swaying vines that mirror internal shift. Recurring wrecks charge final image as notes reach "hollow ribs," evolving with events. POV bias filters through acoustic urgency, guiding choices like bowl placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind chronic hush signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tale's resonance to melody's rise, forcing transformation; agency in playing forecloses erasure for perpetual hum. One deepening at climax: vines whisper back trapped notes, charging final image with cost of unfinished seeking. Coherent pressure under Textural lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from music unbinding hush, with subtext in bowl collecting "unfinished stories." Final whisper "the unfinished was a canvas of endless light" offers resonant answer, but villagers' understanding borders on overt statement, softening ambiguity. No moralizing in peak; complexity lingers in hush's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in acoustic details like "vibrations through the damp earth"; rhythmic prose modulates from soft sigh to lingering refrain under rising intensity. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged final image; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying from short notes to flowing descriptions; syntax propels via image integration like "first note slipped out, soft as a seed sprouting in ash." Minor overwriting in figurative stacks during playing ("air thicken with palpable curiosity," "tide seeking a hidden shore") dulls peak slightly, but pattern coherent. No loops or scaffolds; zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn lyricism with acoustic unbinding; violinist's perceptual world transforms tropes of ruin into "chronic hush" as creative space. Ingenuity in bowl collecting sounds peaks in resonant closure; risks poetic elevation without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
