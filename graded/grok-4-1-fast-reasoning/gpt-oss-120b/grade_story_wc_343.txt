<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Solid curiosity-driven motivation with concrete micro-choices like tracing diagonals and chalk lines, but minimal internal contradiction or flaw-complicated struggle; embodied emotions like swelling heart feel earned yet surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from patterns/phrases to halo pulsing then intensifying with silver threads; RR closure in "stranded luminance coaxed into service" reconfigures ship with legible conceptual cost of avoided life-force drain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hopscotch board constrains phrase alignments and charges glow tactics; starling murmurations outside portholes mirror internal pulsing, filtering through Lira's cartographic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harness luminance without drain tightens accumulatively via phrase alignments to chalk circuit; agency in plotting route forecloses drain path with felt anticipation in thickening air.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patterned light/language as communal guide emerges organically from board/phrasebook beats; final starling shift offers resonant reconfiguration of isolation into shared glow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern/noticing diction; rhythmic texture modulates from scanning vellum to pulsing halo sync without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in "pulsed in time with the starling murmurations"; minor hum/humming recurrences pattern-taught without loop drag, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hopscotch runes, phrasebook dog-ears, and luminance vines on copper transforms airship tropes; risk in polyglot patterns pays off inevitably at glow harnessing.</comment>
