<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to capture aging's sound through chalk, rooted in precognitive forgetfulness, drives endurance with felt cost of inevitability; interiority poetic and particular but leans abstract over embodied contradiction in micro-choices like driftwood carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early orientation anchors prophet in fog garden; density tightens via markers to chalk-monolith contact producing sound, yielding CR closure ("understood that to capture... ripple outward") with conceptual cost of release in final inscription image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog sculptures and driftwood constrain navigation and charge final slab image; sensory hush, mist breaths, and vapor shifts filter through prophet's longing, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture aging sound) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening density to sound's swell and recording; agency in chalk placement forecloses trapping via release understanding, with legible cost of forgetting in echoing footfalls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of echoes vs. release emerges organically from tide motifs shifting to ripple outward; final slab inscription reweights clinging without moralizing, resonant via tape hiss and ghost horn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward sonic/memory fragments; rhythmic modulation builds pressure, diction controlled and idiomatically prophetic without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful tide/echo patterns, but minor paraphrase loops ("tide of longing," "echo") in middle beats dull propulsion slightly; no artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junkyard mystic in fog garden etching aging's sound transforms trope of seer into sonic ripple epiphany; risk-taking in sustained lyric texture heightens inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
