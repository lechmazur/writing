<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's drive compels sequenced choices from arranging markers to flute play and return; realization of failure's lessons feels earned via prior weight of cycles, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak venture moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via hush motifs to CR closure in "mission, now clear" realization reweighting single-path clinging as conceptual cost; seam-opening via flute provides one sufficient tightening, orientation anchored early in shelter/canyon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Canyon hush and driftwood markers constrain path to fissure, guiding measured steps; thunder echoes evolve to resonant hum charging final image; sensory selection (muffled footfalls, wind notes) reflects POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting failure insights signaled early escalates via cadence shift at seam widening and world entry deepening knowledge; agency in flute vibration forecloses old-path stasis with felt reconfiguration cost in new weave promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet failures as guardianship emerges organically via particulars like inverted flute and seed-sowing; final cliff whisper offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of broken cycles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fixates on hush/silence bias, modulating rhythm with emotional poise; stable close-3rd POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early; capped by Q7 prose debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive hush/quiet/silence paraphrases (over 15 instances) create loops dulling propulsion in opening beats; stacked metaphors ("avalanchingly quiet," "subtle loom") verge on coherence strain without pattern payoff; minor template cadence in action-desc sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of silence as reality-seam tool and failure as harvest transforms relic-quest trope; hush motif risks bold lyric synthesis heightening quiet stakes organically.</comment>
