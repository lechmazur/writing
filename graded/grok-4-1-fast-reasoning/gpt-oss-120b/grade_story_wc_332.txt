<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent for Mara, rooted in merchant's tale, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; interiority poetic yet abstract without embodied stress degradation or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy. No on-page relationships for status dynamics. Final endurance of longing feels told via epiphany rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via image density (light, colors bleeding) holds to closure as CR: final realization reweights longing as bridge with conceptual cost in "quiet joy blossom within the luminous absence." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. One tightening via vitalized photo echoing pearl, but minimal causal linkages limit higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (breezes carrying songs, jasmine scent) filtered through Mara's priorities; lighthouse stairwell and camera constrain dawn ritual. Recurring sea/reef mirrors internal states via "tide spilling into hidden cove." Charges final image without overt symbolism; micro-setting (palette, camera) qualifies under scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, one textural deepening via photo's pulse recognizing pearl fragment narrows to acceptance. But pressure abstract/internal with no agency-driven trade-off or live option foreclosure; Lio's net lacks causal tie to Mara's arc under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared longing emerges organically from particulars (palette light, vitalized images); final image ("scent of jasmine answer the unanswered questions") offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Counter-reading plausible in endless yearning; reweights premise via archipelago tapestry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Mara with clean brief shift to Lio via "Across the water"; distinct perceptual signature in light/color idiom ("soft blues with amber"). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to burst; no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overuse ("colors bleed... tide spilling," "holding its breath") in every sentence creates coherence drag without pattern payoff; minor synonym churn on "longing/yearning/wishes." Propulsion strong via image cascade to closure; no loops touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-dreamcatcher via light-painting palette transforms magical realism tropes; merchant's pearl motif inflects uniquely to photon rebirth. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight via archipelago callback.</comment>
