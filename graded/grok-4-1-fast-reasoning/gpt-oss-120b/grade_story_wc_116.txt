<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to witness renewal drives the journey, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority poetic yet abstract, with "grips reality loosely" more label than shown trade-off under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of silence building to CR closure ("thoughts dissolve like ink in water," cost of erased centuries legible); orientation anchored early in library/catacombs; single-shard journey tightens meaningfully via swan-guided descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Overgrown library, damp parchment scent, swan glow, and obsidian refuge constrain choices (fissure breathing, stone softening) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, mirroring loose reality without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewal via silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through deepening density to refuge entry; agency in burrowing forecloses clinging reality with felt cost ("erasing the weight of centuries").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "silence births renewal" emerges organically from journey particulars, reweighted in journal line without moralizing; final image (library sigh, lingering silence) offers resonant CR tying witness role to fragile peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (whispers, pulses, dissolving thoughts); rhythmic prose modulates from dim drift to humming silence, purposeful compression legible under lyric lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor overwrite in metaphors ("stone floor softened... air thick," clustered in descent) risks coherence without payoff; no loops, rhythm varies naturally to charged final exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami-swan map and obsidian refuge transforms mystic-trove trope into inevitable renewal arc; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
