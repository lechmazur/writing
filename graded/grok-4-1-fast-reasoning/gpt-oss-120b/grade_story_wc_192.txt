<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation paradoxical and consistent, driving the keeper's ritualistic steps toward renewal; embodied in ring's warmth and outstretched hands. Internal conflict emerges via isolation's cost against teaching impulse, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal threshold approach. Feels symbolic archetype over flawed individual, diluting specificity in climax step-through.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to starlit corridor, culminating in CR closure ("sanctuary... pulsed with promise of connection") with legible cost of sealed retreat and left ring. Orientation anchors early (keeper in sanctuary under starlight). Single scene coherent, no shards; pattern of scars/veins pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashen walls, starlight cracks, and fading threshold vividly constrain choices, narrowing to threshold tap and vein-linking in climax. Sensory hierarchy (cold iron ring's vibration, stone inhale) reflects keeper's priorities. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift from suffocation to breath in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching darkness to breathe) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via encroaching steps and bridge-burning to foreclose retreat. Escalation reweights via deepening density, charging final passage with isolation's cost. Agency in deliberate taps and step-through drives under lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from isolation emerges organically via scars as conduits and final pulsing sanctuary, reweighting premise without statement. Returning starlight/breath images shift meaning, charging closure image. Complexity in paradoxical cost (connection via severance) invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased toward luminous voids and resonant metal. Rhythmic modulation builds intensity in threshold taps; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at starlit merge. No head-hopping or withholding; voice coheres as keeper's lyrical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density ("inhale the cold night," "painting... pale constellations") pervades high-pressure beats without consistent pattern payoff, muddying propulsion in threshold approach; −0.7 artifact penalty. Minor paraphrase loops ("burns bridges carefully" twice, scars as conduits/mark). Strong verbs and varied rhythm mitigate, but closure image dulled slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of isolation ritual into breathing darkness via scars/veins transforms trope organically. Risky lyric metaphor (doorknocker summons shadows) heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry. Irreplaceable frame: sanctuary from choke to wind feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
