<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marlow's stubborn resolve and embodied emotions (chest weight lifting) compel lens assembly with felt endurance, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; reflection anchors to present actions without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to closure's Conceptual Repricing ("Marlow vanished... merging with the lantern’s gleam"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in silhouette merge foreclosing mortal path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underwater library's pressure constrains lens light and charges dome projection; sensory details (phosphorescent ink, water sigh) selectively mirror internal resolve through Marlow's biased notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake to signal rest tightens texturally via light struggle to spirit sighs; agency in shard placement narrows options with visible cost in pressure resistance, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rest in impossible spaces emerges organically from light pulses and spirit chorus; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature (watery ghosts, fractured hope) with rhythmic modulation; no dialogue or head-hopping; elision of backstory legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("chased stillness," "permanent address," "impossible spaces") creates paraphrase loops and synonym churn across beats; heavy figuratives dull propulsion without pattern payoff; density high but overwrites closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker in submerged library transforms distress tropes via lens-as-beacon; risk in poetic accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable merge.</comment>
