<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to compress eternity drives choices consistently, rooted in letterpress traits. Interiority concrete via frost-tracing but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal press moment; epiphany feels declarative over embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in lattice portals; conceptual cost legible in "rupture... reconfigured" line shattering perfect illusion. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass orchard and frost constrain method, charge final image as portals. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal via shivering panes in press beat. High-band eligible but Q7 debt caps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early, escalates via textural deepening from shiver to "cascade... universe rewritten," narrowing to reconfiguration under lens. Agency in spiral press forecloses stability with felt price; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of negotiable reality emerges organically via particulars, resonant non-literal answer in "eternity folded into a single breath" reweighting prior motifs without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in ink-frost bias; rhythmic diction modulates from trace to erupt. Lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with stacked metaphors dulls climax "cascade... shards singing"; paraphrase loops on "bottled whisper"/"rustling awakenings" across beats reduce density. Rhythmic variety strong otherwise, but artifacts touch eruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard/whisper fuses surreal logic organically; bold lyric risk pays in reconfiguration without gimmick.</comment>
