<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to find meaning drives chalk spirals and questions effectively, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany on unlearning reads as unearned summary rather than embodied micro-choices under "lilac unease."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to emergent hush as Conceptual Repricing; closure costs legible in "lilac unease turned to calm" reconfiguring fragmented echoes into unified silence with felt purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory mist, slick walls, and sand depression constrain drawing and charge final mandala image; grotto's breathing glow mirrors internal hush evolution purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of meaning from mess deepens accumulatively as hush gathers, narrowing fragmented echoes; cost of shedding assumptions felt in "warm stone at base of spine," but lacks sharper agency-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as silence-language emerges organically from tile-ripples and mandala; final violinist cascade reweights premise non-literally, charging hush as shared inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern/echo noticing; rhythmic lyric compression taught early holds through closure, modulating with hush resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm, but minor synonym churn in "hush/emergent hush" variants across mandala beats slightly dulls peak clarity without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic tile, sand art, and unlearning transforms mystic-grotto trope; tile's "shedding its surface like a sigh" feels inevitable, risking bold lyric hush-payoff.</comment>
