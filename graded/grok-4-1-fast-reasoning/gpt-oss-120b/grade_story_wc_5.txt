<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in trembling hands and echoing heartbeat, rooting patience in physical actions; micro-choices like slow shard placement reveal values under self-imposed pressure. Earned endurance in seasonal return promise forecloses abandonment path with devotion cost. Minor abstract epiphany phrasing ("covenant") slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pattern arrangement to light burst and steady glow; closure as Charged Poise in plate's pulse syncing breath, cost legible in "seal would hold only as long as she continued to tend." Orientation anchored early in orchard/crater. Single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost-kissed roots and glacier-ice fingers constrain slow actions, mirroring patience; orchard's inhale creaks charge final tableau. Sensory selection (luminous dust, ash mound) POV-biased toward alchemy. Subarctic isolation subtly pressures ritual timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal starlight into emotional maps) signaled early, escalates via flare's burst tightening to binding glow under Accumulative lens; agency in deliberate placements forecloses haste option. Felt cost in ongoing tending alters future tactics. One decisive density shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of patience as cartography emerges implicitly from shard spirals to heartbeat maps; final image reconfigures love/loss as luminous covenant without moralizing. Returning light/heart motifs shift from containment to beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in mapping feelings via light/veins; rhythm modulates from slow builds to flare burst. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. Elevated diction fits alchemist's craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("moving stillness" x3, orchard inhale x2, glow pulses/steadies across paragraphs) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion; metaphor density overwrites high-pressure flare beat without payoff. Synonym churn in light descriptors (luminous, quiet fire, starlight). Closure image slightly muddled by redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, emotional cartography, and discarded constellations transforms patience trope; heartbeat-to-map premise non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight via ritual logic. Risky lyric structure heightens meditative stakes.</comment>
