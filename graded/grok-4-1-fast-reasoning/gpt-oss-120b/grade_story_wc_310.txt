<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" roots consistently in traits like quiet enthusiasm for coins, driving micro-choices like distilling static; embodied emotions in heartbeat resonance and lingering doubts show contradiction. Internal conflict between "stellar doubt" and "uneasy certainty" acts simultaneously without tidy resolution. Minor slip: abstract epiphany ("purpose...a frequency") borders unearned, but prior causality in decoding earns alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coin murmurs to final pop and hum, culminating in Charged Poise RR where alignment reconfigures purpose with lingering doubt as conceptual cost ("doubts still lingered like distant stars"). Orientation anchored early in observatory deck. One tightening via final coin turn pays off cleanly without slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ambered deck vividly constrains: low gravity scatters coins, violet mist shrouds reflection, pulsing light feeds doubt and enables distillation. Recurring deck "breathes with him" and cracks in final image, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy (pops, hums over visuals) filters through Silas's cosmic priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment) signaled early, escalates via textural density of bursts to hum narrowing doubt into "quiet certainty." Agency in turning final coin forces trade-off (doubts persist). Cost legible in "alignment was complete" amid contraction, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of purpose-as-frequency emerges organically from coin prophecy and static, reweighted in final hum without statement. Resonant image of cracked glass and "purpose pulse like a star newly born" answers central question non-literally. Complexity in chaos-inviting truth avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cosmic perceptual signature (dying stars as doubt maps). Voice modulates rhythmically: short pops build to humming cadence. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (flicker bursts to steady hum); high density in coin decoding. Minor artifacts: "ambered" loops (4x) and "stellar doubt" paraphrase without payoff dull early momentum; no closure touch. Figurative coherence in "constellations on a dark map."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy and contracting universe synthesize fresh cosmic lyricism; coin map of lost galaxy transforms trope into irreplaceable constraint on alignment. Risky textural drive heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
