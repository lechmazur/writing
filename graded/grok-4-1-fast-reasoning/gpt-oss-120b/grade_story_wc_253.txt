<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent motivation roots in moral ambiguity and void, driving whittling as endurance; embodied through shavings and whispers. Interiority concrete in cedar curls as whispers but slips into diagnostic labels like "cultivate lightness in sorrow." Final purpose realization earned via prior narration but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in baton lift and farmhouse rhythm shift. Cost legible in "thin curve that revealed nothing" and coexisting grief/joy. No orientation debt; pattern of hush paid off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines constrain atmosphere with indifferent hum/shadows mirroring void, charging final pact; cedar/flowers tactile via scent/shavings. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: earth scent evokes fragrant grief. Micro-setting (baton/bouquet) evolves to reweight ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via narration density to cadence shift at baton completion. Internal pressure coheres but abstract; no live option foreclosed beyond endurance. Cost felt in hollow expansion, visible in unapplauded theater.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief/lightness coexistence emerges via whittling images, reweighted in final bouquet/baton pact without moralizing. Narration line "carving a path for lightness" borders explicit thesis, reducing subtext. Resonant non-literal answer in "remade hush" pulse, but ambiguity lingers generically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in charged emptiness; rhythmic prose modulates from low whisper to declarative lift. Elevated diction consistent but borders register drift in "morally ambiguous purpose." No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops in repeated "remade hush"/grief-carving motifs across adjacents dull propulsion; e.g., "silence that had been stitched... empty theater" restates void. Mixed metaphors like "turbines sang their low hymn" cohere loosely. Rhythm varies but overwriting obscures peak baton beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of happiness mandate dystopia with whittling redemption under turbines transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from cedar/flowers. No derivative echoes; particular void-carving inflects durably.</comment>
