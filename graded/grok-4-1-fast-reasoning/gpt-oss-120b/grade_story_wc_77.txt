<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to confront fear post-resuscitation drives micro-choices like swallowing the clasp and whispering "vanish," but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; advisor applies pressure effectively as secondary but feels more atmospheric than individually flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from luminance/mirrors to viscous air and ink dissolution; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page when fear's gaunt figure recoils into ink-smear, with legible cost in advisor's final bargain offering eternal luminance as beacon/curse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and carousel horse constrain choices, warping self-portraits into dread-whispers leading to center placement; recurring luminance charges final shards-explosion image, with sensory copper-rot and viscous syrup vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trick fear escalates accumulatively via clasp-glow twisting luminance into aurora, advisor's confession narrowing options to let fear drink reflection; Mara's "vanish" whisper crystallizes stance with visible cost in pulsing rose-heart and inhaled funhouse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fear consuming its cursed reflection emerges organically from paradoxical notes and ink-spray dissolution; final bargain reweights premise with resonant ambiguity of carrying luminance as beacon/echo, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV on Mara with perceptual bias toward phosphorescent dread; voice rhythmic and textured in susurrus/whisper motifs, dialogue sparse but subtextual in advisor's guttural laugh and hiss; no head-hopping, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density high but coherent in climax ("shards exploded into burst of lingering luminance"), though repetitive "inhale/exhaling" and "repulsive allure" loops dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies well, no major scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of funhouse mirrors and photographic curse transforms fear-confrontation trope via dream-dictionary paradoxics and luminance-as-disease; advisor's bargain risks bold open-ended poise without gimmickry.</comment>
