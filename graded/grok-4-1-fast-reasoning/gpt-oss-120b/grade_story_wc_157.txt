<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysander's defiance motivation is consistent but told abstractly without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices like whispering to seed reveal traits but lack pressure-tested cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern buildup to CR closure ("living archive of rebellion" reconfigures taxable thoughts with conceptual cost); meaningful deepening via seedlings shifting lacks tighter causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse vividly sensory (buzz, metallic echo, moss) filters through Lysander's priorities and constrains planting; evolves to charge final kaleidoscopic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant defiance stake signaled early but remains abstract/off-page; Dr. Mirabel's entry tightens via potential exposure but quick alignment lacks on-page trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable thought freedom emerges from garden patterns and convergence without moralizing; final sunrise image resonantly reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("warping the ambient air"); rhythmic diction modulates buildup effectively despite late slight shift to Dr. Mirabel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors and loops ("warp" x4, "patterns," "chaos converge") overload density in peak beats like "converging chaos into a single, luminous thread"; paraphrase redundancy dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh plant-language rebellion against thought-tax transforms tropes organically; gourd seed as defiance archive feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
