<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's analytical intuition drives concrete actions like reading mural patterns and fire equations, earning redemption arc with embodied volcanic tenderness at scroll discovery; past arson flaws compound via warped self-portrait judgment without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as art-trail pattern builds density to phoenix/tapestry DC revealing scroll, with Charged Poise closure in final reborn mural glowing amber; orientation anchored early in canyon archive; cost legible in flames' shift from destruction to illumination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert canyon archive with murals, glyphs, and basalt dome constrain discoveries via hidden niches/vaults, mirroring internal fire patterns; dust-as-ash and sandstone integrate tactilely into goal-directed tracing; recurring objects like scorched circle charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rescue promise escalates accumulatively via blaze-revealed portrait narrowing to art trail, tapestry fit, and scroll realization forcing redemptive painting; agency in controlled fires and presses forecloses destructive path with felt sin-judgment cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive fire protecting stories emerges organically from phoenix image shifting to murals sealing archive; final reborn self-portrait reweights premise without moralizing, embracing sin-complexity via glyph-portrait echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in pattern-equation reading; poetic voice modulates rhythmically, fire diction consistent under pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping, purposeful compression legible in art-trail elisions paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid fire-metaphors advancing image/atmosphere, varying syntax for propulsion; minor repetition of "volcanic tenderness" and metaphor density in peak scroll beat slightly dulls but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-librarian redeeming via intuitive art-trail in lost archive transforms phoenix trope through specific glyph-self-portrait judgment and mural-lava spread; bold poetic risks heighten thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
