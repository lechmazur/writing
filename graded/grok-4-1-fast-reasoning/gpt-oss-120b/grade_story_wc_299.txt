<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied micro-choices like cataloging relics to insulate shame, rooted in roadie past; contradictory impulses (facts vs. yearning) act in scene, earning final renunciation of spotlight applause. Minor diagnostic slips like "confidently uncertain" verge on label-speak without full embodiment. Final entry in ledger reveals hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of relic examinations and echoes builds to Charged Poise CR in record player moment, reweighting loss with conceptual cost of quiet conviction. Orientation anchored early (van at quarry trailer). Single scene coherent, no shards; closure cost legible in "rewriting my own encore."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry dust as amber "slow sunrise" and cloth constrain choices (insulating desk, cushioning player), charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (roadie hears truck as "cymbal"). Evolving environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear in trailer-to-outside shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via relics/truck to foreclose craving applause; agency in "wresting meaning" narrows options with felt emotional cost. Truck clatter as micro-reversal tests endurance. Visible price in "insulating fear" alters tactics to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of purpose from wreckage emerges organically via applause echo and cloth motifs, resonant in final record player reprise reweighting premise without moral. Minor overtness in "true stage is not lit by spotlights" borders Thematic Echo, flattening subtext slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature (patina as freight weight, clatter as snare); rhythmic modulation builds under reflective pressure. Elevated diction consistent with appraiser voice, no leakage. Prose as character: syntax layers uncertainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm; purposeful "echo"/"dust" patterns avoid loops. Minor paraphrase in repeated "felt" (calm resolve, at last) and "wrest" overuse dulls one beat (−0.3). No artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser lens transforms tropes (post-failure rebirth) via quarry echoes and cloth; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Final "rewriting my own encore" inflects hindsight inevitability.</comment>
