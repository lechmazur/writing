<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's interiority particularized through embodied perceptions like "boots echoing on rusted steel" and micro-choices in mapping, but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws compounding struggle to earn deeper change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as data points densify into curve toward convergence, delivering Charged Poise closure in "containers shivered as a sudden draft surged... releasing the pent-up pressure in a gentle sigh" with reconfiguration cost of settled responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers as canyon-like channels constrain survey paths and wind flow; anemometer and patch recur tactilely, with patch's compass aligning vector to charge final map image before pocketing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dissipating lingering energy escalates accumulatively via data tightening to tower vector; her whisper and mapping agency force release reconfiguration, with cost legible in "weight of responsibility settle like a balanced scale."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated foresight emerges organically from wind-mapping particulars, resonating in patch-pocketed final image that reweights silence as "measured, understood, and guided" revival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice sustains "hazy precision" perceptual signature biased toward airflow ghosts and murmurs; rhythm modulates with building observations, stable single POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Varied syntax propels density, but minor paraphrase loops on "wind" patterns (e.g., "gusts that curled like ghosts... whispering tunnels") and stacked figures slightly dull mid-beats without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial wind forensics in post-storm container maze transforms labyrinth trope; patch-vector alignment offers non-obvious inflection growing from scientific-poetic particulars.</comment>
