<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to nurture wonder drives micro-choices like placing the locket on her heart; embodied cautious exuberance shows contradiction. Interiority concrete via pulse and bubbling chest. Minor therapy-speak in "professional responsibility" slightly genericizes peak awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to eclipse playing, tightening via adaptive melody syncing breaths. Closure as CR in final promise and cycle, reweighting ordinary magic with conceptual cost of generational carry-through. Orientation anchored early in Sage Ridge oaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oaks/roots constrain timing and cradle sky, mirroring internal states and charging final image of saplings shifting. Eclipse veil pulses like heart, selective sensory weave through harp resonance. Environment shapes climax choice to play precisely then.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture wonder) signaled early, tightens via eclipse play narrowing to shared pulse. Agency in adaptive chords forecloses disconnection, cost felt in trembling smiles and reborn light. Lens escalation via density reweighting group curiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges via curl's warmth amplifying connection, final image of curl echo in new births reweights everyday gestures without moralizing. Subtext in roots' hum invites ambiguity of magic's reach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in bending notes and dreaming roots; rhythmic modulation matches eclipse hush to post-light brightness. Stable close-third POV, no leakage; diction biases to musical wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density in eclipse beat, vivid propulsion via pulsing shadow. Minor paraphrase loops ("cautious exuberance" x3, "softly adaptive" echoes) and repetitive phrasing like "hush" dull some momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse harp ritual charging heirloom curl transforms ordinary magic trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via generational cycle without gimmick.</comment>
