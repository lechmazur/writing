<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via mission brief and grief tremor at click, but interiority leans poetic abstraction over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; embodied emotion solid in "tremor of grief" yet lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from summit setup through light progression to Charged Poise closure at shutter click and grain's captured breath; cost legible in "tremor of grief" and inevitable colony reclamation; orientation anchored in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (basalt powder sinking tripod, vapor plume as ghost), with summit and rising light constraining timer choice and charging final grain image; POV-filtered through inspector's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph vanishing grain) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chemical countdown and light rim; agency in rigging shutter forecloses loss path with grief cost at click, though single tightening fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of archiving fleeting time emerges organically from grain's lighthouse imagery to final photo as "captured breath"; resonant non-literal answer in Earth gaze and whisper reweights endings' promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical texture (rhythm modulates from precise setup to hushed dawn); perceptual signature biased toward curious archival wonder; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in chemical setup lines, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful "dawning hush" repetition pattern-taught but minor paraphrase loops in melancholy phrasing ("melancholy of dawn wrapped... reminding") dock slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar sci-fi with hourglass grain as time-memory relic and chemical timer elegy; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via light constraint.</comment>
