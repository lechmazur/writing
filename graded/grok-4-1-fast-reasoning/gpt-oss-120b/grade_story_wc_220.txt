<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via canine senses (nose, paws, ears) roots motivation in past handler's wish, culminating in earned renewal as "keeper of connections" when leaf pulses memories. Final stance shift shows credible endurance with felt burden of carrying voices. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density from cylinder grooves to leaf's choir of voices, delivering Charged Poise closure where Rook seals leaf and whispers promise, reconfiguring isolation into connection with conceptual cost of perpetual guardianship legible in "carry these voices across the cracked plains."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard's rusted towers, metallic dust, and buried chest constrain discoveries and charge final image, with sensory details (wind whisper, ash-dusted muzzle) filtered through Rook's keen nose mirroring internal revelations. Environment evolves causally, glinting veins echoing copper veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect lost souls) signaled early via cylinder lore, escalates accumulatively through riddle-tightening layers to leaf's memory convergence, forcing renunciation (sealing leaf) with palpable closeness cost. Agency in prism shifts and trot to square coheres pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming kinship emerges organically from tinted layers and leaf's hum, with final image of sealed leaf reweighting wasteland as "tapestry stitched from whispered myths" offering resonant answer to isolation without moralizing. Particulars like copper veins avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with perceptual signature in scent/memory bias and lyrical rhythm modulating from hush to choir; syntax reflects canine intuition without filter excess. Prose texture distinct, eliding human norms for mythic feel taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor metaphor density ("violet and emerald hues," "fireflies in a storm") risks overwriting in revelation beats without pattern payoff, and "wild hush" reprises border paraphrase loop. Closure image clear despite slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of canine guardian decoding post-war artifacts into memory-bridge transforms tropes; cylinder-prism-leaf chain feels inevitable, with dog's nose enabling non-obvious turns. Bold anthropomorphic lyricism heightens mythic stakes organically.</comment>
