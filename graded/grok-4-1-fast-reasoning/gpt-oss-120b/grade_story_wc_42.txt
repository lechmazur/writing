<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to harness spin via leaf rhythm drives micro-choices like attuning tools, but interiority abstracts emotions ("luminous ache") without embodied contradiction acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from quakes and spin to Charged Poise closure ("hand slowed...surrendered its excess spin to the telescope’s lens"); cost legible in ephemeral restructuring, anchors clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quaking foundations and leaf sound constrain attunement choices ("vibration carried the secret rhythm"); observatory dome charges final steady pulse image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to align spin amid shakes escalates accumulatively via chime tightening ("metronome that marks the exact moment"); agency in restructuring forecloses chaos with surrender cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Recurring ache motif reconfigures to "steady pulse" in ending image, resonating endurance theme without statement; emerges organically from repair particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (noticing sighs, ribbons of sound) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation fits pressure, but minor repetition echoes voice slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" loops (4+ repeats) and stacked figures ("grief and wonder...radiant sigh") create paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion in repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Leaf sound guiding cosmic repair transforms sage trope via ephemeral harnessing; fresh synthesis of clock/telescope physics feels inevitable at "tightened the final screw."</comment>
