<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mournfully eager trait embodied in "eyes shining with a sorrow that begged for release," compelling pulls that reveal values hierarchy; internal conflict subtle in treating grief as melody. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak pulls weakens depth. Earned satisfaction at "eyes wet with gratitude" shows credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hourglass slip to repeated pulls restoring laughter; orientation anchored early in tunnel. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration in house responding ("kitchen bowl clanged... light flickered"), cost felt in conductor's ritual return. Single scene coherent, one tightening at photograph shiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel and hourglass constrain sound propagation and timing, charging final exhale; photo alcove mirrors internal states via shiver. Sensory integration vivid ("whirring breath... resonant sigh") through POV urgency. Spatial choreography clear from tunnel to house vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore laughter signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pull repetitions narrowing silence to chorus; agency in guiding gusts forecloses void. Cost legible in "weeping" sighs and wet eyes. House response tests commitment with earned transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-mirth coexistence emerges organically from blower breaths peeling dust to giggles; final image reconfigures "true haunting" as backdrop. No moralizing, resonance in "symphony of restored joy" without binaries. Protagonist arc ties to tending grief as melody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing ("vortex of sound... trembling chorus"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity. Poetic diction consistent, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture distinct without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density ("blade of sound... surgeon's blade," "macerate... grinding into ash") in peak pulls obscures propulsion, mixed metaphors violate logic slightly. Paraphrase loops in repeated "off-key wind" and pull descriptions (−0.6). Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leaf blower as baton in tunnel transforms restoration trope via sound maceration, inevitable in hindsight from "tending unspoken." Risky lyric synthesis heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Fresh premise commits fully to surreal logic.</comment>
