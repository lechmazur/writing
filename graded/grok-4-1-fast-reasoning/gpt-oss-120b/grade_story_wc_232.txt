<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in sensory ties to promise but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; motivation from dying explorer's promise compels but feels abstractly told until cavern entry; change in solitude-to-bridge arc earned minimally through realization, no deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via creek rhythm and ant trails tightening to CR closure at "true map...in the act of choosing itself," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of transformed solitude; orientation anchored early in shop/cavern; single tightening at chip placement suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blooming cavern and creek constrain path via fissure and drips mirroring choices; recurring amber glow and parchment scent filter through Elian's map-dealer bias, charging final shop pulse; sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fulfilling promise signaled early, escalates texturally via creek cadence and ant convergence narrowing to doorway choice; agency in following chip/ant trails forces renunciation of isolation with felt transformation cost in shop's blossom scent; one deepening at pedestal click suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of promises as compasses emerges organically from chip/ant guidance to choice realization, resonant in final maps pulsing; subtext in ant trails as small paths to doors avoids binaries; minor slip in village explanation articulating thesis ("lingering promise...compass") borders echo but doesn't replace image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in map/ink/whisper motifs; rhythmic syntax modulates from dawn catalog to cavern hum; no head-hopping, purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stacked metaphors ("rope...compass needle") in high-pressure cavern beat verge on muddle (−0.5), with minor paraphrase loops on "glimmer/glow" and "creek rises"; density high but rhythm varies less under stress; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of matrix chip, ants, and decision doorway transforms map-trope into intuitive choice metaphor; risk in empirical intuition via water/insects heightens ingenuity without gimmick; irreplaceable particulars like ant trails make arc inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
