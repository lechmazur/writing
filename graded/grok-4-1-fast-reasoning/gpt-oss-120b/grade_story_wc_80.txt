<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive paradox shown effectively in "heart hammered like a drum, yet her face remained a mask," embodying contradiction under pressure. Motivation to catalogue abandoned dreams drives micro-choices like placing notes, with endurance earning the final vow. Limited simultaneous impulses beyond paradox; no deeper flaws complicating peak actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wading to note-placing to vow, culminating in Charged Poise RR where river reflection reconfigures her resolve with conceptual cost of ongoing oblivion-fight. Orientation anchored early via drawbridge and pavilion. Single scene coherent; closure cost legible in "promise to the water" and inkwell weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "slick moss cling to her boots" and "scent of algae" integrate with actions, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Pavilion constrains choices via "rusted beam protruded" access. Recurring marble columns charge final shadow image; POV bias favors absences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archeologist of dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through note-placing tightening against river's claim. Felt cost in stoic paradox forces endurance; "final note into the crack" narrows to vow. No reversal needed under lens, but pressure coheres without live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-preservation emerges organically from notes binding "silence of lost places," reweighted in ending river-mirror image without moralizing. Subtext in "interlaced absence" shifts from structure to her story. Resonant non-literal answer in inkwell glint; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: absences and pulses noticed obsessively. Rhythmic prose modulates to hushed intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to relics and flows.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats with stacked metaphors ("hushed blaze of damp copper," "quiet fire") and loops ("interlaced absence" x3, "hush"/"blaze" churn) dull propulsion, violating density check. Repetitive stems in descriptions create template cadence. Closure image muddled slightly but legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" transforms trope via inkwell/notes ritual. "Winged horse" statue and pavilion ghosts feel particular; risk in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Ending vow inevitable from particulars.</comment>
