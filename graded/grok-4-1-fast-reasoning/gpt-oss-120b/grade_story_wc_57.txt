<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied patience shown in kneeling to decode slick rope and settling into vigil, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; endurance feels archetypal without genuine flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to final knot clicking and spiral mark recognition as CR closure; cost legible in "weight of centuries settle upon his shoulders, gentle as snowfall"; orientation anchored early at dock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rope and fulgurite constrain decoding choice and charge final storage image; sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased (tidal whispers, frost-slick fibers); weather subtly pressures patience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation tightens texturally via unfolding patterns to master weaver's spiral, forcing eternal vigil trade-off; agency in coaxing narrows options with felt patience cost, but pressure remains atmospheric over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of eternal listening emerges organically from knot-decoding and seed-sowing promise, reweighted by spiral mark without moralizing; resonance in particulars like rope as "sleeping serpent" avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal, hushed lyricism modulates with intensity; stable single POV with character-specific noticing (knots as "syllable of forgotten lore"); rhythmic control heightens charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors, but minor paraphrase loops around "patient" and "fog/hush" motifs dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax supports oceanic cadence without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed collector decoding storm-kissed fulgurite against rope lore transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
