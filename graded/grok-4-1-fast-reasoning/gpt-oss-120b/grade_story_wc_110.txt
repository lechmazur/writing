<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's registrar role roots clear motivation to illuminate honesty, driving micro-choices like lens placement; interiority concrete in peace settling, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal projection beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds from doodles to final cascade; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost of perpetual role in "ever ready to turn ambiguity into clarity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forecourt puddles and theater velvet constrain choices via reflections/projections and charge final image on stones; sensory selection (rain-slick glass, dust) mirrors internal thaw purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thawing mistrust signaled early, deepens via lens amplification tightening image pressure; agency in eavesdropping forecloses hidden accusation path with felt peace/cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Honesty-through-transparency emerges organically from doodle-map to figure cascade; final projected figures offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting ambiguity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of phosphorescence/shimmers; lyrical rhythm modulates intensity cleanly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but repetitive "ambiguously clear" phrasing (4x) creates minor loop without escalation payoff, bordering artifact in closing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious doodle-lens-microphone synthesis transforms honesty trope into fresh magical realism; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
