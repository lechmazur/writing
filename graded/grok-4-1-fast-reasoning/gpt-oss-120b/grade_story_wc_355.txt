<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to catalog silences roots in eccentric traits and drives tuning action consistently, with embodied emotion in "hand trembling like a stage actor"; however, lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating the clasp-opening climax, yielding smooth success without earned struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from crystal setup to frequency alignment and ink revelation; closure as Charged Poise at rooftop vow reconfigures silence-to-empathy with conceptual cost of "patient listening," legible on-page without slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workshop's "iron ribs humming" and "crystal plates" constrain tuning choices and evolve with "walls expanding," charging final rooftop image; sensory details filtered through POV's poetic bias (vibrations as "ripples of copper, lavender") mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering clasp contents via silence-catalog deepens texturally at frequency alignment, narrowing to heartbeat resonance with felt cost in "trembling hinges"; coherent pressure but mild opposition limits peak tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as "lattice of quiet recognitions" emerges organically from tuning and whispering silences, with final crowd gasp offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing, lingering via image shift without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("painting the vibrations... as ripples of copper"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, voice coherent and biased toward theatrical lyricism without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering supports accumulative mode, rhythm varies read-aloud; minor paraphrase loops around "silence" (e.g., "varieties of silence... names of the silences") and dense metaphors at peak alignment dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, sonic tuning, and silence-catalog transforms empathy trope via workshop frequencies and diary reveal; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to charged final image.</comment>
