<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No on-page interior conflict or micro-choices under pressure; Mara's traits told declaratively without embodied contradiction, flattening motivation despite clear stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure in "the quiet has spoken," but lacks one meaningful tightening; declarative montage dilutes causality without cost-legible pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist and library reflections amplify theme purposefully; grotto as micro-setting charges final cradle image, constraining quiet rebellion's spread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stake of rebellion signaled early but no on-page opposition or reversal tests it; smooth town-wide success lacks pressure coherent under Accumulative lens, with abstract rather than felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of amplified quiet emerges organically from chess-forest motifs; final "stars blinking like the pieces" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward unspoken; rhythmic texture suits Accumulative mode, modulating from hush to hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "quiet" phrasing and synonym churn ("hush," "silent," "palpable hum") create loops dulling propulsion in back half; metaphors coherent but overwrite density in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of chess, magnets, and windows into town forest transforms rebellion trope freshly; starlit grotto cradle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
