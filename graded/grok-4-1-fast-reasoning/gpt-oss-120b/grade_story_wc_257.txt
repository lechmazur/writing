<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in fingers "stained with copper and grief" brushing wilted rose, compelling micro-choice to trace stencil and earn bloom; change from mourning to keeper legible with felt cost; single-POV voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of cranes/threads builds to Charged Poise closure in final crane placement toward "sunrise she had never seen," reconfiguring grief as "fold waiting to be opened" with conceptual cost; orientation anchored early; one tightening via rose revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's telescopes/crane slots and balcony rose constrain choices (thread-tracing, stencil on stem) and charge final image; sensory details (wind through brass lenses, furnace heat) mirror internal states through POV-filtered action; micro-setting evolves purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bloom from withering signaled early, tightens texturally via rose shiver/glow forcing stance reconfiguration; agency in crane-folding and stencil-tracing forecloses despair path with sting of loss; cost legible in grateful tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lifting intention veils emerges from particulars like vellum stencil to rose revival, final image offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting grief as renewable without moralizing; subtext in genuinely artificial glow enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "charts that plotted the stars... by intention") biases noticing toward symbolic renewal, stable single-POV with rhythmic modulation under subdued pressure; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy sentences at rose shiver); high density advances image/stake, but dense figuratives border overwriting in mid-section without harming closure; minor motif repetition purposeful, no loops obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jewelry maker folding coordinate-cranes from tattoo stencil transforms grief tropes into textual observatory pilgrimage; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
