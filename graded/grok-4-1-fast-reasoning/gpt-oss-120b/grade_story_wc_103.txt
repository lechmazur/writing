<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to reveal time's texture drives consistent traits and intensifies via halo consultation and photo arrangement, earning her final realization; interiority concrete in embodied sensations like "texture under fingertips," but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal design beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in dissolving images and garden responses building to CR closure ("texture of time now palpable beneath soles," resonating with loss/renewal cost); single scene anchors early, pattern taught via early vine-breath motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden setting selectively vivid and purposeful, with living bridge vines constraining wanderer paths and pulsing to refract halo light; recurring mist/photos mirror internal dissolution, charging child's bifurcation image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve perception to feel time) signaled early and deepens texturally via child's pause and photo vapor, forcing stance crystallization under lens; visible cost in photo vanishing alters present to loop past/future seamlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of time as tactile fabric emerges organically from disintegrating photos stitching memory, reweighted in final garden quiver without moralizing; child's seaside sunrise dissolution offers resonant non-literal answer to perceptual boundaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time as "trembling fabric," "sine wave" hedges tied to heartbeat); rhythmic modulation builds from contemplative to charged dusk glow, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image-action (vines "pulsed a soft luminescence"), but figurative piling ("Möbius strip of foliage," "vaporous threads") risks coherence in sustained lyric beats; minor dissolve/disintegrate paraphrase loops purposeful yet drag slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry in breathing maze transforms time-memory trope via halo fragment's non-Euclidean truths; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in child's arch-bloom loop, risking surreal boldness without gimmick.</comment>
