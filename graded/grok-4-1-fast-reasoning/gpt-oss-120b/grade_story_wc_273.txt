<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength in consistently embodied "serene anger" that guides micro-choices like whispering to patterns; interiority concrete and particular to tracker mindset. Minor weakness: final purpose shift leans declarative without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from droplet release to ground dissolving and spiral; on-page CR closure via conceptual repricing of time slowdown as "deliberate deferral," with legible cost in "his own outline begin to disappear." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wind-carved stone humming in sympathy) mirror internal rhythm and constrain perception during crisis; recurring ink/ground as micro-setting charges final etched patterns image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover time slowdown) signaled early with accumulative tightening via patterns pulsing and dissolving ground under lens; agency in ink release drives escalation, but pressure remains observational without strong option-narrowing reversal or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time's deliberate pause emerges organically from ink bridge and crisis echo, reweighted in final spiral without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "ink of history could no longer disappear."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature biases toward pattern/ink rhythms; voice texture modulates poetically with pressure, stable distance enhances charged poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>High figurative density in climax beat ("ghostly tide," "dying star," "vapor of memory") without clear pattern payoff obscures propulsion (-0.5); minor paraphrase loops on "disappearing ink" and patterns reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink-as-conduit, drone projection, and eclipse aftermath transforms time-mystery trope; bold lyric accumulation risks opacity but coheres to inevitable CR.</comment>
