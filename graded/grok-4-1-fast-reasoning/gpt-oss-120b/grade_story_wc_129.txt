<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to graft onto community is consistent and drives key actions like inviting villagers and vowing at the glyph; interiority feels embodied in "each ripple of sorrow...personal ache of light." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with villagers as generic group rather than pressuring individuals. Final endurance of communal duty earned but without sharp micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density builds from orchard hum to glyph pulse and final glow; orientation anchors Arlen, orchard/crater early. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in child's discovery and new sculpture: "tag was not a mark...grew as the community healed," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of fragile duty. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (cracking stems, phosphorescent moss) filtered through Arlen's sympathetic lens narrows to kinship webs; orchard/crater subtly guides search path to pillar. Arbor as recurring micro-setting constrains dedication and charges final image with tapestry/reed sculpture. No white-room; purposeful over visual breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communal binding signaled early via shared search; accumulative deepening in glyph visibility, weaving, and child's fragment tightens pressure under lens, foreclosing isolation with felt ache-to-glow cost. Agency in Arlen's invitation and vow; one meaningful cadence shift suffices. Minor abstractness in stakes until pillar moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from search/weaving particulars, not statement; final image of expanding reed sculpture offers non-literal answer reweighting kinship as living/growing. Subtext in glyph's elusiveness invites ambiguity without confusion; no moralizing. Resonant but echo of "webs of kinship" borders overt in weaving beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in light/ache motifs (e.g., shadows "stitched...into webs"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise at end. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure legibility under accumulative lens. Distinct diction avoids generic templates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in nightfall, flowing in weaving); high density integrates action/imagery without major loops. Purposeful "luminescent ache" repetition accumulates texture, not artifact; minor figurative density in opening orchard description slightly slows propulsion before search beat. Clean mechanics, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic fantasy (reed bridges, glyph as living symbol) transforms community trope via specific orchard/crater logic; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens resonance without gimmick. Final repricing feels inevitable from glyph setup; no derivative echoes.</comment>
