<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code intensifies through tracing water patterns and playing the note, rooted in inspiration and legend. Embodied actions like trembling finger on imprints and swollen violin reveal character under pressure. Final chord as earned endurance of silences forecloses prior searching with felt hush, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from droplets to aligned staff lines and ripples revealing stanza. On-page Charged Poise closure in resonance filling hall, ghost fading, lanterns steadying—cost legible in "hush of unstruck chords." Orientation anchored early in orchestra pit; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flooded opera house constrains via water imprints guiding play and humidity swelling violin. Lanterns flicker to steady, charging final image and mirroring revelation. Sensory details (damp air, pooled water) selective through Mara's musical bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as patterns align to force note, ripples deepen knowledge of silences. Agency in lifting violin and final chord forecloses path with conceptual cost in unstruck hush. Pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of secrets in silences emerges from water gaps mirroring program marginalia, reweighted in "code was not a cipher of letters but a pattern of silences." Final dry program and receding river resonate non-literally without moralizing. Particulars like staff lines drive resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in watery-musical imagery (echo of arias, note as ghost's breath). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from trembling lanterns to steady promise, purposeful for accumulative texture. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (lanterns "trembling like breath on wet wood") taught early, propels to climax without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in "wordless conversation" echoes dull momentum slightly, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water damage as musical code transforms ghost legend trope organically. Lyrical hush amid flood risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via patterns constraining play. No derivative echoes; fresh angle on silences charges closure.</comment>
