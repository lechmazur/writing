<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to salvage purity is consistent and intensifies through dream-mapping to final whisper, but interiority remains abstractly poetic ("cold melt into her skin like a promise") without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream cameos accumulate into lattice forming window of connection, culminating in CR closure as globe pulses brighter post her dream cameo, with felt cost in "veil thicken" and promised exposure; orientation anchored early in descent to shrine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's fissures filtering starlight and liquid mirror globe constrain choices (whispering, palm placement) and charge final image where "borrowed starlight now solidified in her veins"; sensory selection (shimmering air, pine-salt fragrance) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to expose purity escalates accumulatively via dream pattern sharpening to lattice recognition and her embedding final cameo, narrowing to Charged Poise where shards must return; cost legible in "world itself were holding its breath" and foreclosed brute-force path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of woven truth exposing purity in wreckage emerges organically from globe shards in dreams reassembling via connection window, resonant in final "pure thing...illuminate countless other shattered dreams" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("dream-tide wash over her", "ice filaments through a loom"); lyrical rhythm modulates effectively, compression purposeful in pattern-taught elisions like cameo mappings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative density ("threading each revelation like ice filaments") borders overwriting in mid-beats without mid-story pattern teaching; minor paraphrase loops on "melted snow globe" and "starlight" slightly dull propulsion before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-analysis salvage via cameo lattice transforms ghost-whisperer trope, with risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; "child held a tiny silver key" turn grows from prior particulars without retreat.</comment>
