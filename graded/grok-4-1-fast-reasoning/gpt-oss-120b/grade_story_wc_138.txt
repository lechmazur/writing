<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Immortal's boredom and curiosity motivate clear progression from ennui to purpose, with embodied sensations like tingling fingertips grounding interiority. Contradictory impulses (eternal boredom vs. magnetic pull) act in scene but lack sharp simultaneous tension in pivotal reach-out. Closure change feels earned via prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from humming storm to spatial shifts, culminating in CR where goodbye reconfigures eternity with conceptual cost (emptiness dissolved). Orientation anchored early in cavern. No causality breaks; pattern taught and legible to serene vista closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic cavern and magnetic fields vividly constrain choices (walls ripple, guiding step through doorway) and charge final image (dust to flare, walls glow). Sensory hierarchy (ozone, humming) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (amulet fragment) evolves causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boredom vs. post-goodbye discovery) signaled early, tightens via density increase under Accumulative lens: fragment pull forces agency (press amulet), narrowing to tunnel confrontation. Escalation driven by protagonist's micro-choices with legible cost (avoiding fracturing lattice). Charges final step with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as magnetic pivot emerges organically from particulars (corridors of farewells, twin's whisper), reweighting premise in CR without moralizing. Final image (dust sparkling, stepping forward) offers resonant non-literal answer, inviting ambiguity on eternity's folds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (prismatic hues, hushed thunder) modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single POV. Purposeful compression in spatial descriptions taught early, legible at closure. Minimal whispers natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: syntax varies, integrating sensory images into action without loops dulling closure (e.g., amulet dissolution). Minor figurative density in peak (rippling walls) purposeful and pattern-taught, no muddle. Rhythmic control heightens final hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal ennui, magnetic spatiality, and goodbye-as-transition feels inevitable from prismatic-magnetic particulars. Risky lyric accumulation transforms tropes (cursed object, reflection) without gimmickry, heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
