<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation as translator clear and consistent, with embodied wistfulness in handling the music box; however, lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure, rendering the final sharing with the child more declarative than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound captures build density toward Charged Poise closure; child's arrival and lullaby hearing reconfigures the poet's lonesome quest into shared legacy with legible emotional cost in stirred youth; orientation anchored early in loft and dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jars and music box as recurring objects constrain arrangement and charge the final image of shared hymn; sensory details (tinny waltz, rustle of dunes) selectively integrated through poetic perception, evolving loft from feral to resonant chapel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of generational translation signaled early, escalates accumulatively via jar captures deepening to child's eyes widening as link; cost felt in turning lonesome splendor shared, foreclosing isolation with visible relational trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through ancestral sounds emerges organically from jar motif shifting to child's inheritance; final image of uncorked jar offers resonant, non-literal answer reweighting prior captures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (sounds as fireflies, dust motes dancing) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from wistful dawn to charged sunset, prose as character in poetic syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering taught as voice early; minor paraphrase loops in amber/gold imagery and repetitive "sweeten" phrasing slightly dull propulsion, but no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jars as redemption bridge transforms vagrant trope through dune specificity and generational calculus; jars' evolution feels inevitable, risking poetic fancy without gimmickry.</comment>
