<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via orders to coax beast, compelling arrowhead placement; interiority concrete in loosening bitterness and pulsing memory. Weakness: epiphanies verge on unearned mysticism without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in beast revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hums/pulls to shatter/reconfiguration; clear orientation by para 2 (researcher via chute into night-lit garden). Closure as CR: cosmic joke realization reweights premise with arrowhead cost (shatters, empty pocket legible in final lines).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss, frost, vines constrain choices (sway to arrowhead, twine scaffold) and charge final silver-shimmer/smile image. Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased (hums over gloom); evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax beast sorrow) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pulse growth/vines/light burst narrowing to metamorphosis. Agency in receiver lift/arrowhead placement drives tightening; cost unmistakable in shatter and drained phone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of darkness-to-joke emerges organically from beast-as-song shift, untamed harmony particulars; final sunrise/frost-melt image resonantly reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (humming/pulls as playful gravity); stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under rising density, no elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive with varied openings, high density (multi-job lines); minor deduct for metaphor density bordering overwrite in climax burst and frost hope echoes, but coherent/pattern-led without loop obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid-as-song, gravitational flint triggering cosmic laugh transforms tropes; bold surreal risks heighten resonance, inevitable in hindsight via garden's responsive agency.</comment>
