<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in fingertip tingles against murals and texture contrasts (rough metal, smooth glass), earning the final conduit realization; minor abstraction in epiphanies prevents 9+ as impulses lack scene-acting contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density building to label's peel and surge-projected murals as tightening; CR closure lands cleanly in "imprint remained in my mind" with conceptual cost of void-identity conduit, orientation anchored early in port/portrait opener.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers constrain path ("sway with each tide," "shadows forming corridors that shift") and charge final image as "new shelf for layered stories"; sensory selectivity (brine surge, crackling radio) mirrors perceptual layering without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to uncover erased memories tightens via label-numbers match and ghostly murals under textural lens, forcing endurance of marginal existence; agency in following glow yields felt cost in "cold filament" skin tingle, legible at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of restored erasure emerges organically via palimpsest voices and label-filter, resonant in final "texture of memory I could touch and share" reweighting nameless void; avoids moralizing, lingers via layered ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in filtering/layering diction ("blurring some edges while sharpening others") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable first-person POV biases port to memory-texture, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "label... promising death to anyone who misread it" advances plot/atmosphere); purposeful "layer" repetition patterns textural lens without loops, minor metaphor density in high beats contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poison-label as perceptual key synthesizes erasure/port/identity into fresh memory-archive premise; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in CR, transforming tropes via tactile glow/murals without gimmick.</comment>
