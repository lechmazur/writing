<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to harmonize values is clear and consistent, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "slyly heartfelt" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in concrete micro-choices; competence dominates without genuine struggle or embodied flaws complicating the smooth success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from chain examination to valve turn and cascade; on-page Charged Poise closure as elder clasps chain reconfigures unity with felt cost in silenced doubts; orientation anchored early in amphitheater.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like stone sighs, basalt echoes, and ash settling integrate purposefully, mirroring internal harmony; amphitheater constrains via niche adhesive and workshop, charging final image of settling stone ribs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing values signaled early tightens accumulatively via cipher decoding and wheel turn narrowing opposition; cost legible in subsiding tremble and elder's silenced doubts, though told council conflict lacks on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy bridging preservation/progress emerges organically from chain pulses and water conduit; final sapphire-thread image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting division without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic texture ("rusted links singing") and biased noticing of stone breath; brief elder dialogue natural and goal-driven; rhythmic modulation supports lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative language in nearly every sentence of key beats like decoding ("binary pulses... living ledger") muddles clarity; repetitive "tremble" and paraphrase loops (e.g., stone exhale/ripple/subsiding) dull propulsion without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist decoding empathy cipher in breathing volcano transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric fantasy voice heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
