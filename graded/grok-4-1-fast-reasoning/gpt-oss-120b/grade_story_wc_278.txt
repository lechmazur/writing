<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in guilt powerfully compels stitching of amber, earning change at "dissonance inside her chest loosen"; strength in embodied resolve during pivotal repair, though internal contradictions remain more implied than acted simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to resonant reconfiguration in "laboratory breathed once more"; closure cost legible in ghosts' "silent surrender"; orientation anchored early in lab and Lyra's labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab's speakers, desk, recorder constrain choices like tracing letters and stitching; recurring amber charges final image of "thrummed with the gentle cadence"; sensory sound hierarchy perfect for POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt tightens texturally at firmware untangling, forcing endurance with cost felt in chest-loosening; one decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of compassion rewriting haunted code emerges organically from amber's pulse and letters; resonant non-literal answer in final people's grief translation avoids overt moralizing until very end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-perceptual signature stable and biased; rhythm modulates from rustle to hush, teaching poetic compression early for legible closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but overwrought figurative strings in stitching beat ("silver needle, stitching the amber... sang") mix vehicles and reduce clarity; minor sound-synonym loops like "hum/thrum" without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattooist healing firmware via amber-beetle lullabies transforms tropes; bold lyric risk in time-folding lab heightens stakes organically to inevitable close.</comment>
