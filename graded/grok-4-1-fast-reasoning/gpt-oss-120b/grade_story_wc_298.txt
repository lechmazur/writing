<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in soul-patching via orchard rituals, with embodied actions like kneeling and pressing soot revealing reckless idealism under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; resolve feels declarative rather than conflicted. Final change earned but borders on unearned epiphany in "understood then" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions build density from sigil-carving to card-placement, culminating in CR closure where amber thread reconfigures voids with sacrificial cost (card's dissolution). Orientation anchors early in catacomb orchard. One meaningful tightening via root's response spreads luminescence, narrowing to hollow's pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gnarled roots coiling vertebrae and half-lit corridors constrain tactile choices (kneeling, pressing soot) and charge closure image of aligning bones. Sensory details (chill seeping skin, susurrus breath) selectively mirror internal mending. Evolving environment (roots pulling tighter, orchard inhaling) reflects actions without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-patching) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepenings that reweight bartered cost. Protagonist agency in sigil/ash actions forces trade-offs, with legible price in lightened burden and transmuted ash. Climax charges final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial exchange emerges organically from card-pact and root-stitching, resonating in CR where destinies bind renewal without moralizing. Final image (amber lantern, healed hopes) non-literally answers void-filling, reweighting premise via shared cost. Subtle ambiguity in orchard's agency invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with lyrical perceptual signature (twisting roots as veins, sigils glowing faintly) biased toward mending motifs. Rhythmic prose modulates from dusky to warm glow, heightening pressure. No head-hopping; compression taught early via poetic elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots snaking between ossified bones like dark veins" advances setting/action), varied rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops in "inlaying meaning" and "dusky resolve" repetitions dull propulsion slightly (−0.4); no closure harm. Metaphors coherent, no muddle in peak card-placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard and tarot-pact transforms soul-mending trope via tactile root-rituals. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Final CR feels inevitable from established pact-logic without late rules.</comment>
