<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation pulses clearly through embodied pulls like the anchor echoing in her chest, driving adoption of edge geometry; balanced curiosity shows in weighing wonder against caution without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Internal conflict remains mild, more declarative than dramatized in micro-choices. Final teaching earned via prior plotting, but lacks visible cost in a pivotal refusal or endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of alien lattice, sonar pulses, and starlight layers toward CR closure in Mira's whisper and students' gathering, reweighting depth-sky tension with conceptual cost of somber progress. Orientation anchors early in glass corridors and Trenchhaven. Single contemplative shard fits scope; no causality breaks, but minimal tightening beyond test vessel exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic city vividly constrains navigation via sonar arrays and coral arches, with anchor link as recurring micro-setting charging final statue explanation. Sensory details like biolum dimming to mournful blue filter through Mira's priorities. Final image of glyphs in iron reconfigures setting's symbolic pressure without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of starlight navigation signaled early, tightens texturally via edge geometry plotting to test vessel success, forcing equilibrium lesson with subtle thrust-cost balance. Pressure coheres contemplatively but lacks agency-driven reversal narrowing live options. Closure's charged poise crystallizes stance, but stakes feel more aspirational than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balanced curiosity bridging abyss and stars emerges organically from anchor link's evolving symbolism, culminating in non-literal answer via students' question and Mira's soft explanation of forces. Subtext in alien glyphs braiding suns avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars like photon nodes, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with oceanic perceptual signature in phrases like "low tide" motivation and sediment-filtered stars; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed closure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct in syntax weaving description-action. Minimal dialogue natural in final student exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence length mirroring pulses, high density in integrated images like "lattice of intersecting vectors"; purposeful lyric repetition of "somber marvel" taught early without loop dulling propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., braided light, thrumming corridors) risks muddle in peak density. Closure image clear, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alien-deep nav via edge geometry and anchor as equilibrium crucible transforms sci-fi tropes into poetic tension of depth-sky chain. Bold accumulative lyricism risks purple but coheres in hindsight via glyph-iron close. No derivative echoes; premise commits to benthic wonder without hedging.</comment>
