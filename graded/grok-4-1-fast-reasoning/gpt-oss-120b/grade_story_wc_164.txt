<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like seed collection and glass use that reveal her resilient, questing nature under the Accumulative lens. Embodied emotions (heart lightened, rose-colored sigh) layer bittersweet hope without therapy-speak. Minor weakness: lacks sharper internal contradiction acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+ despite earned realization at bridge restoration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seed hues build density to CR closure: final seed stitches rift, reweighting paths as resonant with conceptual cost in fragile memory. Orientation anchored early (Maren entering geode cave). One tightening via mosaic chamber suffices; no causality breaks, cost legible in "recedes before memory fades."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (kaleidoscopic shadows, humming colors) filter through Maren's priorities, mirroring internal states (cheerful gloom lifts). Setting constrains choices: fissure swallows paths until seed resolves it, charging final image. 9+ test met; geode geode subtly guides via pillars and mosaic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening hues narrowing to fissure climax. Agency in placing seeds forecloses vanishing paths with felt cost (memory fragility). One tightening at vaulted chamber suffices; minor abstractness in stakes keeps under 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile recollection emerges organically from particulars (fading images, stitched rift), culminating in resonant CR: paths await resonance, reweighting premise without moral. Final image (stepping with hopeful sorrow) answers central question non-literally. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: emotions as humming hues, perceptual bias toward sea-foam whispers. Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (soft chords to cascade). Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative density (weeping light, painted scenes) borders overwriting in buildup without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly. Minor paraphrase loops ("whispered" recurs). Rhythm varies; no template cadence or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of recollectionist harvesting emotion-hues from bird-seeds transforms fantasy tropes into inevitable geode quest. Risky tone (cheerful gloom) heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
