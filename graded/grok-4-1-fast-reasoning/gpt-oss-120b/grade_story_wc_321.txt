<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to merge timelines clear and intensifies via radio action, but "resiliently positive" trait leans label-only without embodied contradiction in peak whisper moment. Interiority concrete in hourglass weight but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in scene. Final endurance of paradox earned but surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of sound/intention build density to Charged Poise closure where sand rises ("defying gravity and marking the reversal"), reconfiguring timelines with legible paradox cost. Single scene, orientation anchored early, one tightening via radio lattice. No ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spectral grotto mist and starlight selectively constrain via swirling water silhouettes that prompt Lio's deck step. Hourglass as micro-setting charges final floating image. Sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent threads) mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim ferry via timeline merge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through radio waves narrowing to lattice swirl reversal; agency in whisper forecloses vanishing path. Cost felt in "weight of nothing" and paradox settlement charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of intention realigning time emerges organically from hourglass/radio patterns, final "paradox settle like sand" offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting vanishings without moralizing. Subtext in resilient grin amid disappearances avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in time/symbol bias (clocks sideways, grains never fell). Rhythmic texture modulates to incantatory in climax sound lattice. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("vanished" 5x, "spectral grotto under starlight" 3x, "paradox" twice) creates paraphrase loops in final third, dulling closure image; metaphor density (lattice/phosphorescent threads) borders muddle in peak swirl beat without payoff pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-seam ferry vanishings fixed by radio-sound patterns transforms tropes via hourglass defiance; risk in lyric time-bending heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight from early motifs.</comment>
