<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength in embodied final shift ("armor melt into the moss, binding his withdrawn self") earning a reconfiguration, but abstract epiphanies like "loyalty was not a chain but a song" feel unearned and diagnostic without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from panel interaction to moss-binding Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "binding his withdrawn self to the living heart," shaping tactics via persistent patterns constraint; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrated and purposeful, with greenhouse elements (vapor, moss, vines) constraining choices like panel glyphs and charging final image; sensory hierarchy reflects knight's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through vapor-shaping and script release narrowing solitary options to binding cost; agency in tracing patterns forces trade-off, legible in stepping onto trail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance as connective song emerges organically from particulars like program and moss-threads, with final image ("world outside bends toward a new shape") offering resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in mystical diction and rhythmic modulation under rising intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible to closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density advances accumulative texture, but patterned repetitions ("murmured allegiance," "reality shifts") border on paraphrase loops without full payoff, and dense figuratives slightly muddle peak panel beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight's alchemical transformation via marionette program turns tropes ingenious, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes; final pact feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
