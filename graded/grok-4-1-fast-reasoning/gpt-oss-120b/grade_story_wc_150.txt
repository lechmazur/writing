<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to restore faith is consistent and drives actions like placing the sundial base, with embodied sensations like marrow whispers grounding interiority. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany at "faith, once fractured, could be mended" feels slightly unearned without deeper flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from root recoils to final chime and voice, delivering Charged Poise RR closure with felt cost of patient labor in "the last piece clicked." Orientation anchored early in portal entry; single scene fits defaults without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via roots guiding hands and pulsing bioluminescence; charges final image with dawn rays on restored altar. Sensory details like bone rattles and moonlight sliver integrate purposefully through POV-filtered discovery, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoration signaled early tightens accumulatively through deepening resonances (roots lift, bones chime), narrowing to final alignment with visible cost in endured wandering. Agency in collecting shards forces trade-off of time for renewal; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractured faith emerges organically from sundial alignment and ancestor voice, reweighting interrupted past via final dawn image without moralizing. Resonance from bone-laced roots motif charges closure non-literally; avoids tidy binaries with lingering diaspora hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tracing roots "like pale rivers of memory"; voice modulates rhythmically from curious exploration to calm renewal. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing hums and cadences; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "roots seemed to recoil, their tips lifting like reverent hands"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Paraphrase loops in repeated "purposeful wandering" and "interrupted journeys" dull mid-section momentum; figurative density borders overwriting without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard with bioluminescent roots and sundial amid bones transforms restoration trope into resonant ancestral dialogue. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final voice from marrow feels inevitable and non-obvious.</comment>
