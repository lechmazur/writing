<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in lineage with embodied scars on fingertips tracing thread; internal grief contrasts resolve in graft moment. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, relying on summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in coin's resonant tone and warmed sand; orientation anchored early, cost legible in lifted lineage weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand and lagoon constrain graft and charge final amber glow; sensory hierarchy (tactile warmth, salty kelp) mirrors firefighter bias toward fire memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing) signaled early, tightens via graft holding with villagers' shift; agency in coin fastening, but external pressure low, cost mostly internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fire-to-tide images and coin song repricing scars; final dawn image resonates without moralizing, though "scars can sing" echoes border overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature (fire in sand, kelp peace); rhythmic texture modulates calmly, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm integrates setting into action; minor paraphrase loops in scar/song motif and figurative density slightly blur peak graft beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson legacy into symbolic graft with coin song; transforms tropes via specific volcanic sand and cloud migration without hedging.</comment>
