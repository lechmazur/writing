<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied "drowsy alertness" pulsing with senses and skepticism constraining engagement with "radio fragments"; final renunciation earned as pressure "settle[s] into his own ribs." Minor abstraction in epiphanies dilutes contradiction slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of sounds/radio building to Charged Poise closure ("He chose to leave the wheel where it lay"); cost legible in lingering "weight" reconfiguring explorer's stance. Orientation anchored early ("abandoned train tunnel"); no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's "rusted alcove" and "low hum" constrain appraisal choices and charge final "chill seeping into his bones"; sensory hierarchy (sound over visual) reflects POV urgency. Environment mirrors internal weight without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify swallowed truth) deepens accumulatively via pattern from "frantic tones," narrowing to refusal with felt cost in heartbeat sync; agency in listening/appraising tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of haunting industrial secrets emerges organically from appraisal particulars, final image ("weight...lingering") offering resonant non-literal reweighting of skepticism vs. truth's tonnage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in sound-biased noticing ("soundscape for hidden clues"); rhythmic texture modulates but strained metaphors occasionally blur immediacy. Capped per Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("drowsy alertness"/"ghost shift" x4+, confession restated late) and dense figuratives ("frozen syllables"/"emotional tonnage") across beats dull propulsion (-1.2); template echoes in repetitive stems harm closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptical appraisal via radio Morse code transforms ghost trope into quantifiable "density of secrecy"; risk in textural haunting pays off in inevitable refusal without gimmickry.</comment>
