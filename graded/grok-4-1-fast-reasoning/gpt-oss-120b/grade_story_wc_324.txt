<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as protector of voices, compelling the path to alcove; interiority concrete via pulses and scanner but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of heroism feels earned by curiosity without deep flaw confrontation. No strong internal conflict beyond declarative duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses densify from hearing aid to photo to choir, tightening to Charged Poise closure in alcove synchronization with felt cost ("weight of incidental heroism settle"). Orientation anchored early in atrium/twilight. Single scene coherent, no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and twilight constrain path through corridors, charging final image as mist "inhales" post-resolution; statues, balustrade, ivy integrate tactilely via scanner action. Sensory hierarchy fits curious tracer's pulse-focus. Environment subtly mirrors internal echoes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace/save voice signaled early, deepens accumulatively via steadier pulse/voice rise to alcove hymn; agency in following scanner narrows options with heroic cost legible in shoulder weight. One tightening suffices under lens; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of voices bridging death emerges organically from pulses/photo restoration; final pocketed photo reweights curiosity-to-duty arc non-literally. Incidental heroism complicates without tidy moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature in pulse/sigh metaphors; rhythmic texture modulates from hush to thrum under pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; diction purposeful despite elevation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in figurative density ("cartographer of sighs," "marble tears") across peak beats dulls propulsion slightly; minor "faint" loops and repetitive pulse phrasing trigger −0.6 artifacts. High density otherwise with varied rhythm. Closure image clear despite slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-tracing via hearing aid pulses transforms supernatural trope through poetic specificity; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric voice heightens without gimmickry.</comment>
