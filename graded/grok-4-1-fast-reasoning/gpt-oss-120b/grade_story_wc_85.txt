<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Guilt as consistent trait compels sifting choices with embodied remorse via watch hand's warmth, earning redemptive stasis; interiority particular to genealogist's trade avoids stock epiphanies until final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as carving density builds to CR phrase revelation with conceptual cost of confronted lies; orientation anchors early via terrace and journey; no causality breaks touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood shore and terrace constrain sifting action and frame arc, with sensory hush/brine filtering POV priorities; recurring terrace charges final image reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake to quell guilt escalates via accumulating carvings under textural lens, tightening to phrase break that forces renunciation with legible remorse cost at alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges from false memories to driftwood revelation without statement; final watch-hand image non-literally answers via reweighted guilt particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature filters histories through poetic idiom; rhythmic modulation heightens introspective pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites climax ("tide of remorse, each syllable a drop") with muddled vehicles, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on guilt/regret in sifting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Driftwood-encoded truths transform genealogy trope into organic conscience reckoning; poetic synthesis of relics and shore feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
