<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Claustrophobic trait embodied in shallow breath and trembling hands yet overridden by codex pull, driving micro-choices like aligning it with console; final ease earned via endurance with felt cost in void risk. Contradictory impulses act in scene during phase transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to phase transition; closure as Conceptual Repricing via codex map reveal and burial reconfigures monitoring promise with conceptual cost of sealing secrets. Orientation anchored early in vestibule entry; no shards, contiguous drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via tide-timed apex activating arrays and cable nodes aligning with gold flecks, charging final burial image on sand as tide recedes. Sensory hierarchy (brine, hum, pressure) filtered through spelunker's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access unremembered via codex tightens texturally in phase shimmer narrowing to void risk; agency in whispering sequence forces trade-off, cost felt in "pressure that tasted of brine."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring invisible/unremembered emerges via cable language and gold map, resonant non-literal answer in burial reweighting prior veil-crossing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature in sea-sensory bias (crashing hush, jellyfish walls); rhythmic modulation heightens transition pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (jellyfish bellies, serpents) consistent to tone; minor paraphrase in tide echoes purposeful, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of phase arrays, phosphorescent codex, and cable farm transforms undersea trope into fresh monitoring conceit; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
