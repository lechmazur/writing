<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits and motivation root Mara's actions in her belief in stories' geometry, shown through scarf adjustments and whispers. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses or visible internal struggle, with emotions more atmospheric than particular. Final logging feels earned but without heightened stakes compelling a foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonances build density to the atrium projection (Charged Poise closure), with cost in impermanence legible in "not permanent; it required continual care." Orientation anchors early (library midnight, Mara drifting). Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting pulses with purpose—glowing shelves, vaulted ceiling—constraining Mara's geometry-tracing and scarf alignments. Sensory details (ozone/ink scent, page sighs) filter through her priorities, evolving causally to lattice dissolution. Scarf as recurring micro-object charges final tuck, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pulses to ripple and projection, narrowing to delicate balance cost. Agency in her whispers/alignments drives tightening; patrons' unawareness adds subtle opposition. Price felt in non-permanence reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stories in hyperbolic geometry emerges organically from scarf resonances and projections, resisting tidy morals via ambiguity of impermanence. Final ledger image offers non-literal answer, reweighting solitude as stewardship. Particulars like walnut-tree memory avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (geometric/quantum lens on library). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, peaking in projection surge. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density (Möbius/hyperbolic lattice) borders overwriting in climax ripple without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. Minor paraphrase echoes ("pulsed," "vibrated," "resonance") in scarf beats; rhythm varies well overall. Closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes science/poetry ingeniously via geometry/scarf conduit, transforming tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in hindsight, with star-lake projection as fresh inflection heightening stakes. No derivatives; bold vision coherent.</comment>
