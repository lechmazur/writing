<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to weigh dream vs. empire rooted in mulberry ache and intensifies via vines' warnings, compelling climax choice; interiority embodied in chill seeping bones and chest ache. Internal conflict between empire's offer and plants' protest acts simultaneously in coffee reading and violin alignment. Final renunciation earned by prior discoveries, with shared grief as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from violin resonance to coffee stains and vines, culminating in Charged Poise RR as violin weaves dissent and envoy lowers sword. Orientation anchored early in observatory with Elara's task. Closure cost legible in "heart heavy with mulberry ache yet lightened," reconfiguring destiny without micro turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like creeping vines and brass desk constrain choices, with vines whispering warnings and desk enabling violin-stain alignment pivotal to climax. Recurring coffee stains and violin charge final image of frost-laden chord. Sensory hierarchy (tactile chill, visual cracks) reflects researcher's lattice-seeing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream vs. empire) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as coffee reveals conditional council seat and vines warn of wilt; agency in propagating dissent via violin forecloses annexation path. Escalation driven by deepening readings, cost felt in envoy's shared ache and dimming promise urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of dream outweighing empire emerges organically from vine protest, coffee lattices, and violin song resolving perforated destiny without statement. Final image of autonomous skyward garden and brighter glow offers resonant reconfiguration, embracing ambiguity in grief-flavored hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lattice/vein readings and frost metaphors; voice texture modulates poetically from reverence to rebellion climax. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased toward archival whispers and emerald flags.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sentence openings and purposeful fragments like "Time ran thin"; high density integrates action, image, mood. Minor overwriting from stacked metaphors (lattice/veins/perforated) in discovery beats slightly dulls propulsion, but consistent pattern serves accumulative texture without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice violin mapping destinies via plant telepathy and coffee augury transforms provenance trope into rebellion tool; risk in vine-grown city payoff feels inevitable from early whispers. Bold perceptual angle on futures as stains/perforations heightens stakes organically.</comment>
