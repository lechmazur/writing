<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's claustrophobia is embodied concretely ("chest were a rubber band nearing its limit") and resolves earned via collection, with micro-choices like whispering specific silences revealing values; mother's brief role applies gentle pressure without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterned imagery building to CR closure in final lines ("doll...pulse with the gilded hush," reweighting cramped space as vast); orientation anchored early in bunker; single arc with taught inversion constraint tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (clouds "like cool silk," vines "humming") constrain climb and collection, charging final doll's warmth and bunker's hum; recurring trellis and doll as micro-settings mirror internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pure silences) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via limiting exposure to prevent tangling, forcing trade-off; agency in doll placement and retrieval forecloses impure collection with felt fear dissolution as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vastness in confinement emerges organically through silence flavors and heart expansion, resonant in final image ("cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky") without statement; ambiguity lingers in hush's dual sound/taste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (silences as "sour bite," "sweet aftertaste"); rhythmic prose modulates from dim corridors to trellis hum, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but dense figurative layering ("silver thread...sprouting delicate branches") in peak collection beat borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling immediacy; no loops, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal silence-collection and gravity inversion transforms bunker trope via specific "flavors of hush" and doll paradox; risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
