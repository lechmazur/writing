<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to repair covenant via chess patterns intensifies through embodied pulses and stone; micro-choices like bishop placement reveal precision under exile's weight. Mild internal conflict lacks sharp contradiction, leaning meditative over crisis-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density buildup from pulses to placements culminating in CR closure ("covenant... a canvas, waiting for the brushstrokes"); light sliver reconfigures premise with legible emotional cost in "sorrow can be a compass." Single scene orientation anchored early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic currents and twilight constrain choices (shadow aligns with star, pulses urge listening); stone as micro-setting charges final glow. Sensory selection (skin brush, stone hum) purposeful, POV-filtered via chess lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair covenant) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sensed fracture to phrase/light revelation narrowing exile's despair. Agency in placements/whisper; cost felt in melancholy endurance charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in difficult emerges organically from chess sacrifices and silence translation; final canvas image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in hope-sorrow interweave avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via chess motifs (pawn's advance as wisdom); rhythmic poetic texture modulates with intensity, stable close third-person POV. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" loops (4x variants in final third) create paraphrase churn dulling closure image; dense figuratives (queen’s yearning, dust shoulders) in every peak sentence lack pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion. Template cadence in repetitive stone/stone dent phrasing; scaffold redundancies like dual covenant reconfigs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile with magnetic mysticism and covenant canvas feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric chess-sky board transforms tropes. Stone's dent/pulse as beacon adds irreplaceable ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
