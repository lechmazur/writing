<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion via tastes like "bitter as burnt cumin" and micro-choices like tracing pools and pressing fingertips reveal values under pressure; minor slip in lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance of spreading sorrow earns change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from pool analysis to pavilion immersion to coral sigh/cracking; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with conceptual cost in "sweet promise of memory he could now season without burning the soul," reweighting remorse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pavilion's pulsing coral and slick walls constrain choices (palm slip, fingertip press) and charge final image of cracking shards and sandstorm; sensory selectivity (brine droplets, chill carrier) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing collective remorse tightens accumulatively via tasting flood to hand arcs dissolving ice; agency in deliberate motions forecloses bitterness dominance with felt cost of contagious spread to stone/air.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming contagious grief emerges organically through tasting/touching particulars, culminating in resonant final image repricing remorse as seasonable without literal moral; ambiguity lingers in "ready to fracture at a whisper."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic biases (taste as memory/spice); rhythmic modulation peaks in "coral began to crack... with a sigh," heightening pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "bitter as burnt cumin, yet underscored with a bright citrus"; minor overwrite in clustered coral/remorse metaphors during peak (−0.3), but propulsion clear and no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, contagious remorse in coral ice, and tidal metaphor transforms tropes into inevitable healing arc; risk in abstract contagion paid off via tactile closure without gimmickry.</comment>
