<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and consistent motivation in Mara's affectionate detachment, shown in her "measured calculations" amid the process; micro-choices like rubbing the petal reveal values. Minor slip: internal conflict more stated than simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal saturation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory currents builds to Charged Poise closure at "sealed the vial with a click," reconfiguring half-truths into vendible emotion with felt cost in "weight... like dust on her palm." Orientation anchored immediately in grotto; one tightening via chime suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto's static and residue constrain petal-charging choice, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (taste of rain, crackle) reflects Mara's priorities. Vivid, selective integration mirrors internal fusion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest emotion) tightens accumulatively via escalating crackle and vortex, narrowing to chime's cadence shift; agency in subsuming process forecloses raw data path with detachment cost legible at sealing. Minor abstractness in gamble before pivotal swirl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of commodified half-truths emerges organically from petal fusion, resonating in final "bridge between raw insight and the empathy" image without statement; ambiguity lingers in her poised commerce.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in static/scent bias; rhythmic prose modulates from humming buildup to chime's crystallized poise. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but heavy figurative layering ("liquid gold," "moths," "vortex") in process beats borders overwriting, dulling propulsion slightly; minor paraphrase loops on "half truths" and static. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion commerce via static-charged petals transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric process heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at courier's grief crate tying to closure poise.</comment>
