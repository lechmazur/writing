<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in guilt, embodied in vial warmth and hand-washing; strength in micro-choices like tracing glyphs. Weakness: contradictory impulses summarized ("guilt a scar") rather than acting simultaneously; epiphany ("he understood then") feels slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to CR closure ("unused courage was not a place but a state, waiting for those bold enough to claim it"); cost legible in "broken ties...dissolve like frost." Orientation anchored early; one deepening via snow trail.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via snow for codes/trail and bluff descent; mist/silver hush recur to charge final valley image. Sensory hierarchy (cold breath, pine scent) POV-specific; geography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via courage) signaled early; agency in placing pillbox triggers map glow and pass entry, narrowing to realization under accumulative lens. Cost felt in past-haunting to dissolution; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of internal mending emerges organically from snow glyphs/pillbox to spring renewal; final phoenix light reweights premise without statement. Subtext in courage-as-state avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (glyphs, vapors as whispers); syntax/rhythm modulate dawn hush to charged poise. Stable single POV, no leakage; pattern-taught poetic compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in descent); high density integrates action/image. Overwriting flaw: figurative density ("like a silver hush," "luminous river") in every descriptive beat without pressure modulation risks coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy redemption via snow codes/pillbox alchemy; transforms tropes through lyric accumulation to CR. Risky poetic frame heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
