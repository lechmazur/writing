<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve names roots in consistent traits like her wax-casting past contrasting cold, with embodied thaw from doubt to resolve; micro-choices like tracing and reweaving reveal values. Minor slip in "forgiving yourself" phrasing feels externally diagnostic, but doesn't unmotivate closure promise. Internal conflict shows via silent doubt yielding to surge without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rope-tracing echoes to glowing cascade to new tapestry, yielding Charged Poise closure as sanctum reconfigures to living library with conceptual cost of eternal vigilance ("promise to return each solstice"). Orientation anchors instantly (Mara barefoot in sanctum); constraint of rope shapes all tactics. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum, aurora-veined frost, reindeer-sinew rope constrain reweaving choices and charge final luminous map image; sensory hierarchy (cold pulse to melting veins to dancing curtains) reflects Mara's thawing priorities via tactile action. Evolving details (frost melts causally) mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via echo-whispers tightening to tonal choir and traveler's addition, forcing stance crystallization in ongoing duty; agency in reconfiguration forecloses silence with felt cost (resolve matching glow). One decisive deepening suffices, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of living memory thawing inner cold emerges organically from rope-song revival and traveler thread, reweighting premise in final image (tapestry never freezes) without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity in endless solstice returns invites reflection. Resonance from particulars like punched scrap to parchment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (fire-metal memories amid ice); rhythm modulates from steady pulse to thrum. Elevated diction consistent but occasionally drifts from embodied crisis; no head-hopping, elisions taught early (rope mechanics) pay off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak reconfiguration beat ("silver serpent... cascade... ribbons of light" in most sentences) dulling propulsion (-0.7); paraphrase loops ("thawing fire/snowmelt ardor/melt frost/thaw cold") and synonym churn ("illuminate/glow/light") across adjacent lines (-0.4). Momentum drags slightly in repetitive motifs; rhythm varies but template stems recur ("She [action], feeling...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax caster reviving organ-names via rope-braids in aurora-sanctum transforms preservation trope into luminous conduit; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thawing stakes organically. No template echoes; conceptual commitment to transcribed memory feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
