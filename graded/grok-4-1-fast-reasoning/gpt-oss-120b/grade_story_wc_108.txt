<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied phobia shown in "heart pounded louder than the explosions" and adaptive micro-choices like decoding via stunts, earning final confession; minor diagnostic slip in "transform betrayal into a weapon" at pivotal pour moment softens peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via shell→thread→decode→vial→lever chain narrowing to transformation; on-page CR closure in "confession that my greatest stunt was simply surviving" with legible self-betrayal cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted shelves and dome constrain lever choice and trap risk, while constellations rearranging into "name backwards" charge final CR image; sensory details like "groaning like old bones" filter through stunt POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant fear-overcoming stake signaled early tightens via decode reversal forcing vial confession trade-off; agency in pouring amber forecloses hidden-self path with felt cost at lever step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of betrayal-to-power emerges organically via shell whispers and amber ripple; resonant non-literal end reweights premise in "vulnerability is power" realization without moralizing, though phrase borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with stunt-specific perception like "stunt-trained eye"; distinct poetic texture modulates rhythm, but minor elevated diction clashes in peak stress beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in climax ("amber fire ripple," "trembling drum") without pattern payoff obscures propulsion; repetitive "sigh/groan" and "trembling certainty" loops dull peak lever moment; syntax varies but synonym churn evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt decoding on child's cast unspools mythic leviathan fragment; risk in cipher-stunt method transforms phobia trope organically to charged CR without late rules.</comment>
