<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via somatic cues like "wind tugged a pine needle across her cheek" reveals contradictory grief and resolve; final endurance of loss with promise earns change. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers") slightly abstracts peak reflection without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure: "the pearl of stillness glimmered brighter," reconfiguring loss into resolve with felt cost of frozen grief. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arboretum's pines and sea lavender filter through POV urgency, constraining choices (bench pause, sapling kneel) and charging final cliff-edge image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens calm amid roar; recurring wind mirrors internal rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate stillness amid loss) deepens accumulatively via photo press and sapling whisper, narrowing to resolve with legible cost in "freeze the grief." Agency in micro-endurances tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilient hope emerges implicitly from particulars like scarred sapling mirroring survival; final "path forward, lit by quiet resolve" reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in pain's persistence lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in somatic noticing (e.g., "chest fell and rose"); rhythmic prose modulates from introspection to charged poise. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops. Minor repetition of "rhythm"/"marker" borders template cadence but stays voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of trauma via nature's persistence transforms survival trope; "drone strike wedding survivor" angled through somatic resilience feels inevitable. Bold accumulative risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
