<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to conduct symphonies rooted in homesickness drives micro-choices like aligning shell and whispering "Conduct," with embodied emotion via sand/grain memories; interiority particular but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward epiphanic summary at "homesick no longer felt like a burden."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from hush to vibrating chords; Charged Poise closure reconfigures homesickness as compass with conceptual cost legible in "lake shimmering with color, each ripple a note"; orientation anchored early in spire by lake at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake constrain choices (sketching on frost-etched glass, resonance through cracks) and charge final image (lake as vibrating membrane); sensory hierarchy reflects Lian's perceptual bias toward sound/memory, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to summon symphonies tightens via cadence shift when "nautilus segment pulsed, releasing a wave"; agency in command "Conduct" forecloses longing path with felt cost of exhaustion push, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-orchestrated transformation emerges organically from shell-mapping and lake's response; final fortune "Your heart is the baton" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing, recharging horizon motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (phosphorescent chambers as thought-compass); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to surge, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overload in climax ("shards of light that cascaded down the spire, each shard a baton") mixes vehicles and risks coherence; minor paraphrase loops on "mirrored horizon" dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing, shell-compass, and ice-symphony transforms tropes into inevitable conductor arc; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, premise irreducible.</comment>
