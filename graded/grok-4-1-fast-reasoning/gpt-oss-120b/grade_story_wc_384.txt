<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to forgive unfinished drives micro-choices like tracing hidden script; contradiction between treason as weapon/balm acts briefly in "wield it as a balm, not a blade." Earned resolve at closure via prior promise and thorn interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from thorn reveal to resonant tracing and key melting; Charged Poise closure reconfigures past-present link with legible cost in "weight of calibrated treason lift, replaced by...resolve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary and drip constrain tracing (metronome urges flourish, frequency resonates verses), charging final "echoing silence" hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forgiving unfinished tightens via key-script reveal forcing balm choice; agency in placing key and inscribing deepens under lens, cost felt in treason weight lifted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive forgery emerges organically from thorn/script acts; final thorn glow offers resonant answer, but whisper "unlink the shackles...heart commands" borders explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with drip-rhythmic cadence and artistic perceptual bias stable in single POV; modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms climax tracing beat ("glimmered...revealing hidden script"); paraphrase loops on drip/metronome and forgiveness/unfinished dull propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thorn-key unlocking scripted treason transforms forger's arc into hymn of hope; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
