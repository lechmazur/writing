<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "worrying tranquility settle over her" and trembling fingertip tracing lines, compelling transmitter action with foreclosed solitude; subtle confidence enables bold micro-choices like slipping glass from lamp. Dry wit surfaces effectively only at close ("sarcasm softened"), slightly limiting distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from phrasebook reveal to signal burst and ice crack; closure as charged poise/CR lands decisively in final vein of water slipping through, reweighting rivers-from-ice premise with dread-cost of thaw ("calm that bordered on dread... inner tremor"). Orientation anchored immediately; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain choices (antenna alignment, boots crunching ice) and charge final image (glinting vein in crack); sensory selection (iron taste, wingbeats) mirrors internal tilt purposefully. Micro-setting via glass condensation integrates tactilely into decoding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map rivers' origin) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening revelations (condensation script to twelve-language word); agency in pressing phrasebook to pane forces trade-off, with legible cost in cracking ice underfoot narrowing fragile balance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>'Singular convergence' emerges organically from motifs (rivers merge, veins intersect) to resonant CR in "ice sang, and the world listened," reweighting silence-to-thaw without moralizing. Complexity lingers in hope/terror ambiguity tied to Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (maps/geography bias, condensation as "secret script"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, lyrical compression taught early via phrasebook pays off legibly. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied openings, high density in pivotal decoding; but figurative overload in pressure beats ("droplets... like veins, each convergence echoing... glass became a portal") muddles slightly without pattern payoff, docking clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Condensation-as-code on glass from lamp synthesizes atlas editing with myth in non-obvious way, transforming convergence trope via polyglot phrasebook and falcon signal; fresh inflection in transmitter glyph imprint heightens stakes organically.</comment>
