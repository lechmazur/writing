<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to forge aberrant mercy intensifies via stone-tracing micro-choice, earning final past-dissolution; interiority concrete in embodied ash-taste and looping memories, but occasional label-speak like "retrocognitively trapped" slightly abstracts impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mosaic patterns densify to renaming pulse, delivering CR closure in "past dissolve" with conceptual cost of nostalgia foreclosed; orientation anchored early in plaza/sky/fire; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone as micro-setting constrains word-formation choice ("tracing... fractured designs") and charges final "blueprint for rebuilding... hearts"; sensory ash-taste and light pulses selective, POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (summon mercy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via kneel-whisper-cadence to sky-stitch, narrowing nostalgic trap with felt cost in "scorching grief" cooled; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of steel-forged empathy emerges organically from rename image shifting to "world’s new foundation"; resonant final children's laughter weaves without moralizing, but minor drift into summary weeks-later.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mosaic/light noticing; rhythmic poetic diction modulates intensity, prose-as-mind reflects radical's empathy; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies with purposeful lyric swells, high density integrates sense/action; paraphrase loops in "chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" (4x) and "warm coldness" (3x) dull propulsion without full pattern payoff, minor overwriting in stacked sky metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Hearthsteel" naming synthesizes fire-steel into fresh post-apoc mercy beacon, transforming tropes via mosaic blueprint; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
