<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to heal via photos is consistent and compels her arrangement, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses; whisper "We will transmute pain into a masterpiece" reveals values without deeper internal friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as photo arrangement builds to villagers' tears/smiles and case closing as Charged Poise RR; felt cost of ongoing work legible in "tomorrow she would once again linger"; oriented early with field/ruins/Mara.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like lavender perfume settling thoughts and vines pulsing with photos charges actions; setting mirrors emotional terrain, constraining her lingering and drawing villagers purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing signaled early, escalates accumulatively via photo web to villagers tracing arcs; tightening in tears-yet-smiles forecloses unhealed pain with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-masterpiece emerges via arcs and feather, resonating in final image without overt moralizing; whisper line slightly direct but subtext lingers in "hope finds its way through every crack."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns/arcs; child's dialogue natural and advancing; capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heavy metaphor density in photo arrangement ("shards of light, curved edges... tangled web") overwrites high-pressure beat without pattern payoff; repetitive "collective healing" and "lavender" create paraphrase loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle archivist using photo arcs in ruins/lavender transforms healing trope organically; risk in whimsical lyricism heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
