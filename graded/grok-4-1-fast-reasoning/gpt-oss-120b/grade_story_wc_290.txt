<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied in "lungs protested" and "breath tighten" contradicts "prudently adventurous" spirit to drive micro-choice of entering passage, earning final dissolution of fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory buildup (compass gears, walls quiver) yields CR closure in key's realization and garden reveal with felt cost of vowed sharing; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern organ pipes and luminescent fungi constrain choices via claustrophobia and guide spatial progression, charging final garden image; sensory hierarchy narrows under stress to glow and hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant claustrophobia stake tightens via passage entry under textural lens, agency in incantation foreclosing doubt with legible emotional cost in "weight of centuries lift"; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rebellion theme emerges organically from spatial shifts to CR realization—"rebellion... against the forgetting of stories"—reweighting premise without moralizing, resonant in key's symbolic turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias toward shifting geometries ("rewriting reality"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in organ surge without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm, but minor figurative density ("spatial mutiny," "blossoming map") in climax borders overwrite without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny premise ingeniously synthesizes compass-organ mechanics into fresh CR, transforming tropes via organ-memory rules that heighten claustrophobic stakes organically.</comment>
