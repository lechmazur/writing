<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to reforge bond drives all micro-choices like gathering spices and whispering Arion's name, with embodied dread ("tremor of change") contradicting steady resolve in the ritual climax. Internal conflict shows simultaneously in reluctant yet proceeding actions. Minor flaw: idealized whisperer lacks sharper blind spots complicating the peak transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from sensing presence to spice-mixing and manifestation, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where antlers brush palm transfers vitality, thinning space with legible cost in "skin blossomed with faint bark patterns." Single continuous scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph, lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight vividly selective (violet glow jars, curling air), constraining via hidden alcoves for spices and mirroring internal yearning; charges final image as fruits glow and trees receive tribute. Sensory hierarchy fits Liora's priorities, integrated into actions without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond via dreaded metamorphosis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ritual beats tightening to spectral bow and touch, narrowing to flesh-binding with agency in extending hand; cost unmistakable in bodily change foreclosing pure human form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bonds beyond death emerges organically from spice veil, stag reunion, and bark-skin image reweighting mortality; final orchard sigh offers non-literal resonance tying phoenix echo without moralizing. Subtext in reluctant shift enriches cosmic intimacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing (orchard pulse through soles, wind hum as Arion); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, prose texture distinct and voice-motivated for fairy-tale cosmic tone. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passing ear test, but minor overwrite from clustered metaphors ("filament of starlight," "cosmos contract") in peak ritual slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, clear syntax, purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy-tale metamorphosis with phoenix/fortune cookie inflections transforms tropes via spice mechanics and bark-skin cost; bold cosmic intimacy tone risks lyrical height without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight from orchard constraints.</comment>
