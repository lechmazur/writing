<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies from curiosity to purpose via discovery, compelling the lie and vow; interiority concrete in noting metadata and patterns. Weakness in limited contradictory impulses during lie-post beat, lacking embodied stress or flaw-driven hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern buildup from numbers to vault unlock; CR closure in crew's message reconfigures absence with conceptual cost of transformed archive. Lie-post inciting incident causally scatters numbers, tightening to resurrection; orientation anchored early in archives entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via hidden server farm accessed by numbers, charging final pulsing archive image; sensory details (hum, amber glow, static thrum) selective through Lia's priorities. Micro-setting of terminal and vault gallery mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate deleted files) signaled early, tightens texturally via lie scattering numbers to vault access under Accumulative lens. Agency in fabricating post forecloses prior stasis with ripple cost; escalation coheres to Charged Poise in purpose surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital persistence emerges organically from numbers motif and final message repricing absence as presence; resonant non-literal answer in archive's new pulse avoids moralizing. Subtext in phantom breadcrumbs and limbo files invites ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in archive whispers and glowing numbers; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm for discovery beats. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction biased toward data echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in pattern descriptions; minor overwriting in "echo of forgotten songs" recurrence risks loop but pays off thematically. No scaffold or artifacts dull closure; purposeful metaphors integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social metadata as cosmic SOS transforms cold case trope; numbers-as-checksum and digital afterlife bold without gimmick. Risk in poetic vault gallery heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
