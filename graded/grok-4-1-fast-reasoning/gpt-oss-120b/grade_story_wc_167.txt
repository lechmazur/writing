<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to illuminate mundane value is consistent and intensifies via ritual observation, embodied in tracing light and ripples. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "unsettled thoughts" noted but not dramatized in conflicting micro-choices. Final lighter heart feels earned accumulatively but lacks visible cost foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stone toss to ripple patterns reweighting harbor's worth. Closure as CR lands on-page in "world’s hidden ledger balance itself," with conceptual cost of seeing persistence in stillness. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via spiral echo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pond, prism atrium, and mist constrain ritual observation and charge final stone-pocket image. Sensory details (fractured light, noctilucent veil) selective via POV bias, integrated into action. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane) signaled early, but minimal escalation; ripple patterns deepen insight without narrowing options or agency-driven trade-off under textural lens. Pressure coherent but low, no live reversal or felt price beyond mild settling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of value in ripples/prisms emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonant in final "prism of revelation" without moralizing. Subtext in light arguing colors invites ambiguity on hidden worth. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in light/ripple fixation; single POV clean, no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates serene intensity effectively. Elevated diction fits reflective POV without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("read between lines," "clear complexity," "noctilucent reckonings") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling propulsion in insight beats. Mixed metaphors (ripples as sentences/dialogue, light arguing) verge on muddle without payoff. High density but scaffold-like redundancy in ending gratitude list.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh glazier-ritual conceit transforms mundane harbor into revelatory prism, with ripple-spiral as ingenious pattern echoing ship's wheel. Synthesis feels organic, risking lyric over plot for thematic payoff.</comment>
