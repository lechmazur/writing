<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "tremor of purpose rise beneath her calm exterior" reveals contradictory calm/reverence under pressure; micro-choices like synchronizing screw with pendulum earn realization. Minor epiphanic phrasing at close ("world breathe anew") slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from repair to chime, delivering CR closure in "felt the world breathe anew" with cost of scentless endurance legible. Orientation anchored early; single tightening via pendulum alignment suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and water clock constrain choices (screw in cradle aligns with pendulum); recurring fog charges final image as it lifts, revealing sunrise. Sensory selection (mist on fingertips) mirrors POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil miracle) signaled early, escalates texturally to deepening realization; agency in tracing/aligning forecloses doubt with felt cost of lost smell. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of miracles in fragments emerges organically via screw's evolution; final image of passing mother offers non-literal resonance reweighting scentless perception without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("translated vibration into language of emotion"); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density but paraphrase loops ("fog" as filter/tableau/mist repeated without new pressure; "trembling calm"/"ordinary miracles" churn) dull propulsion, especially in final third. Minor metaphor mix (threads as pathways/script) borders coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scentless aromatherapist mapping birth screw in clock shop transforms tropes; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
