<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in traits like riddle-crafting expertise, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the embedding scene; smooth epiphany ("sudden surge of purpose") feels unearned without embodied struggle. Final purpose endurance lacks visible cost beyond abstract nudge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from specs exam to cookie embedding to visitor revelation, culminating in CR via gull/sunrise reweighting fates with conceptual cost of "lives subtly rewired." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via method realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam, lantern lenses, and spiral staircase constrain choices (aligning for ink flow, cache location) and charge final gull perch; sensory details (howling wind, steaming dough, sea rhythm) selectively mirror internal encoding drive without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covert prophecy encoding) signaled early; accumulative escalation via deepening method (specs to ink spiral) narrows to deliberate revolution, but low external pressure and abstract cost ("promising that the next wind would carry") temper legibility in visitor beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from particulars (riddles spilling truths, microdot infusion); final gull cry/sunrise offers resonant CR reweighting accidental to revolutionary without moralizing, though some ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature (mirrors, spirals, flows as biased noticing); rhythmic prose modulates poetically under purpose surge, no head-hopping despite visitor shift; elision of mechanics taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density high but coherent in lyric pattern ("spiral that mirrored the beam"); minor synonym churn on "secrets" across embedding beat dulls propulsion slightly, no loops touching closure; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies, microdots, lighthouse spycraft into prophetic encoding revolution feels inevitable from early specs irony; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
