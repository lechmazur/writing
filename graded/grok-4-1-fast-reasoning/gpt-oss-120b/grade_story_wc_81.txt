<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation clear but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; Mara remains unflawed and competent without complicating flaws driving inevitable mistakes, as in her seamless hypothesis-to-vault progression. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with knowledge density building to CR closure via stamp's glow confirming charter, reweighting myths with conceptual cost of deliberate burial. One tightening at ledger revelation suffices; orientation anchored early. Minor and-then sequencing before vault.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (seeping water altering ink, parchment scent) filtered through Mara's methodical gaze constrain cataloging and charge final vault image. Setting evolves causally with blackout tremors; recurring stamp as micro-setting enables cipher discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) signaled early with hypothesis tightening options via cross-references, but visceral cost remains low—shaft descent lacks opposition narrowing paths under lens. Agency in discoveries drives escalation coherently once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth reclaiming hidden knowledge emerges organically from particulars like drowned poetry and architect lineage, with stamp reprise offering non-literal resonant answer in glowing slab. No moralizing; ambiguity in staged flood lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in precise, tranquil observations (ink hue shifts, gear rhythms); rhythmic prose modulates calmly then charges at vault emergence. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but repetitive phrasing ("antique ink stamp" x4, "reclaimed stillness" echoes) creates minor paraphrase loops in descriptive beats, dulling momentum before vault. Figuratives coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged archive quest via stamp cipher and tidal buoys transforms trope of lost knowledge; risk in poetic tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via hypothesis payoff.</comment>
