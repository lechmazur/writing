<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mother's needle and past promise compels attentive endurance, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final serenity feels earned yet unpressured by genuine flaws or tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("river... smooth as a finished stitch"); ticking silence marks cadence shift with conceptual cost of honoring layers over erasure, legible in final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>River as palimpsest and needle constrain stitching method and charge final smooth surface image; sensory details (ticking, spindrift curl, wet stone scent) selectively mirror internal shift without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill river memory) signaled early, tightens via ticking metronome to fog-lift reversal under textural lens; attentive agency forecloses turbulent chaos with felt pulse-sync cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of distilling complexity emerges organically from stitching promise, resonant in non-literal final image ("not to erase, but to honor each layer"); ambiguity lingers in release vs. remembrance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-person POV with perceptual signature (layered mists, subtle ticks); rhythmic modulation builds meditative intensity without distance slips or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density (palimpsest, spindrift) borders overwriting in mid-beats, with minor paraphrase loops on serenity/ticking (−0.6); propulsion holds via varied syntax to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman stitching river memory via awareness transforms meditative trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in hindsight-inevitable peace without gimmickry.</comment>
