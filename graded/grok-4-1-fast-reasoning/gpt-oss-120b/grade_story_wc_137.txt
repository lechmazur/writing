<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic motivation clear and intensifies via tile shifts compelling transcription; contradictory impulses (logic vs. curiosity) act in scene as eyes soften amid precise noting. Final bridge from skepticism earned by whale-guided patterns with embodied peace cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("rare peace settle in her bones") edges below peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tile discovery to glowing shifts and final stanza, culminating in CR where tile settles into "perfect square of calm" reweighting skepticism with felt cost of softened doubt. Orientation anchored early (cliff tower, night migration). No lens ambiguity; constraint (tile rhythms) shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (brine scent, low calls through panes, tile glow) filters via Lira's priorities; tower/crystal panes constrain via inhaling sea memory and alcove storage, charging final image of pooled glow as lighthouse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcribe entangled memories) signaled early, tightens via pattern shifts coaxing verse under Accumulative lens; agency in disciplined noting narrows to peace with visible cost in softened eyes and foreclosed aloof cosmos. One deepening suffices; cost legible in "turned skepticism into a bridge."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (doubt/wonder entwine like whale ribs) emerges organically from tile conduit and migration arcs; final CR image ("unheard symphony...a feeling to inhabit") resonantly reweights premise without moral, lingering ambiguity of repeating journeys.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (constellations as aloof, whales' arcs as punctuation); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density to charged closure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("ribs of a whale’s heart," "silvered tide of bodies") in transcription beat risks coherence without full pattern payoff, docking mild overwrite. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square as whale-song conduit transforms skepticism trope; tile's prime sequence mirroring migrations feels inevitable, with lyric risk heightening resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
