<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied conflict in the serene ritual; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, leaving change unearned. Interiority poetic yet generic, with stock phrasing like "tranquil blaze of purpose" rather than character-particular struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds hush motifs to Charged Poise closure where wing rises and prophecy softens ("sharp edges softened into nothing"), with felt cost in world's pause. Single scene oriented early ("nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook"); one tightening via glyphs spiraling suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brook and stone constrain ritual alignment ("aligning its tip with the water's edge"), charging final image as "river of stars"; sensory details (pine smell, firefly arcs) selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early; accumulative escalation via wing's vibration and glyphs narrows to cosmic thread tightening, with agency in breaths/chant and legible cost in slowed brook. One deepening reweights under lens without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of merging terrestrial/cosmic via silence emerges organically from ritual particulars; final image ("brook resumed its song... code forever unspoken") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting hush as power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in hush-noticing ("hidden currents of quiet"); rhythmic prose modulates serenely, teaching poetic compression early for legible lyric closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but hush/quiet synonym churn and figurative density ("tranquil blaze... quiet flame") in peak ritual create minor loop artifacts, dulling propulsion without obscuring closure. No template cadence or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual hushing prophecy transforms tropes via lyric hush accumulation; risk-taking in voice-heightened stakes feels inevitable, with wing's rise as non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
