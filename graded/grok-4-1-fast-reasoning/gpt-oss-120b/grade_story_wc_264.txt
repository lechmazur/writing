<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Guard's dreamless endurance earns fleeting warmth at "a reminder that even the most barren souls can be kindled," but internal conflict remains more stated than simultaneously acted, limiting contradictory impulses to epiphanic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of motifs building to closure RR in clock ticking reverse and sparks raining, with conceptual cost of dreamless toil reconfigured in "trees... formed from pure light"; orientation anchored early in pacing terminal and dune.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dune and clock constrain choices, charging final image as dune absorbs sparks and "blossoms turning azure, then violet"; sensory filter (echoes, pulse, hum) reflects guard's perceptual shift without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to cultivate sparks tightens accumulatively through chant aligning clock to archive, forcing agency in whispers with felt cost of prior dreamlessness in softening face; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from barrenness emerges organically via sparks-to-trees arc, resonant in final "silhouettes rose where trees once stood" reweighting ash premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in "fractured lullaby" diction and rhythmic modulation from sighs to chorus; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but patterned "fractured lullaby"/"whispered" recurrences border paraphrase loop in late beats without full payoff, slightly dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum archive and post-apoc renewal via clock/dune transforms tropes, with risk-taking lyric structure heightening stakes in clock's reverse tick inevitability.</comment>
