<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's blindness and methodical trait root motivation in textured sensing and imagined emotions, earning her empathy's awakening; strength in micro-choices like pressing the brush harder amid tremor; minor weakness as contradictory impulses remain more implied than simultaneous in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (mist tightens, tremor, crack); closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with legible conceptual cost in "a single tear rolled down the stone, catching the ribbon fragment"; single scene, early orientation, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed quarry and mist constrain perception and respond dynamically (swirling tighter, fissure splits mist); ribbon fragment as recurring micro-setting charges final image; sensory details (textures, echoes) filter through Mara's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken stone's empathy for cold cases) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening density and agency (harder brush presses yield crack); cost legible in foreclosed emotional dormancy and quarry's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges organically through painting process and quarry response, reweighting absence into remembrance; final image of tear-glinting ribbon offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyric, texture-focused voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature (fingertips tracing, feeling tremors); rhythmic modulation supports hush tone; minor drift into elevated diction jars slightly with embodied crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("furrowed hush" thrice, "methodical"/"lance" loops) and paraphrase redundancy (method descriptions) create template cadence and dull propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors obscures cause/effect in response beats; density suffers in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesizes face-blind artist as quarry-oracle for cold cases, transforming tropes via tactile opposites; risk in stone's anthropic response heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</question>
