<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong helix-minded traits shown in spiraling thoughts and precise calibration amid risk, earning realization to revive dreams; embodied emotions in pulsing palm sync. Minor slip: motivation told early without initial contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from calibration to hum/projection/tremor; CR closure in "understood...communion" and humming shards with legible cost in fracture risk and fading tableau.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and basalt fissures constrain alignment/bridge-forging choices; recurring mirror charges final humming shards image, mirroring internal evolution via shifting stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interface memories tightens via tremor reversal, forcing endurance with fracture cost; agency in pressing palm narrows options under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of dream revival emerges organically from projected tableaux to realization of communion; final "compass for wandering imaginations" reweights record-to-revive non-literally, minor overtness in "communion" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in neural-circuitry lens on rocks; rhythmic modulation peaks in "light danced...heart quaked," purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful helix motifs propels to closure; minor overwrite in climax figurative stack ("shimmering tableau...painting scenes") dulls propulsion slightly without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering synaptic plasticity on stone for dream archaeology; risk-taking in surreal rock-neurons transforms tropes, inevitable in humming shards payoff.</comment>
