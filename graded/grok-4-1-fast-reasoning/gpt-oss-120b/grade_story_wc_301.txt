<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Particular interiority shines in embodied ache post-medication and contradictory brokenness confessed to river; motivation to self-forgiveness compels tunnel pilgrimage with felt cost in endless returns. Flaw: diagnostic phrasing like "cartography of the soul" borders therapy-speak, softening peak impulses at river reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early pattern of map/graffiti taught, tightening at chalk poem discovery propelling to tunnel; closure Charged Poise in mud-map promise reconfigures stance with conceptual cost of "inevitable erosion" legible on page. Orientation anchored swiftly at arrival; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy micro-setting constrains path (swallows tiles, parts like curtains) and charges final image; accordion bellows as tool handled tactilely, resonating sigh in tunnel mirrors internal state. Sensory hierarchy (rust/rain, river murmur) selective via chronicler bias; spatial choreography coherent from station to vaulted echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness path) signaled early, textural escalation deepens via graffiti arrows narrowing to river confrontation; agency in tracing words, playing bellows forecloses forgetting with cost of perpetual pilgrimage visualized in mud map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-river emerges organically from graffiti/refracted image shifts; final whisper and humming bellows offer resonant non-literal reconfiguration reweighting past fears without moralizing. Minor slip: quoted poem line overt but anchored in scrawl.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in map-reference lens and chronicler idiom; rhythmic prose modulates from methodical steps to echoing sigh under reflective pressure. Voice particularizes noticing (accordions as breath-log), no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with images advancing texture, but paraphrase loops ("map references" thrice, "daringly methodical" repeated) and synonym churn (truthful/raw/echoing regret variants) dull propulsion in tunnel beat; metaphors consistent yet heavy, risking overwrite in peak resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bellows-tape patching as memory-stitch and graffiti-maps as soul-cartography transforms redemption trope; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, with river-self reflection as bold inflection heightening stakes organically.</comment>
