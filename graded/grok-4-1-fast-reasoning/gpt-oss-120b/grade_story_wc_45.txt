<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Forgiving skepticism embodied in hands "coaxing brittle bones" during repair, earning shift from doubt ("cleft in certainty") to hope via prior journal memory anchoring the constellation motif.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density tightens to "She set the last vertebra, feeling the garden inhale," delivering Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost in narrowed cleft becoming "gateway."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's "moss-cradled" body and pulsing roots constrain kneeling/repair choice and charge final "hedge walls exhale," mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Doubt-resolution stake deepens accumulatively via tooth placement narrowing options, with agency in alignment "clicks" forcing trade-off crystallized in fragile "embryonic galaxy" image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final redrawn maps with "subtle curvature of the baby tooth" offers non-literal answer to redemption question, reweighting mistakes-as-stars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("mapping each error onto a luminous pattern") sustains lyrical rhythm through peak stress in bone-setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in repair beats, but minor metaphor churn (repeated "cleft"/"constellations" echoes) dulls mid-propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tooth-vertebrae fusion transforms changeling trope into geometric redemption, risking bold synthesis that heightens closure stakes through "marrow...stitching a new map."</comment>
