<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Navigator's motivation to map loss drives consistent actions like assembling the engine, with embodied emotions in "weight of every name etched into the copper coils" and heart-sync pulse; endurance earns closure acceptance without tidy epiphany. Minor abstraction in "restless rhythm" slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from hydraulics failure to engine pulse and ships' arrival; closure as Charged Poise in "ships turn westward" reconfigures loss into hope with felt perseverance cost. Orientation anchored early in station details; single tightening via signal steadying suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains engine-building and charges final ritual lift; sensory details like "incense and rust" and moon-glint integrate purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Station's "cracked walls humming" evolves to sanctuary, grounding closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping loss tightens texturally through engine's moon-modulated roar, narrowing to reverse migration payoff; agency in building forecloses isolation path with sorrow-absorption cost legible in patina deepening. No reversal overload; quiet escalation fits lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss geography emerges organically from censer absorption and ship silhouettes mirroring constellations, offering non-literal resonance on reverse journeys without moralizing; final "bridge from loss to hope" reweights particulars ambiguously yet pointedly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias in map-sewn eyes and selective moon/censer noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to hum-roar under pressure, teaching poetic compression early for legible closure. No dialogue; voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "censer foot’s patina deepened" and moon echoes across beats dull propulsion slightly; figurative consistency taught as pattern pays off in closure image without muddle. Propulsion strong in "each metallic click resonated like a promise."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censer-as-compass navigating grief's "geography of loss" via reverse migration transforms tropes organically; risk in moon-driven engine heightens stakes, inevitable in ship-mirroring-constellations hindsight.</comment>
