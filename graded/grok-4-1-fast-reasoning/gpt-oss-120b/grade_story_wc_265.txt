<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to rediscover mind's frontier intensifies through embodied sensing of hum and culminates in earned realization at engine awakening; interiority concrete via gear's glow and vibrations. Minor slip: epiphany at "reclamation of internal wilderness" borders unearned without sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of hum and wind sounds builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: philosopher reweights external quest to internal with cost of "unraveling... rusted shut" thoughts legible on page. Orientation anchored early in mechanical rainforest; single tightening at dormant engine suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest vividly filters through POV's sixth-sense bias, with gear and pistoned moss constraining dream translocation and charging final "lantern" image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under insight urgency; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mental rediscovery escalates via hum's amplification and engine breath, narrowing to internal reclamation with felt cost of exposed raw thoughts. Protagonist agency in tracing vibrations and placing gear drives under Accumulative lens; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of internal wilderness emerges organically from gear placement and forest response, reweighting probable miracles as "natural rhythm" in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like amber veins avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in hum/vibration noticing; rhythmic prose modulates insight intensity purposefully. No head-hopping; voice texture biased to philosopher's synesthetic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with motifs like "hum of insight" patterned for propulsion, not loops; rhythm varies read-aloud without template cadence. Minor figurative density in canopy descriptions purposeful, but slight muddle in "painted the canopy in amber veins."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest and sleep translocation transforms philosopher-quest trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to internal payoff without gimmickry. Final gear-to-chest secures inevitable ingenuity.</comment>
