<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Abstract interiority favors poetic labels like "unsettlingly calm" over embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; pivotal realization lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from weaving to eruptions, dissolve, and bridge; CR closure lands on-page in "imagination can be measured" with conceptual cost of unreal's weight felt in bridge texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery and sinew thread as micro-setting constrain weaving choices and charge final bridge image; surreal details evolve purposefully through POV-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake deepens accumulatively via pattern intensification and eruptions narrowing to realization; agency in weaving forces trade-off but cost remains more conceptual than visceral on bridge step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection's texture emerges organically from weaving filaments to bridge; final image of coiled thread and pulsing world reweights logic/wonder premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward patterns/pulses; rhythmic prose modulates subtly with intensification, stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density high in peak eruption/weaving beats ("rippling like water disturbed by stone," "fractal arches that seemed to breathe") dulls propulsion slightly; purposeful "erupt"/"pulse" pattern avoids major loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architect weaving rational enchantment in responsive gallery transforms illusion trope; surreal risks heighten thematic stakes organically.</comment>
