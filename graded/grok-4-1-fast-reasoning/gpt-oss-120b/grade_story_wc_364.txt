<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meek blacksmith's resolve drives consistent choices from workshop to forge, with bartered memory embodying internal conflict and cost. Interiority poetic yet particular in "twin horizon of hope and doubt," avoiding stock phrasing. Mild contradictory impulses limit depth, but change feels earned via prior causality without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor density → mine entry → silk acquisition reconfigures options. Closure as Charged Poise in blade's azure song with bartered memory cost legible on-page ("offered the memory of his first failed forge"). Orientation anchored early in workshop/orchard; one tightening via tunnel hum suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: azure glyphs glow against gloom, constraining palm-press choice; crystal veins hum, mirroring internal pulse. Final forge under arches charges image, with floating rocks evolving from backdrop to resonant echo. POV bias filters via blacksmith's reverent rhythm; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience from rubble) signaled early, tightens via memory barter narrowing options under accumulative lens. Agency in deliberate palm-press and silk grasp; cost felt in "rubble of his past failures pulse like heartbeats." Escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakenings emerges organically from barter, silk infusion, and blade's rebuilding vines. Final image of azure defiance reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "every rubble could awaken." Resonance from particulars like fruit hums, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in reverent, humming motifs; diction/rhythm modulates from quiet doubt to firm resolve. Voice texture distinct in wind-caught silk simile; no head-hopping or withholding. Compression purposeful, taught early via rhythmic hammer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in cavern beat. Overwriting artifact: azure/reverent loops and paraphrase ("quietly determined" thrice, "each [strike/step] a promise") dull momentum without full pattern payoff, touching return beat. Minor template cadence in sequential actions; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: starlight silk barters memory for azure resilience on orchard planet transforms fantasy tropes via tactile hums and rebuilding blade. Risky poetic density heightens stakes; no template echoes, premise follows implications to sentinel forge.</comment>
