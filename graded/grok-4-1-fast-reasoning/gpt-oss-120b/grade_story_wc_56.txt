<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on label-speak like "hindsight clarity" and "serene upheaval" without embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; no visible flaws complicate the seeker's competence at the lock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with image density tightening at lock salvage (causal beat amid reflections) to charged poise CR closure; orientation anchored early, cost felt in unraveled scaffolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted lock and sundial constrain lock action precisely; recurring water reflections evolve to charge final gold-ribbon image, sensory details woven purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dismantle lies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lock halt/opposition and sundial agency to realization deepening; cost legible in foreclosed mythic narratives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth dismantling lies emerges organically from lock ripples and crumbling sandcastles; final sundial image offers non-literal CR reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with biased mythic perception (shadows, ripples as lies); rhythmic texture modulates serene-to-resolve without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "salvage" and "architecture of lies" across realizations, plus metaphor density ("sang through arches," "calm storm") muddles lock-beat clarity without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh mythic quest via sundial mechanics on barge transforms lie-tower trope; poetic synthesis feels inevitable in CR image, risking vignette form heightens resonance.</comment>
