<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and painter-specific in trembling fingers at shell, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during cave discovery; motivation intensifies to chest-settling eternity without deeper embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Charged Poise closure in pulsing canvas; orientation anchored early at quay; key reveal tightens meaningfully, though shell find borders coincidental without strong causal penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal cave network vividly selective via painterly senses (brine, glinting shell), guiding wrong-turn path and charging final easel image; recurring shells constrain return and mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise-keeping signaled early, with one deepening via key tying cave to studio chest; internal pressure coheres accumulatively but lacks narrowing trade-off, cost felt obliquely in aloof endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of tended moments stretching emerges organically from shell fragments and final pulse, resonant without statement; ambiguity in sea's "test" invites reflection via charged callback to mirror crack.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature (colors lingering longer than tides) stable in first-person; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites cave emergence ("brushstrokes of a tempest," "shattered mirror") without pressure payoff, dulling propulsion; some paraphrase loops on "promise" but rhythm varies purposefully overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painterly magic realism in glowing shell fragments realizing eternity; wrong-turn cave to painted chest transforms nostalgia trope organically without template echoes.</comment>
