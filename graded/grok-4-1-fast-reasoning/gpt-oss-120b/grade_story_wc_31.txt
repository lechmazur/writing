<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in luminous vow drives all actions credibly, with embodied perception like "meteor hush" particularizing Eli; final vow renewal shows earned endurance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, smoothing internal conflict into declarative pursuit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure in sigil formation ("binding truth and color together"), reweighting quest with ongoing cost legible in "keep seeking colors hidden in every sound." Orientation anchored early; purposeful wandering to hull provides motivated ellipsis without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken ship's hull and sea-glass windows constrain access via key, charging discovery; sensory hierarchy (ink/tide smell, vibrating hues) mirrors synesthetic quest. Recurring lantern glow evolves with internal states, selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover sound's color) signaled early, tightens texturally via library density and book ribbon revelation narrowing to fulfillment/cost of endless seeking. Agency in vow-guided choices forecloses complacency; lantern release adds subtle situational pressure without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of vows translating sound to color emerges organically via particulars like teal chord, resonant in sigil's non-literal reweighting without moralizing. Final pier/lantern image answers quest ambiguously, embracing complexity of perpetual seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature blending sound/color (e.g., "color of that chord was a deep teal"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to pulsing glow under revelation pressure. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but overwriting in revelation beat ("ribbon of sound that curled into a spiral of violet and amber") stacks metaphors without restraint, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops like repeated "luminous vow" add scaffold. Varied syntax supports ear test overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic premise transforms library trope into fresh sigil-map payoff, inevitable from vow setup; bold risk in sunken archive quest heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
