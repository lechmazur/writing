<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in lineage and truths, with concrete interiority via grandfather/mathematician recalls; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but final intervention earned through micro-choices like hypothesis typing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("orbits of regret had begun to unwind"); cost legible in observatory tremble/siren and nib handoff; orientation anchored early via stair/observatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory dome/console constrain choice via nib slot and charge final descent image; sensory hierarchy (hum like pages) POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ledger discovery) tightens via lattice projection/chime under Accumulative lens; agency in nib press forecloses false premise with felt responsibility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth via contradiction emerges organically from hypothesis/console to resonant final image unwinding regrets; non-literal answer reweights prior orbits without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (newsprint/stars bias); rhythmic poetic voice modulates effectively, dialogue natural/subtextual in brief exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak console beat ("lattice of possibilities," "etched a line") without full pattern payoff, triggering -0.6; minor loops in "solemn playfulness"/orbits phrasing; strong propulsion otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of news heiress, nib-proof observatory transforms tropes; risk-taking in conceptual machinery heightens stakes organically.</comment>
