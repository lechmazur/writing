<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; clock maker's inventiveness feels competent without genuine flaws or struggle compounding in pivotal yoyo-decoding beat. Interiority poetic yet abstract, leaning on embodied clichés like "pulsed through his veins" without character-particular degradation under stress. Final fulfillment reads unearned without micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrival → yoyo discovery → spinning/translation → stone amplification → key turn yields DC closure with beacon blaze reconfiguring fate. Orientation anchored early in arrival paragraph. Minor fluff in poetic asides doesn't break chain, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond discoveries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: sea spray, tide's "mournful rhythm," gears "grinding against the relentless tide" mirror internal drive and constrain access via low tide. Lighthouse floor cracks and yoyo burial ground actions tactile. Recurring stone/yoyo charge final image without overt symbolism; body/setting filter through clock-maker's gear bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock engine to transcend fate) signaled early, tightens via yoyo pattern discovery narrowing to gear ratios, but escalation accumulative without agency-testing reversal or visible trade-off in climax key-turn. Success lacks opposition, rendering cost (dimming stone) more symbolic than felt. Coheres causally but stakes abstractly viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of reverse-engineering fate emerges from yoyo/stone events, but final paragraph's "he had learned that to initiate change, one must first deconstruct the past" delivers overt moralizing echo, replacing resonant image with thesis. Subtext in beacon "pull[ing] the clouds apart" hints ambiguity, yet tidy resolution flattens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with clock/gear perceptual signature ("translating the yoyo's cycles into gear ratios"); rhythmic syntax modulates from arrival's breathy cadence to climax grind. No head-hopping or elision; voice distinct yet elevated diction occasionally drifts from craftsperson lexicon in poetic flourishes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High figurative density ("dying star," "thin ribbon") borders overwriting in yoyo-spin beat, muddling propulsion; "bleak exhilaration" and "latent radiance" loops paraphrase across lines without pattern payoff. Sentence variety strong, but template stems ("He [action-ed] the [object]") recur in tool-craft moment. Clarity holds, no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: counter-clockwise craft + yoyo cipher + hunger stone conduit transforms lighthouse myth into inevitable ingenuity triumph. Yoyo as "cipher... encoding... gear ratios" inflects tropes organically. Risky poetic tone heightens without gimmick; no derivative templates.</comment>
