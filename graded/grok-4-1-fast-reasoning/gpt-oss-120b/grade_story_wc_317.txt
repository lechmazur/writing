<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to innovate with the seed is consistent but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied flaws acting in scene; curiosity drives actions without deep internal tension. Triumph feels told rather than earned through struggle, with no visible cost foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds from seed arrival to bloom as Resonant Reconfiguration with awe as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in shed by brook; single tightening via participant solving to gust and quiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (earth scent, brook melody, silver rain moonlight) filter through Mara's priorities and constrain design (vents, panels); brook and skylight charge final bloom image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed blooming via puzzles) signaled early with one tightening: panel ciphers release gust to shiver tray. Pressure accumulates texturally but remains low-key wonder over narrowing options; cost legible in design effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of innovation via unconventional paths emerges organically from seed-to-bloom arc; final petals as "map of constellations" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting mystery motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (noticing whispers, thrums); rhythmic prose modulates hush to surge, no head-hopping. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure bloom ("petals unfurled like a map of constellations drawn in vapor") without muddling closure; minor loops like repeated "storm-born silence" drag rhythm. Varied syntax propels but some paraphrase in descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room with living corpse flower responsive to riddles transforms puzzle trope; orthogonal vents and mood-receptive seed feel organic and riskily poetic.</comment>
