<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Librarian's vow roots motivation in harmonious traits, compelling retrieval and conduction; interior shown via "vigorous and tender" gestures, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as chime density builds to choral bridges and unified city as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "healed more than stone" and foreclosed industrial scars; orientation anchored early in tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tower alcove and silos constrain weight retrieval and bridge-building; borrowed starlight recurs to charge final dew-glimmer image, with sensory sound hierarchy via POV's musical ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to heal via song signaled in vow, tightens accumulatively as rumble yields chorus forcing worker emergence and planks; agency in drop/conduction forecloses isolation with felt storm-guidance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of art bridging divides emerges via etched planks and silo stories; final humming bridges reweight scars non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature biasing sound/images; rhythmic modulation tender under pressure, no dialogue or slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Musical rhythm propels but paraphrase loops ("hush of borrowed starlight" x2, "grain elevator talks" phrasing) and figurative density in every peak sentence dull immediacy without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of singing silos and linguistic bridges transforms industrial tropes; risk in lyric elevation of librarian's conduction heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
