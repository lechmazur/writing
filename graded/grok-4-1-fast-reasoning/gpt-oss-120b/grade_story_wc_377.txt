<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in preservation endurance shines through tending actions like tightening joints, but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under dramatized pressure; static competence without struggle limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure in final "hope glistens" image; cost of perpetual tending against fading legible in "refuses to surrender to darkness," orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment as micro-setting constrains craft and charges final image with glisten/hum; sensory details like wind-pushed arm vivid and purposeful, filtered through tuner's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early but escalation minimal under lens—no decisive tightening narrows options, pressure accumulative yet low without opposition or trade-off; cost felt obliquely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved in silence emerges organically via motion/images, final image offers resonant CR reweighting muteness as triumph without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature on glisten/motion; rhythmic poetic texture modulates effectively, but minor register elevation in peaks borders opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("glisten" 7x, "mute/muted" cluster, "symphonies" echoes) create paraphrase churn in final third (−1.2), dulling propulsion despite purposeful lyric rhythm; density high but artifacts obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinetic ice symphony transforms silence trope into vivid preservation; iceberg/arm originality inevitable in hindsight, risks bold lyric structure coherently.</comment>
