<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's patient traits drive concrete micro-choices like decoding the piano via her mother's lullaby, earning her final freedom with felt chain cost. Interiority particular through embodied grace under chains; no major contradictions but competence balanced by cautious pacing. Minor flaw: motivation told early without initial friction, but scales well to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: piano decoding → stair reveal → arrow key → vault open → seed plant → wall fall/chain loose as DC with legible cost in her rusted freedom. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity. Closure reconfigures stakes via inscription payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phosphorescent fungi and piano bench constrain descent and puzzle, charging final seed-plant image. Sensory details (clinking chains, green glow) selective via Mara's priorities, mirroring resolve. Carnival ruins evolve causally to crumbling wall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed retrieval for famine) tightens via piano puzzle reversal, narrowing options with guardian threat. Agency in patient decoding forecloses intrusion path; cost legible in chain-bound effort and dry-soil plant. Escalation mild but coherent under causal lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges via seed pod weight and wall-fall CR, reweighting ruins-to-renewal without morals. Inscription subtly answers "wall" metaphor through events; final shoot cracks crust as non-literal resonance. Particulars like fletching constellations avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (honoring air, lullaby resonance); lyrical rhythm modulates from caution to triumph. No dialogue; diction particular (staggering grace) reflects resolve. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short clicks amid longer imagery); density high, metaphors purposeful like "skeletal witnesses." Minor overwrite in repeated grace phrasing (−0.4), but no loops or artifacts dull closure seed image. Propulsion strong to wall sigh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival vault, fletched-arrow key, and chained gardener transforms post-apoc tropes via piano lullaby decode. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes organically; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight payoff in shoot/jasmine.</comment>
