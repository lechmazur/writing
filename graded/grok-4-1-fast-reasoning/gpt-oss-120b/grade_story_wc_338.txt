<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent traits like methodically curious drive concrete actions (tracing glyphs, repositioning projector), earning the realization that the tear is a portal; internal conflict subtle in shielded openness amid grief, embodied via trembling arm and whispered voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: alignments build density from setup to merged projections, landing CR closure in "soft glow emerged... muted chorus" with conceptual cost of rewritten borders; orientation anchored early in vault entry, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (wet plaster smell, rain drumming, bruised sky vs. pallid drizzle) filters through POV priorities, constraining choices via projector/wall/map overlay; recurring cracked stone charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen chapel via silence interpretation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening alignments narrowing to glyphs/revelation; agency in repositioning merges timelines with felt grief cost legible in "intangible grief of a community."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy rewriting silence/borders emerges organically from map tear portal and aligned videos; final image reweights premise non-literally via "earth itself... trying to rewrite the boundary," lingering ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in noticing faint lines/shadows/silences; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences in alignments), purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but figurative overload (bruised sky, pulsing scar, breathing vault) in most sentences dulls peak alignment beats; minor synonym loops on "silence/quiet/mute" and paraphrase in map tear descriptions drag momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-framing videos/henge as portal for silence dialogue transforms mythic tropes; risk in accumulative video-merge structure heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via glyph emergence.</comment>
