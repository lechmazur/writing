<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Odd historian's sensitively perceptive trait drives embodied discoveries like feeling page tremors and wall vibrations, aligning actions with motive to collect wall stories; earns realization without raw contradiction but with competent struggle via fragmented evidence. Final endurance of purpose shows visible cost in world's resonant shift. No other characters, so voice coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds from diaries/tapestry patterns to humming/vibration, culminating in chamber shiver and CR closure ("displaced axis is not a fracture but a realignment") with conceptual cost in final image of gathered stories pulsing. Orientation anchored early (silo library, post-dream world); one tightening via descent shards fits scope; pattern taught, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo library, tapestry fragment, and half-burnt diaries constrain choices (pressing against brick, descending to glyphs) and charge closure image; sensory hierarchy (soot smell, metallic taste, hum vibration) reflects POV's perceptual bias, evolving with descent. Micro-setting (central stone) pulses at climax, mirroring internal resonance without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe axis mystery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via diary patterns/humming to chamber activation, narrowing to protagonist's endurance/renunciation of fracture view; agency in probing forces stance crystallization with felt cost (humanity's sigh, mind humming). One decisive deepening suffices; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory realigning world's axis emerges organically from fragment alignments and wall resonance, culminating in non-literal CR final image ("stories walls have heard are finally being gathered") that reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity in "gentle turning" invites reflection via charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (murmurs, sighs, tilts as tactile); rhythmic prose ("bronze quiet cadence") modulates serenely, compressing discoveries without head-hopping or withholding; voice texture purposeful for lyric accumulative mode, perceptual bias character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory/prose rhythm without loops, though "bronze quiet" motif risks template feel but teaches pattern early for payoff; figurative coherence (compass shards, low tide vibration) propels without muddle in peak chamber beat; varied syntax breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo librarian probing "displaced axis" via dragons/diaries transforms tropes through resonant fragments and perceptual quest; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable wall-memory premise, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
