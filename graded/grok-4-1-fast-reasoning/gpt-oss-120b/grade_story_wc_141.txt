<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Selene's curiosity as myth-buster motivates placing the shell and retelling the legend, with embodied gloom-cheer in her tugging smile amid dust and hum. Interiority particular but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure; mentor's voice feels summoned conveniently without cost. Final endurance of wonder earned but lacks visible flaw complication at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hums, vibrations, ledger builds to CR closure where myths' endurance reconfigures her pursuit with curiosity's cost, legible in "stubborn optimism" and light descent. Orientation anchored early (Voss at observatory). Single scene fits scope; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: wind-page-turns, cello's mournful hum, shell's shifting glow mirror internal curiosity, constraining choices like ledger discovery behind telescope. Cliff observatory evolves with events (dome whispers riddle). Recurring shell/cello charge final image, enabling 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shell's hum to cello's response and ledger's verses, narrowing to renunciation of solving vs. retelling. Agency in retelling weaves pressure; cost felt in foreclosed "dismantling" purity at "myths survive when retold." Mild abstractness tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (myths endure via art/curiosity) emerges organically from retelling through cello hums, reweighting riddle in final image of lingering echo without moral state. Subtext in shell's pulse implies ongoing cost; avoids binaries. Borders overtness in "simple, cheering truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: mythic bias filters observatory (seashell as talisman/compass). Lyrical rhythm modulates from gloomy to bright, fitting accumulative lens; purposeful compression in hum motifs taught early. No dialogue; diction controlled but elevated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>High density but artifacts drag: paraphrase loops ("resonant hums" x3, "gloomy cheerfulness" x2, "painted seashell" churn) across descriptive runs, dulling momentum; template cadence in stacked metaphors ("conduits that reimagines... each note a recollection"). Closure image propels but overwritten ("needle trembling like a laugh caught in a storm"). Overwriting in peak hum-rise beat penalizes heavily.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: myth-busting meets magic-realist cello-seashell compass decoding endurance of wonder, transforming tropes via textured hums/ledger. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no close echoes, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
