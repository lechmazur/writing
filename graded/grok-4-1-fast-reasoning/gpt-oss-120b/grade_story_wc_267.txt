<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bellhop's actions align with silent duty, but guests remain collective abstraction without individual contradictory impulses or embodied emotions; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, as in the vague "whispered doubts."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via motif density (silence, discoloration shift after bolt) to Charged Poise closure in guests' emergence with "new understanding that safety's price...willingness to bear silence"; cost legible in final acceptance, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting anchors early (cobalt walls, spiral staircase) and charges final image via bolt on discolored step mirroring internal costs; sensory selection (shimmering sapphire, frost-lined tiles) purposeful, subtly guiding signal via proximity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand cost of safety) signaled early, tightens via bolt-induced discoloration shift aligning "internal currents"; agency in bellhop's placement forecloses fracture illusion with felt pause in regeneration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as safety's cost emerges organically from bolt's pulse, shifting hues, and final "memory of the discoloration"; resonant non-literal answer in guests carrying trace, reweighting hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with lyrical perceptual bias toward hues/silence; voice texture distinct in rhythmic motifs, modulates to charged poise at end without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition (frostbitten hope, unpardonable silence) teaches lyric pattern but incurs minor paraphrase loops around silence descriptors; figurative density high yet legible, propulsion strong in shift moment "amber tint deepening into a warm copper."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane bolt as heartbeat signal in seraphic silence transforms isolation tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
