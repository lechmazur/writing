<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits via restoration is rooted in traits and intensifies through embodied actions like needle punctures feeling like heartbeats. Interior conflict in "lucid unrest" shows contradictory calm/unease acting simultaneously during knot unraveling. Final resolve earned by prior micro-choices, foreclosing mask's yearning with felt personal cost in her settling unrest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds via knot releases to RR closure in net collapse and mask's thrumming pulse, reconfiguring grief to peace with conceptual cost of tamed yearning legible in "no longer yearning to break free." Single scene anchored early ("prism sanctuary under starlight, broken mask restorer named Elara"). Persistent constraint of net's memories shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism walls refract starlight into muted cascades that settle like dust, constraining choices by dimming light via hush accumulation and charging final image where colors shift to breathing gradient. Sensory hierarchy (humming air, echoing water, pulsing needle) reflects Elara's priorities, integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting of altar/net guides unraveling with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via net unraveling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as each knot releases flickering spirits, narrowing to last knot's collapse with agency in patient piercing. Tightening reweights via deepening hush density, forcing trade-off of unrest for stasis; cost felt in sanctuary's inhale and Elara's resolve. No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient hush taming grief emerges organically from net's memory-knots and mask fragments, culminating in resonant final image of softened starlight as muted hymn reweighting loudest grief without moral. Subtext in whispers and sighs invites ambiguity of unrest-to-peace. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic hush-weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: hush as palpable weight, selective bias toward silence-stitching. Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity (short punctures amid flowing descriptions), purposeful compression taught early via needle's pulse. No head-hopping; diction reflects restorer's rune-etched worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (expanding walls mirror breaths), high density in images like "cascade of muted colors that settled like dust." Minor −0.4 for hush-synonym loops ("interlaced hush," "hush that accumulates") across peak beats, but pattern-taught and legible without obscuring closure's mask-thrum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restoration via fisherman's net hush-weaving transforms grief-taming tropes into inevitable pattern, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final thread-winding recharges premise uniquely; no derivative echoes.</comment>
