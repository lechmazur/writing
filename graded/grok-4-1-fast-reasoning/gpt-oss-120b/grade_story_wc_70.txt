<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder drives the key-turning incitement and confession climax, rooted in truthful trait that forces honest hope-sharing. Interiority concrete via trembling voice and cool weight felt on reaching box. Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized than simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal drone emergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from blackout fade to glyph rearrangement, yielding CR closure where echo reprices hive failure as pause with conceptual cost in sealed box's promise. Orientation anchored early (Mara at humming tower base). One tightening via key compartment suffices; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lightning tower and lacquer box constrain choices (key access) and charge final image (box breathing amber). Sensory vivid/selective: oily sheen, faint hum, amber veins through rods mirror internal revival. Specificity POV-filtered via toll-keeper priorities; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive wonder post-hive failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via riddle-to-glyphs deepening that reweights loss. Agency in box-opening and key-turn forecloses routine dimness with felt cost in hoped confession. Coheres under lens to Charged Poise at echo realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (wonder echoing from routine loss) emerges organically from glyph "Echo" reveal reweighting hive failure without moralizing. Final image (sealed box, lingering citizens) offers non-literal answer, charging prior blackout with resonance. Subtext in honeyed light motif avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: sky's fireworks, mechanical colonies via keeper's wonder-lens. Voice texture poetic yet biased (truthful confessions), rhythm modulates to hush at tolls. No head-hopping; elision of compartment taught/payable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Density high, propulsion via varied syntax in sparks-to-drone cascade. Minor artifacts: hum/buzz repetition purposeful but borders loop in hive backstory; dense metaphors (amber veins, electric nectar) coherent without muddle at closure. No scaffold; rhythm read-aloud strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lightning-harvesting tower with riddle-key reviving drone echo transforms post-apoc routine into organic wonder. Risky poetic conceit inevitable in hindsight via glyph payoff; no template echoes.</comment>
