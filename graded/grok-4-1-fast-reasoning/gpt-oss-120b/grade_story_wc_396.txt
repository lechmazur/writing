<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in intuitive sensing drives reconstitution, with embodied actions like aligning shards under mirror light; interiority concrete in pulse rhythms but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, feeling more declarative than conflicted. No stock phrasing, but epiphanic recall of manuscript tilts toward summary over micro-choice friction. Final resolve earns change via prior cues, scaled appropriately.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard pulse to mirror ripples and alignment, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as crystal wholes and orchard blooms, reweighting cold silence with renewal cost legible in "defied the ice’s endless chill." Orientation anchored early in orchard/ice setup. One tightening via reflections suffices; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: lantern glow on frosted roots, ticking steps on ice hulls, mirrors sighing ripples constrain alignment choice and charge final golden aura. POV bias filters via intuitive pulse-sensing; no white-room, spatial choreography clear from orchard to van. Recurring crystal/mirrors evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute anomaly against cold) signaled early via shard pulse; textural escalation deepens via mirror futures narrowing to alignment action, forcing empathy trade-off with resolve's cost felt in "fractured heart pulse in rhythm." Agency in hands guided by glimpses; one decisive intensification reweights options coherently. Moral calculus sharpens in child/sailor reflections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared empathy/action emerges organically from shard rite and mirror glimpses, resonating in final "world breathe in unison" image reweighting isolation without stating moral. Particulars like ice spirits/council avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "anomalies become ordinary" counter-reading. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pulse/breath/rhythm noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from wavering glow to steady beam poise under pressure. No head-hopping or filter excess; purposeful compression in reflections legible, charging closure. Voice texture distinct, syntax reflects intuitive mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow inhale to pulsing brighter); high density in mirrors scattering light into futures advances all layers without loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent (ripples stitching histories) in lyric pattern taught early; no template cadence, strong verbs propel. Minor density in light/pulse recurrences purpose-driven, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard/ice, shard-mirror rite transforms crystal trope into empathetic anomaly guide; bold lyric risk heightens renewal stakes without gimmick. Turns like reflections guiding hands inevitable from intuitive cues; no derivative echoes, perspective memorable in breath-syncing world.</comment>
