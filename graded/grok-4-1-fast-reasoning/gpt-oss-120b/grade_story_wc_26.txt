<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through sharp-eyed perception and embodied actions like lifting the stone, but slips into diagnostic labels like "luminous regret" undermine specificity in the revelation beat. Micro-choices under pressure (aligning stone with footage) reveal values with felt cost in regret-to-gratitude shift. Earned endurance preserves hope without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns in footage and stone alignment deepen knowledge toward CR closure where stone warms and footage brightens, reweighting shadow with cost of faded moments. Orientation anchored early (dusk noticer in cloud library). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV (stained glass twilight, blooming vines rustling); recurring stone constrains choice (alignment) and charges final image (cradled against chest). Sensory hierarchy matches calm observation, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope) signaled early, textural escalation via footage comparison and stone warming narrows options, forcing endurance with legible cost in "luminous regret." Agency in deliberate alignment drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving hope emerges organically from patterns and metamorphosis, resonant CR in kite silhouette unbound reweights prior loss without moralizing. Complexity lingers in regret's melt into gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sharp dusk-eyes catching shadows); lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, prose texture biased toward twilight details. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (watercolor skies, ribs of wing), but minor paraphrase loops ("softly deliberate," "shadow unbound") and heavy metaphors in revelation slightly dull propulsion. Rhythm varies, no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic archivist in cloud library transforms preservation trope via footage-stone method; risk-taking in lyric accumulative voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
