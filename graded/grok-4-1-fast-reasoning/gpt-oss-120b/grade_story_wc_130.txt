<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in "pulse of hope rise beneath his ribs," rooting motivation in compassionate curiosity; micro-choices like aligning eyes reveal values. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: realization reframes loss as "subtraction that made room for a new addition," cost legible in transformation. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in orchard under moon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dripping stalactites recur as micro-setting, translating vibrations into numbers and charging final image with silver notes and dew-shimmering bridge. Sensory details selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of emotion in loss) deepens texturally via wind/drips and incantation under lens, narrowing to hopeful reconfiguration. Agency in tracing and whispering forces stance crystallization with felt cost of acknowledged sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-transformation emerges organically from glass eyes on mosaic, culminating in resonant equation image without moralizing. Final petals reprise sight, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of grief's necessary subtraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with math-mystic perceptual signature ("angles converged," "pattern of numbers"); syntax/rhythm modulate beautifully under pressure. Stable close third-person POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with incantatory cadence, high density in image-packed lines; purposeful lyric figuration consistent without muddle. Minor loops in "softly/gently" and loss phrasing slightly dull propulsion, but no scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, mosaic math, and emotional equations transforms mystical tropes organically. Risky lyric conceit on grief's geometry feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via fragile invention.</comment>
