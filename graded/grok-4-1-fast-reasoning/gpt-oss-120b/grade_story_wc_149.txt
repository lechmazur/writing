<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to repay debt clear and consistent, intensifying through repetitive visits to compel final sigh; embodied longing in "sigh that tasted of roses and rust." Lacks concrete internal contradiction or micro-choices acting simultaneously; poetic traits feel archetypal rather than particularized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of appearances and bead activations builds to RR closure in bride's fading and orchard bloom, with felt cost in her scattering veil. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one tightening via progressive vine changes narrows to transformative sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "metallic hymn" and "frost-melted" edges integrate into action; greenhouse and vines constrain her gliding/planting, charging final blooming image. POV-biased (ghostly): ash veil and endless night mirror internal debt without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, accumulates texturally through resonant visits tightening to final venomous sigh that forecloses her presence with dissolution cost. Agency in placements and whisperings drives escalation; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive debt via resonance emerges organically from particulars like bead and vines; final bead-pulsing image offers non-literal repricing of "love that was both gentle and poisonous." Lingers with ambiguity of mournful elation, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: alchemical-lyric noticing (e.g., "sigils that glowed faintly whenever a memory resurfaced"). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity, consistent diction; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in rhythmic sentences, but patterned repetition ("resonant awakening," "each time") borders paraphrase loops across vine beats, dulling mid-section momentum without full payoff. Figurative strain in "breath of fire, the taste of molten hope" mixes without coherence in reflective block; closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride repaying alchemical debt transforms tropes via bead-resonance mechanic; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens poetic stakes. Final orchard-thrumming reconfigures premise inevitably from particulars.</comment>
