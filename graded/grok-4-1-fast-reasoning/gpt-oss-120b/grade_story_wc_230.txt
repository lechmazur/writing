<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rational forager traits drive motivated hiding of the eye, with involuntary truth compelling the pivotal speech to smugglers; embodied in "truth...surged like a sapling." Minor slip in tidy rational arcs without strong simultaneous contradictions caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: eye hidden, smugglers silenced by glow, fragile safety blooms with felt communal cost in final exhale image. Orientation anchored early in ravine/orchard/virus world; single scene causality intact via trek-to-clearing tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard constrains trek ("slick bark") and seals moss, charging closure as "quiet sentinel" mirroring secrets; sensory hierarchy (rustle, brine, thunder) reflects forager bias. Recurrent roots/breath evolve with action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate safety via eye vs. smugglers' greed) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to truth-speech reversal narrowing options; agency in hiding/speaking forecloses greed path with visible cost in their eclipsed silence. Enters 8+ as trade-off charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reflected truth binding post-virus empathy emerges organically from eye/mirror images shifting to communal cultivation; final tending reweights without moral. "Psychological safety" near-echo in narration docks slightly for subtext explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (fungal metaphors like "mushroom's spore," "cap of moss") biases noticing; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in truth-burst. Rhythmic modulation heightens pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in peak hiding beat ("frozen tear," "hollow that seemed to watch") mixes metaphors without pattern payoff (−0.5); minor "fractured grace" loops. Closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of virus-ravaged orchard, truthful forager, grief-reflecting eye transforms relic trope into empathy covenant; risk in poetic compression inevitable in hindsight via eye's glow silencing smugglers.</comment>
