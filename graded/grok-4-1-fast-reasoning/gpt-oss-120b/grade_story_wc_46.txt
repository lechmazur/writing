<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to share light without fire drives consistent micro-choices like arranging glass, but interiority remains abstract and serene without sharply contradictory impulses or embodied stress; rooftop memory anchors reflection per BRR without flattening pressure. Final realization of purpose feels declarative rather than wrung from contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meditative beats build density toward Conceptual Repricing in final glass placement and pearl pulse, reweighting earthbound longing with cost of anchoring distant stars to tangible quiet. Orientation anchored early in grotto entry; single scene coherent, no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine walls, mist, and pool constrain and mirror actions, charging final spiral with tactile coolness and ripples; sea glass as micro-setting evolves from raw shards to lanterns, integrated via polishing and chant. Sensory bias (scent of zephyr bloom, humming glass) reflects POV's luminous priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire signaled early, accumulates texturally through polishing and spiral to Charged Poise in purpose settling; one deepening in chant's responsive chords narrows to communal peace, with felt cost in memory's weight. Lacks sharper agency-driven turn foreclosing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of gentle illumination emerges organically from glass spiral and pearl glow mirroring internal/external quietude, resonant in final "softest glow...illuminate darkest paths without burning" without moralizing. Particulars like rooftop memory reweight premise via CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of cosmic reflection (glass mirroring night sky); lyrical rhythm modulates from drifting entry to pulsing closure, diction purposeful in undulating syntax. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath, high density in image-stacked lines like "zephyr bloom of syllables," but patterned repetition ("reflectively vibrant," "weigh") borders paraphrase loop across polishing beat, slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in metaphors everywhere mutes peak chant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms star-gazing trope into earthbound ritual of non-fiery light via sea glass spiral; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens meditative stakes organically.</comment>
