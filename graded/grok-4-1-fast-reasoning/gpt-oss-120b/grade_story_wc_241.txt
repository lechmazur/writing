<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in probability-gambling inheritance and mother's death compels quest choices effectively; contradictory impulses between certainty and chance act in scene via coin placement and scrawl interpretation. Final theorem feels earned by prior micro-choices like tracing ratios. Minor label ("theoretically rebellious") slightly abstracts traits without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal actions + textural symbol density) holds to CR closure: theorem-writing reconfigures certainty/chance premise with felt cost in sputtering flame and lingering loss. Orientation anchored early (Mara enters library post-mother's attack). Pivotal coin-on-equation click and mica-kiss shift cascade cleanly to ledger and map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mica pane in lantern constrains choices (flame-kiss reveals symbols) and charges final image (reflects labyrinth on ledger). Sensory details (old paper/thunder, phosphorescent walls) filtered through probability POV, evolve with descent/ascent. Library/subway veins mirror internal chaos purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace lucid contradictions) signaled early, tightens via interpretive agency narrowing paths (coin click, ratio to ledger, mica reveal) under hybrid lens; one deepening suffices. Final theorem crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (forecloses strict probability). Coherent pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lucid contradictions theme emerges organically from equation scrawls and theorem; final ledger/lantern image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting probability premise. Subtext in gambling inheritance vs. responsible widening avoids morals. Ambiguity lingers in "balanced insight" without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature (equations as directions, shadows as possibility veins); voice texture poetic/lyric, modulated for intensity. Purposeful compression in symbol density taught early, legible at closure. Minor overwriting risks filter-like distance in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure beats (e.g., "prism of shadows... veins of possibility" stacks metaphors without pattern payoff, dulling discovery clicks); "clover melancholy" loops twice without escalation. Some paraphrase redundancy (ledger as "odds and outcomes" restated). Propulsion intact but rhythm clotted by modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Probability puzzles in hidden subway/library transform quest trope freshly; scrawl equations as navigation synthesize gambling academia organically. Risky lyric texture heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick. Final wanderer-guiding lantern inflects hindsight inevitability.</comment>
