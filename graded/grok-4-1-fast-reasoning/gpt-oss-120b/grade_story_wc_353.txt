<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Auris's motivation to create music intensifies credibly through micro-choices like placing the reed and decoding each crack, earning the realization at "Auris smiled, realizing that empathy in motion was not a hollow ideal." Interiority concrete in embodied details like the grove "breathing...with his heart," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as strumming density builds vibrations into shared melody, with on-page Conceptual Repricing closure at "the grove finally heard a song...a melody of shared breath," reweighting silence via felt cost of decoding "the last crack." Single continuous scene anchors orientation early ("siskin alder grove...tree-song sculptor"). No lens ambiguity or shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator as micro-setting constrains by "resonating...humming faintly...trembling like a glass harp, yet never shattering," charging final image and pivotal strumming beats. Sensory details selective (dappled light on glaze, reed vibrations) reflect Auris's priorities. Grove evolves causally from hush to "air thrummed with invisible threads."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music in silent world) signaled early tightens accumulatively via "each new note forced him to study a different stress crack," narrowing to last crack's "sorrow" with agency-driven cost in patient decoding. Escalation driven by Auris under lens, cost legible in sculpture's "pain...translated" and fragile porcelain's tremble. No reversal needed; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence stitched by empathy emerges organically from strumming cracks into "chords of silence," culminating in resonant CR: "even the deepest silence can be a canvas...music awakens." Final image recharges prior material without moralizing. Avoids platitudes via concrete particulars like reed in veins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: symphonic noticing ("leaves whispered like distant flutes," "vibration traces the crack’s lineage"). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates consistently, purposeful repetition taught early as pattern. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density in action lines like "placed a slender reed between two broken veins, and as he strummed gently," but patterned repetition ("strumming," "crack," "silence") borders paraphrase loops across beats, dulling peak momentum without full payoff. Figurative coherence strong (bark into "chords," porcelain as "resonant bridge"), rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor scaffold in redundant hush descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms mute grove into empathy-orchestrated symphony via irreplaceable porcelain-wood strumming, feeling inevitable in hindsight from "analyzing stress cracks" to "living archive of cracks turned into chords." Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry; fresh synthesis of sculpture, insulator, hedgehog dance.</comment>
