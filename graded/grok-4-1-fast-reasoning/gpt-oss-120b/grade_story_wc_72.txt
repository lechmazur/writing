<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Living statue's motivation is clear but abstractly told without contradictory impulses acting in scene; no embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure reveal internal conflict. Incisively kind trait is labeled repeatedly rather than shown through tradeoffs. Final purpose fulfillment feels declared, not earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of revelations building to Charged Poise RR in garden's thrumming possibilities; threading filament through dome weakness provides one meaningful tightening. Orientation anchored early in underwater garden. Conceptual cost legible in "deepest certainties could be softened by a single, kindly thread."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (phosphorescent currents, violet veins, brine sigh) filter through statue's telepathic perception, constraining choices like threading structural weakness. Setting evolves causally (mosaics crystallize, arch repaired) and charges final image of alive yet immobile garden. Micro-setting (cracked dome, kelp fronds) guides action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (welcoming nuance into certainty) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via coaxing kelp/statues and repairing arch, narrowing ossified myths. Agency in telepathic whispers and threading forces trade-off with visible conceptual cost at closure. Escalation coherent under lens with one decisive intensification sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nuance softening certainty emerges organically from particulars like kelp mimicking veins and dormant statues inhaling pulse, without direct statement. Final image ("guardians of nuance, forever threading kindness through the cracks") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. Avoids tidy morals via lingering paradox of animate lifelessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (telepathic whispers to kelp, sensing stone hearts pulsing); rhythmic syntax modulates serenely without head-hopping. Purposeful mythic diction and compression suit lyric mode, taught early and legible at closure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("cascading revelations," "threading... through cracks," "nuance into certainty") across multiple sentences create synonym churn and template cadence, dulling propulsion in revelatory beats. Mixed metaphors (filament through dome like tides unfurling) and overwriting obscure cause/effect without pattern payoff. Artifacts touch closure image, triggering −1.7 cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic statue in underwater garden transforms lifeless/animate trope via telepathic choreography and structural weakness threading. Bold lyric risk-taking heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Core premise feels inevitable in hindsight through iridescent mosaics and bioluminescent repair.</comment>
