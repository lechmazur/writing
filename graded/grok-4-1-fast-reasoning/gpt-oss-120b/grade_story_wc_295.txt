<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode via dreams intensifies credibly through glyph-star match, earning change in shared burden lift; embodied doubt as "weight settle in her chest" reveals under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motif density (stars, burdens) drives CR closure at temple door opening with shared cost legible in "weight lift, not removed but shared"; orientation anchored early in observatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory dome and telescope constrain alignment choice; variable stars charge final chamber image, sensory details (daylily scent, ozone) selectively mirror internal shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to decode tightens accumulatively via dream glyphs to star alignment, narrowing to whisper/share act; agency in telescope lift forecloses solitary doubt with felt relief cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges organically from telegram to crystal reprise, reweighting solitude in final dawn image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in scent/pulse biases; rhythmic modulation supports lyric build, though some elevated diction drifts from embodied crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("shared burdens" x8, "midnight solace" loops) and paraphrase redundancy (weight lift variations) create template cadence across revelation beat, dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Variable stars decoding ancient glyphs transforms dream chronicle trope into fresh celestial method, inevitable in crystal confirmation.</comment>
