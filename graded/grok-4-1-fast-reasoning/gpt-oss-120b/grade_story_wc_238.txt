<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied regret (perfume on wrist vibrates) and micro-choices (arranging pages into spiral) rooted in flaw of past scandal; motivation to apologize intensifies through Mara memory cued by present ritual. Minor slip in unearned epiphany phrasing at sheet's descent ("cracked saint"). Contradictory impulses subtle in hesitation before whispering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from bottle placement to sheet flutter (pattern break), cadence to Charged Poise closure in final chord/apology echo with felt cost ("weight lift"). Orientation anchored early (archive, exorcist, orchard hush). Single tightening sufficient; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains ritual choices (coaxing vibrations) and charges final image (rests as witness); sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) reflects POV urgency. Archive/orchard evolve causally (glow crawls shelves, wind threads score). 9+ gate met via constraint on apology tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver apology) signaled early, tightens via sheet descent (agency-driven under accumulative lens, foreclosing failure). Cost legible in imperfect success ("not wholly healed") charging orchard fall. One deepening reweights to redemption without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via imperfect miracles emerges from particulars (torn pages spiral, vapor words); final image (lingering echo beyond silence) offers non-literal resonance reweighting gossip-to-grace arc. No moralizing; ambiguity in "gritty miracles" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (metaphors as noticing: "broken chord," "loose pages"); rhythmic prose modulates to ethereal under ritual pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice particular via verse-whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in peak beat (glow, vapor, incense) mixes vehicles slightly; minor paraphrase loop on "imperfect miracle" (three echoes dulls). Rhythm varies on read-aloud; no template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip-exorcist ritualizes apology via electric perfume in music archive transforms tropes organically. Risky ethereal grit heightens stakes; turn at fluttering sheet ("Apology to Mara") inevitable from prior currents.</comment>
