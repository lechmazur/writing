<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Selene's interiority relies on abstract labels like "uncommonly serene" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; epiphanies feel told via summaries ("she believed," "she imagined") rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation and build to CR closure ("strings of conscience unspooling... ribbons of starlight"); cost legible in dying ember and settling ash, though tightening is subtle via waning fire and wind cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's inward parabolic dishes and cracked concrete constrain staging as reflective stage and supply echoing hush/wind that charge final darkness image; sensory details (ember glow, pine scent) filter through Selene's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Internal stake of ethical epiphanies signaled early tightens accumulatively to revelation narrowing narrative control options; lacks visceral price or agency-driven turn, with abstract pressure never viscerally testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reversing exploitation emerges organically via dishes/puppet strings motif shifting to autonomy grant; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, though direct articulation ("less about dictating truth and more about offering") borders moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/hush-biased noticing); purposeful poetic diction and rhythm modulate reflective intensity without slippage, suiting lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwritten figurative density (e.g., "ember-kissed tip flickering like a quiet comet," "ribbons of starlight") in most sentences dulls propulsion; paraphrase loops on "half-lit epiphany" and "meteor hush" across reflective beats obscure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher's ink-tracing in dome-as-puppet-stage transforms ethical storytelling tropes; reversal motif risks bold lyric structure heightening closure without gimmickry.</comment>
