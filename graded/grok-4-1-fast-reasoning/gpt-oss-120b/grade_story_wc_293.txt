<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in legend and glass flake compels trek and vow, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; serenity dominates over embodied crisis. Final vow feels earned via causality but not charged by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Charged Poise/CR at summit (glass image emerges, veil unravels); cost legible in "weight of the moment settle like ash." One tightening via ridge play suffices; orientation anchored early at pullout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scaffold map and wet-plate glass constrain trek choices and charge final image (glass on stone, glows with amnesty); sensory details (wind traces letters, pine needles) selective via POV observation. No white-room; evolves causally to summit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate amnesty for vanished hitchhiker) signaled early via legend; tightening at summit play narrows to reweight "never" with agency. Cost felt in hammered heart and ash-like weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption from "never" emerges organically via music-glass merger; final image (glowing wet-plate as doorway) offers resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars like amnesty squares avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (wind letters, echoing chords); poetic rhythm modulates effectively to peak without head-hopping. Voice biased toward luminous observation sustains lyric mode legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy repetition ("luminous disbelief" x3, "pixelated amnesty" x4, "scaffold wrap flutters" x3) creates paraphrase loops and synonym churn, dulling summit climax density; figurative overload ("sky split open, spilling amber") in peak beats obscures propulsion (-0.7 overwrite). Template cadence in poetic runs triggers -0.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler myth, pixel amnesty, and collodion glass transforms tropes into inevitable ridge revelation; risk-taking in scaffold-map guidance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
