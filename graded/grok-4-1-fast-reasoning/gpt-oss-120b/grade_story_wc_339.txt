<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mort's quietly analytic trait roots motivation consistently, with micro-choices like untangling showing embodied tension. However, interiority drifts to abstract epiphanies ("tension minus attachment equals the luminous path") that feel unearned rather than contradictory impulses acting in the climax transmission beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (wires, globe, transmission) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in shattering globe and dissolving note, with legible conceptual cost of surrender reweighting the premise. Orientation anchors early in sunken library; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow globe and console as micro-settings constrain choices (retrieval, turning, clutching) and charge final shattering image. Sensory details (stale water bubbles, crackling whisper, algae windows) filter through Mort's analytic gaze, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe last transmission to grasp letting go) signaled early; textural escalation via untangling density and transmission release narrows to renunciation, with felt cost in heart-globe rhythm and past knots loosening. One tightening suffices, agency clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-transformation emerges organically from untangling/transmission/globe particulars, resonant CR in final shards-to-stars image reweighting without moral. Minor slip: near-direct equation articulates thesis, slightly overt in close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (analytic pattern-noting amid melancholy); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet exploration to charged release. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops on "untangling" and "physics of letting go" (e.g., repeated filament-hope-wire motifs across transmission beat) create mild redundancy; figurative density in climax risks overwrite without muddle. Propulsion strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library quest, globe-as-microcosm, and letting-go physics transforms Earhart hook into poignant CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
