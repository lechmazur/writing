<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "bravely conflicted" and "simple yet daring" dominate without embodied contradiction or micro-choices in the slip moment; interiority stays metaphorical-summary rather than particular under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from letter ignition to spreading ripples; Charged Poise closure lands via green shoots reconfiguring frozen stasis with scandal cost legible in "risked her own frozen preservation," though linkages feel declarative over earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (humming shelves, pulsing column, frost on glass) filters through Maren's priorities and subtly constrains via conduit access; final melting snow with green shoots charges closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of provoking dissent tightens texturally through ripple-to-chorus escalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing complacency options; agency in letter slip forces trade-off with legible personal preservation cost, cohering to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of single act thawing silence emerges organically from spreading images (ink bleeding, frost spreading, green shoots) without statement; resonant non-literal answer in final shoots reweights frozen premise with scandal's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable on Maren with perceptual bias toward cold/light motifs; rhythmic texture modulates intensity effectively, though minor zoom-outs (councilor tremor) blur distance slightly without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("dizzying quiet"/"quiet grew louder"/"frozen silence," snow/ice/frost metaphors in most sentences) create template cadence and paraphrase churn, dulling propulsion throughout; overwriting obscures cause/effect in spread beats and touches closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic library as dormant network thawing via contraband letter transforms trope rebellion into poetic inevitability; risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
