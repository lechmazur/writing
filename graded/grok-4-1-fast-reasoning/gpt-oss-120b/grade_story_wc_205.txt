<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation from defunct rebellion compels shard-as-renaissance plan with credible endurance into renewal. Interiority concrete in poetic bias, but contradictory triumph/regret stays abstract without impulses acting in recital beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure at "slipped a tiny piece... ignite another dawn," reconfiguring rebellion with legible sorrow cost. One deepening via refracted tapestry softens dispute; orientation anchored early in asteroid/Lira/shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's mirrors constrain covering/timing method and charge fresco/altar images. Sensory details (silver rain, luminous veil) purposeful, POV-filtered via Lira's poetic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dispute to renaissance) signaled early; textural cadence shift in light projections forces collaborative crystallization. Minimal on-page faction pressure softens agency test in pivotal gathering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art-revolution emerges implicitly via shard/myth-weaving; final vow/shard-as-compass offers resonant reconfiguration of loss/creation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature consistent in nebula/aurora bias; stable limited POV with purposeful elevation. Intensity modulates in storm beat, but diction edges opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms climax ("cascade of silver rain... burnished sorrow" thrice), dulling propulsion per overwrite check. Paraphrase loops in mirror/light motifs obscure cause-effect crispness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shard-light myth-frescoes ingeniously transform revolutionary trope into textural sci-fi lyricism; risk-taking in storm-timing cadence heightens stakes organically.</comment>
