<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arin's luminous skeptic nature drives clear motivation and micro-choices like spreading amber, with embodied emotion in "defiant heart"; internal conflict emerges in questioning awe vs. belonging. Final realization of homecoming as pattern feels earned via prior actions. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphanies slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from amber glow to tower vibration matching alien pulse; single continuous scene anchors orientation early. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "journey toward understanding...stretched onward like the endless rain," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of perpetual inquiry. One tightening via convergence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rain prisms, wet stone scent, ivy-entwined ribs) filter through Arin's chemical lens and constrain choices like spreading amber on marble. Tower core vibration evolves with events, charging final image of shining tower. Micro-setting (courtyard slab) guides pilgrimage path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemistry of homecoming vs. blind awe) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as amber resonates with alien rhythm, narrowing to reciprocal experiment. Agency in whispering token to tower forecloses worship path with felt belonging cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity forging homecoming emerges organically from particulars like amber's glow bridging signals; final image of dim ember and footprints offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting inquiry over awe. Avoids moralizing, embraces endless journey ambiguity. Strong subtext in scholars' observation vs. Arin's defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (chemical bonds, light prisms); rhythmic prose modulates from defiant curiosity to charged poise, consistent lyric texture taught early. No head-hopping or withholding; voice reflects Arin's rebellious lens without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but patterned repetition ("bronze quiet," rain motifs) borders on loop in peak convergence beat, slightly dulling propulsion. Varied syntax supports atmosphere; no major artifacts obscure closure image of fading tower. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "chemical fingerprint of distant worlds."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh lyric sci-fi synthesis transforms first contact via amber chemistry and pilgrimage path, with bold accumulative risk heightening resonance. Final reconfiguration of home as pattern feels inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes. Risk-taking in tone sustains coherence.</comment>
