<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in patience drives micro-choices like placing the fork and imagining steps, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; mythic archetype feels particular yet internal conflict is surface-level, with no visible flaws complicating the vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagined rhythm accumulates into tangible revival; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with tuner's departure and town as "living promise," cost felt in "dust on a drum, quiet yet undeniable"; orientation anchors early in plaza/archway/sunrise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "scent of pine and iron" and archway's "gold" to "silver lattice" integrate into action, mirroring internal rhythm; ancient archway signals consent and charges final market stalls image, constraining the precise sunrise moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revival signaled early tightens accumulatively from solo hum to communal footsteps/workers; agency in tuner's imagined rhythm forces trade-off of solitary patience for shared harmony, with cost legible in steady heart's "unseen foundation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared balance emerges organically from rhythm guiding stone/spirit reunion, reweighted in final well's ripple and children's laughter without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in town's breath as pact fulfilled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in resonant hums/rhythms biases noticing toward auditory/tactile pulses; stable third-limited POV with rhythmic syntax modulating from hush to pulse; no dialogue, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene but minor paraphrase loops in "rhythm"/"hum"/"footsteps" across rebuild beats dull density slightly; figurative language like "shadows into a lattice of silver" coherent yet pervasive in peak revival without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic tuner reviving ghost town via imagined cobblestone rhythm transforms revival trope; risk in abstract "invisible hands" heightens through textural accumulation to inevitable closure without gimmickry.</comment>
