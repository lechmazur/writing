<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in eccentric persistence shines in decision to investigate and align flower with tide lull; interiority concrete via trembling fingers and whispering to wind. Final endurance reconfigures isolation with felt cost in devotion. Minor flaw: epiphany at "understood the final gesture" borders unearned, lacking sharper contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observational density builds to CR closure in placing flower and lighting lamp, reweighting isolation with conceptual cost legible in "heart lighter." Orientation anchored early in dock, twilight, keeper. One tightening via gaps matching petals suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain method, reflecting isolation and charging final image of imprint; tide gaps evolve causally with observation. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt spray, sighs). Recurrent dock mirrors internal state purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early, escalates via pattern-deepening in tide pauses matching petals, forcing realization under Accumulative lens. Agency in watching and placing flower forecloses void with cost in "quiet devotion." Legible price in transformed loneliness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Borrowed memories theme emerges organically from gaps and flower, resonant non-literal answer in dawn imprint reweighting isolation. Complexity in persistent hope vs. void lingers without moralizing. Final image offers counter-reading without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing of tides/flower; rhythmic prose modulates poetically under pressure. No dialogue. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, but heavy figurative density ("bruised lavender," persistent motifs) in most sentences risks overwriting without stronger pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops on "pauses," "sighs," "softly persistent" dull propulsion slightly. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of tide-reading via flower gaps transforms isolation trope; fresh premise of encoded memories feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric method heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
