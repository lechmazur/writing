<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Priest remains mythic archetype without contradictory impulses or embodied flaws complicating climax choices; resolute ritual lacks micro-turns revealing values under soul-threat pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via resonant buildup to CR (stillness shattered then renewed); cost legible in "fragile equilibrium" rupture and "soul might be consumed" before "possession waned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cathedral arches/walls and anchor constrain ritual pulls; indigo pulses and spills charge final bathing light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Textural density deepens dominant stake (avert possession) through loop/whisper/plunge; agency-driven escalation narrows to soul-cost threat crystallized on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final indigo flare and humming hymn reconfigure singular focus's power over unseen without literal moral; emerges from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close POV with perceptual signature of echoes/indigo/similes; rhythmic modulation intensifies ritual pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Purposeful simile/riddle density taught early pays off in illumination without muddle; minor motif repeats like "unraveling stillness" propel texturally without loop drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Loop pedal ritual and single-indigo metaphysics synthesize fresh surreal vision; risk-taking in tonal prayer elevates interdimensional stakes organically.</comment>
