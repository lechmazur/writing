<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel dreams rooted in disenchantment intensifies via embodied pulse matching grotto doubts; earned change at orb touch with crown lifting as cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; retinue shadowy without pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of images builds via basin map to orb CR, reconfiguring dreams as map with legible cost in disenchantment's tempering; orientation anchored early in balcony/ascend.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto pulse constrains deeper climb, basin/crystal reveal tactics, orb charges final empty image; sensory (iron air, mist) selective via queenly priorities, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream mystery) signaled early, one tightening at visions deepening knowledge to map realization under accumulative lens; agency in orb breath forecloses haunted cycle with felt renewal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Renewal-from-mystery theme emerges organically via starlight/orb particulars shifting from haunt to binding; final image reconfigures disenchantment without moralizing, resonant CR lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (crown weight, pulsing ground) stable in single POV; minimal dialogue ("Follow") natural/subtextual; rhythm modulates intensity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Overwriting via figurative density (metaphors most sentences in visions/orb beat) lacks payoff; exact repeat "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" and "bleeding starlight"/dissolve echoes create loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest trope via pulsing grotto/orb visions reweighting dreams as map; images like ember-veins transform fantasy into textured renewal without template echoes.</comment>
