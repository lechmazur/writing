<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent traits like rational rebellion drive micro-choices such as sifting silt and cog placement, with internal conflict over narratives showing contradictory impulses; final convergence earned via prior buildup. Emotions intellectualized without deep embodiment, leaning abstract over visceral contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sedimentary clues and cog sync build density to CR closure where narratives converge ("competing narratives converge"), reweighting single-truth premise with conceptual cost of chorus acceptance; on-page cost legible in "agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful." One tightening via cog sync sufficient; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae, dripping arches, and silt layers filter through philosopher's priorities, constraining discovery; cog as recurring object charges final image ("cog placed at the page’s edge"). Sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (champion narrative to preserve methods) signaled early, deepens via cog sync narrowing to coexistence; agency in decision to document both, but pressure intellectual rather than visceral, with abstract cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of coexisting narratives emerges organically from cog convergence and cipher documentation, final image ("cog ticks... common pulse") offering resonant non-literal answer without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in philosophical filtering ("each grain tells a fragment of a blueprint"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, stable first-person with no head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but paraphrase loops in final third ("sewer... sanctuary," repeated narrative convergence) dull closure image; figurative language purposeful but overwrites high-reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned-city trope with silt-archaeology philosophy and cog convergence; risk in reflective voice heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
