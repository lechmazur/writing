<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to sustain the community is consistent and compels endurance, but interiority relies on summary ("felt the gentle pressure") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of bell rings and runs building to Charged Poise closure in final image of bell swinging under moonlight, reweighting isolation with cost of ongoing risk; orientation anchored early (Mara under arbor at dawn); one tightening via first-month success declaration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and ridge constrain choices (hollow for donations, vantage for listening) and charge final image ("ridge glowed with promise"); sensory details (wind, glow, quiet) selective via Mara's priorities; recurring bell as micro-setting evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sanctions vs. secret sustenance signaled early, escalates texturally through repeated runs and success tightening hope against patrol risk; agency in Mara's bell-ringing and organization; cost legible in persistent secrecy but lacks deeper option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of solidarity from isolation emerges organically via bell's echo and donations, resonating in final image's non-literal promise ("tone lingered... community would endure") without moralizing; subtext in quiet persistence avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (listening to footsteps, amplified quiet); voice texture distinct in rhythmic metaphors ("low drum," "secret heartbeat"); no dialogue; compression of nights/dawns purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short declarative sentences in dawn scenes, but paraphrase loops on "amplified quiet" and "gently persistent" (e.g., repeated in declarations) create minor churn dulling peak density; figurative language coherent but dense in closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile sanctions with bell-signal lifeline transforms isolation trope via textured anonymity and persistence; final reconfiguration of quiet into endurance feels earned from particulars, avoiding generic survival arc.</comment>
