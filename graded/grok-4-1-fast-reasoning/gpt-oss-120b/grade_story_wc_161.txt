<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in loss intensifies through trust-building rituals with pigeons; strength in micro-choices like attaching meteorite slivers; abstract realization ("reinvention does not erase") borders unearned epiphany, softening embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in interweaving trails and pulsing map; closure as Charged Poise/CR in final glowing map with legible cost of memory's "wilt"; orientation anchored early, pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skylight and dust motes constrain mapping choices from outset and charge final image; sensory details (scent of paper, faint hum) filter through Lila's priorities; attic evolves tactilely to "breathe" with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving echoes tightens accumulatively via chip discovery to pigeon attachments narrowing trust options; agency in ritual choices forecloses isolation with felt fragility cost; pressure coheres under lens to charged final chorus ripple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of layered renewal emerges organically from dust trails, meteorite hum, and pigeon bridges; final image reweights premise non-literally via glowing map tinged with wilt; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in coexistence of bloom/wither.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in noticing swirls, glows, and flights; voice rhythm modulates poetically with intensity, compression purposeful and pattern-taught; diction biased toward celestial/fragile textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud with purposeful lyric repetition (balance, trails); high density advances image/atmosphere; minor deduction for dense figuratives ("bloom with withering grace") bordering coherence strain in mid-beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dust mapping, meteorite pigeons, and song echoes transforms loss tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable celestial-personal bridge; inevitable hindsight from early swirls to final glow.</comment>
