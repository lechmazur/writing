<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent seed-saver motivation drives cap placement and seed planting as earned endurance, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the pivotal vortex deepening; "furiously tranquil" embodies mildly without deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to CR closure in "perceived time not as a line but as a texture," legible cost in surrendering cap and mist's "cool imprint"; single scene anchors orientation immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains via melting walls into "shimmering mist that sang," recurring basin/cap charges final planting; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (perfume inhaled, heart rhythm), integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen vortex) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through spiral coiling to phoenix lift-off; agency in lowering hands forecloses path with felt cost in time shards settling on wings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated time emerges from particulars like acorn cap merging frost/flame; resonant CR in final texture perception reweights premise organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with textural perceptual signature ("seconds stretched like dried vines"); rhythmic modulation supports serenity, no head-hopping; capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting dominates climax with figurative density in most sentences ("spiral burst outward, scattering shards of time like crystal snowflakes"); mixed metaphors (gears, aurora, fibrous time) and repetitive "shimmering"/serenity phrasing dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed lineage with phoenix/time vortex transforms tropes through textural imagery; risk in lyric accumulative mode heightens closure resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
