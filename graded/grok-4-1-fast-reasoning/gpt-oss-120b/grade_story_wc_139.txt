<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via vibrations in feet and liquefied doubts; micro-choice of whispering formula reveals values under grief pressure. Minor abstraction in "living calculus of moral exchange" dilutes particularity at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as grief fog density triggers ink glow and shimmering contract CR; cost legible in "liquefying her own rigid doubts." Orientation anchored early in prep room with Mara.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink pot and grief fog constrain ritual, charging final clink image; sensory hierarchy (lilies, sighs as tremors) reflects perceptual shift without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant asylum-proof stake deepens via fog-thickened ink activation under accumulative lens; agency in active waiting forecloses doubt with embodied cost at "seep into her marrow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shimmering contract reweights con legacy into equitable promise, answering fairness theme non-literally; emerges organically from ink alchemy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (ink as "midnight river," curtains fluttering) biases toward alchemical; rhythmic control modulates intensity consistently in single stable POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via integrated images like "veins of gold"; alchemical metaphors cohere across peak without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink pot's fair-trade alchemy in deathly prep room transforms con trope boldly; surreal contract dissolution feels inevitable from established ritual.</comment>
