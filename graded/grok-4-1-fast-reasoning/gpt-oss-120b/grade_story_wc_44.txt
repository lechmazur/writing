<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in childhood riddle drives consistent traits and actions, earning the final cataloguing joy; quietly deliberate nature shown through pausing breaths and night-after-night tracing. Lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with interiority leaning toward summary over scene-specific tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rune-tracing density builds to chime and doorway flicker, tightening to CR closure when "She pressed the clockwork key into the stone arch" reconfigures sealed awakenings with settling cost. Orientation anchored early in observatory; one continuous scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring key and telescope constrain choices, charging final chamber pulse; sensory details like "scent of old parchment and faint vibration of gears" filter through Lira's priorities, evolving with events. Micro-setting of floor glyphs guides spiral action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock shadows' path escalates via glyph alignment to doorway widening under accumulative lens, narrowing options with her incantation agency; cost felt in key's wind-down and island settling after pressing into arch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of loops bridging observation to revelation emerges organically from tracing to final map illumination, offering resonant non-literal answer in "journey had closed a loop that spanned reality" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic, gear-echoing syntax modulates deliberately under building pressure; purposeful compression of ritual actions taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops around "closing loops" and "quietly deliberate" slightly dull mid-beats without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spoons-bending-reality hook transforms shadow-migration premise into fresh rune-loop synthesis, with final chamber map feeling inevitable; risk-taking in absurd backstory heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
