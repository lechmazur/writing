<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate estrangement drives concrete micro-choices like whispering stories and recording Lena's fragments, earning her final realization; embodied emotions in tunnel's "softer" breath and concrete pulse. Internal conflict between isolation and emerging kinship acts simultaneously without tidy resolution. Minor abstract phrasing like "teaching endings how to begin" borders therapy-speak but anchors in disc actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density via layered calls on the disc, tightening to CR closure where "cultivated estrangement dissolved"; cost legible in Mara's step out and etched promise. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (tunnel, booth, disc). Pattern taught early, holds to final pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent disc catches "flickers like fireflies trapped in glass," constraining Mara's practice and charging final image; sensory hierarchy (drips, hum, neon) reflects isolation sharpened by tunnel. Details evolve causally with infused sorrow, mirroring internal cadence shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of estrangement vs. connections escalates accumulatively through voice layers forming "chorus," narrowing options to dissolution; agency in listening/recording forces trade-off. Cost unmistakable in "concrete pulse" and foreclosed isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loops transforming endings emerges implicitly from disc's "endless cycle infused with Lena’s sorrow" to final reconfiguration; resonant image of etched promise reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in haunted, rhythmic diction ("melodically haunted," echoing walls); voice modulates from watchful isolation to quiet communion. Mara's question to Lena carries natural subtext, advancing pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "loop" recurrence under textural lens; rhythm varies (short echo lines to flowing arpeggios), no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of "subterranean heartbeat."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass harmonica disc in wrong-number symphony transforms isolation trope into fresh, inevitable CR; risk of lyric accumulative design heightens stakes via irreplaceable haunted mechanics.</comment>
