<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "cold ache softening into luminescent ache," with micro-choices like precise stone stacking revealing values; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal ritual, keeping it from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via ritual to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in sea glass warming as talisman amid "luminescent ache of memory," reconfiguring haunted room; orientation anchored immediately in arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "wind moaned through broken panes" filter through observant POV and constrain ritual on stone slab; recurring stones/glass charge final pulse image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bottle/protect safety tightens texturally as lamp dies and spiral pulses, narrowing to endurance with felt emotional cost; agency in stacking forecloses isolation via shared chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of bottling/shared safety emerges organically from stone ritual and glass reprise, resonant in final glow from "collective memory"; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in poetic observations like "each sigh of wind against iron ribs"; rhythmic diction modulates effectively for meditative pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on "glow" and "ache" (e.g., repeated "glowed faintly") dull density in ritual build; overwriting with stacked metaphors like "trapped sunrise" borders muddle but supports voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse ritual transforming "haunted" to sanctuary via imagined stone letters; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in pulse/glow without gimmickry.</comment>
