<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in listening to gaps, actions align with traits; strength in micro-choices like whispering to flame. Weakness: minimal contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously, competence lacks embodied friction at peak stitching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as embroidery density builds patterns to CR closure; cost legible in "ember, now a memory, faded into ash, leaving only the stitched sky." One tightening via flame's specific revelations suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting anchors early, cobalt walls and autumn leaves constrain via signals/whispers that shape tactics; charges final image as "copper dome" dawn brushes, reconfiguring silence to hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel conspiracy) signaled early, escalates via textural density in threads/knots mirroring conspirators' rhythm; agency in synchronizing forecloses inaction with flame's consumption cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth in unheard gaps emerges organically from stitching hypotheses; resonant CR in "city breathed a new, unspun tale" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic patterns/flame pulses; stable close third-person modulates lyric intensity, compression purposeful and taught early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, rhythm varies; minor patterned repetition ("whisper/rustle") purposeful for tone, no loops obscuring closure. Slight overwriting in "sky bruised with dying stars" but voice-integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy tool transforms tropes organically; fresh premise inevitable in hindsight, risk in abstract "adjacent possibilities" heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
