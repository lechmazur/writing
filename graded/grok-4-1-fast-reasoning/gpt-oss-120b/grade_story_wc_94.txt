<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in censorship and scar-mapping drives ritual actions like setting the timer, but interior conflict remains abstractly poetic rather than showing contradictory impulses in micro-choices; embodied emotion leans metaphorical over visceral, with "furiously tranquil" more label than simultaneous tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from timer setup to ringing revelation; clear single-scene structure orients early via stair climb and dome; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "scars... terrain to be traversed" with felt endurance cost, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory vividly sensory (ozone, thunder roar, lightning veins) integrates into action like dome opening and mirrors internal scars; recurring clouds/churn constrain mood and charge final drizzle image, fulfilling 9+ gate without white-room or clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncensoring via vigil signaled early tightens accumulatively through 23-minute countdown narrowing to revelation; agency in whispering poem and timer use forecloses suppression with legible conceptual cost in scar terrain endurance, one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of scars as redeemable cartography emerges organically from timer vigil and storm images, culminating in resonant non-literal closure "terrain to be traversed"; purposeful ambiguity invites reflection without moralizing or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "clouds churned like ink on parchment"); rhythmic modulation under storm pressure, no head-hopping or withholding; voice texture purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "lightning etched silver veins") during peak but no loops, scaffolds, or muddle touching closure; clean grammar and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic ritual with timer/envelope in storm observatory transforms censorship trope into scar cartography; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically, no derivatives or hedging.</comment>
