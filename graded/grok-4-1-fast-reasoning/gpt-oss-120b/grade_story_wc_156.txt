<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority ties restorations to awakenings, with micro-choices like brush taps revealing values under curiosity's pull; final smile/choice earned via layered realizations. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more stated than simultaneous in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of echoes/awakenings tightening to CR closure ("old certainty drift away" reconfigures stance with felt opportunity cost in final image); orientation anchored early, one deepening via heartbeat sync suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden's sound waves constrain choices (whisper, tap) and charge final ripple image; sensory hierarchy (harmonic currents, bells) reflects restorer's perceptual bias, vivid/selective without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, escalates via density increase/brush tap reversal narrowing to Charged Poise; cost legible in drifting certainty, agency in taps/smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (nickel sparks, nested murals) to resonant non-literal answer in final ripple/promise; ambiguity lingers without confusion, arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (brushstrokes in auroras); rhythmic modulation builds pressure, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("nested awakenings," "reflected sound") and figurative density in peak cascade obscure propulsion slightly; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden/hobo nickel transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
