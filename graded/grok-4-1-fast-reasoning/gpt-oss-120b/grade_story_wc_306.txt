<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's sincerely insincere vows drive contradictory impulses like shrugging off weight while tallying winds, earning closure satisfaction; single-POV interiority concrete but magistrate off-page limits relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as chime pattern deciphers doubts leading to knot-unhooking RR with nuance cost legible in magistrate's wavering eyes; orientation anchored early at lighthouse balcony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wind chimes and lantern constrain deciphering/projecting, charging closure shard image; dawn breeze/sea sensory hierarchy mirrors Mara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nuance stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via chimes/mirror narrowing certainty options; unhook agency forecloses rigidity with on-page softening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shard's emptiness as doubt portal reconfigures truth premise non-literally in final sea reflection; theme emerges from chime/cloak particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in cryptic chime/tide noticing; voice rhythm modulates from flicker to lingering tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in echoing/lingering motifs across adjacent lines dull propulsion in mid-beats; figurative density overwrites peaks without full pattern payoff, but syntax varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conscience-for-hire premise transforms doubt into tangible cloak/shard synthesis; lyric risk heightens stakes via chime method without gimmickry.</comment>
