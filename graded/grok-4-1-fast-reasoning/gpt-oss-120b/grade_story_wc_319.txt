<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Guardian's feral-reverent contradiction shines in tentative approach to pendant, earning shift to curator with cost of inviting unknown; embodied longing via homesick echoes and sinew warmth avoids abstracts. Final acceptance forecloses feral isolation, tied to prior micro-choice of interiorizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stalking to pendant absorption to new wing, with Charged Poise closure in "heart beating in time with the garden’s sighs," cost legible in binding to cult purpose and fragile order risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden's petals-as-stories and mist constrain guardianship, charging final image of mist-woven walls; sensory selectivity (rusted syllables, pulsing amber) mirrors internal fog, evolving with dawn unfurl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of befriending uncertainty tightens texturally via pendant's hum forcing reverent wait over aggression; cost felt in "inevitable collapse" awareness, agency in pendant-resting choice narrowing feral purity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges via pendant pact shifting waiting from punishment to promise; final image of dancing boundaries reweights motif without statement, resonant via conflicted clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature fuses library metaphors (pages turning, unfiled stories) with mist rhythm; diction modulates from feral stalking to lucid fog, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor synonym churn on mist/fog and boundaries dulls two peak sentences around absorption; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral librarian in story-petals garden transforms tropes via interiorizing ritual; risk of abstract homesickness pays off in pendant's dimensional pact, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
