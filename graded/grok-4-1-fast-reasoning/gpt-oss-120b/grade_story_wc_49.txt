<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore practices drives consistent micro-choices like playing the lyre and weaving a counter-melody, with embodied resonance ("vibrate within her chest"). Lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating peak decisions, smoothing internal conflict into reverence without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to pollen cascade RR (Charged Poise), with cost in her vowed devotion legible in kneeling and whispering. Orientation anchored early ("edge of the ancient forest...verdant arbor at dawn"). Single continuous scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (dew, pine, glimmering tendril) filters through Mara's reverent bias, with canopy constraining moon's light in climax. Verdant arbor as micro-setting guides ritual choices without stalls. Final rustling bark charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rites via vine/moon) signaled early, tightens texturally as vines wrap and pollen falls, narrowing to her endurance with felt cost of guardianship. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without agency-driven reversal, but density reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of remedy as memory's reenactment emerges organically from lyre-played songs and light-stories, with final vow offering resonant non-literal answer. Particulars like pollen grains as "sealed vow" avoid platitudes; ambiguity in forest's "smile" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature in reverent noticing ("whispering a melody...subtle pulse"). Rhythmic modulation builds to moon's halo without slippage; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High figurative density ("notes rose like sunbeams...golden threads spiraled") borders overwriting in climax beat, dulling propulsion slightly; minor paraphrase loops ("forgotten songs" thrice in close proximity). Rhythm varies read-aloud, but synonym churn ("light" motifs) adds scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-lyre ritual transforming myth into tactile pollen-vow, with moon-vine alignment risking poetic boldness that heightens thematic stakes organically. Transformation test passes: core arc hinges on specific songs-to-stories conceit.</comment>
