<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to discover lost paths clear and consistent, intensifying through assembly and tapping; Mara shows embodied recall of bleaching. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat, with realizations feeling told via "periodically eternal."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of routines, taps, data builds to CR closure in coordinate flash and log entry, reweighting premise with reefs' chemical loss cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early at station/pier; one tightening via watermark echo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station, pier, ocean sensory vivid and selective (humming sensors, tide breaths, steel table), mirroring internal states; canyon/recurring atlas constrains discovery choice and charges final "bridge" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost paths/marine guidance) signaled early, tightens texturally via cadence shift in longer tap resonance and sea rise mirroring predictions, forcing realization with felt reef cost; agency in deliberate tapping/endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of oceanic memory/listening emerges from particulars (taps as conduit, canyon gradients); final log/image offers resonant CR repricing human charts' gaps without moralizing, reweighting premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in oceanic rhythm/drift diction stable third-limited POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("periodically eternal" x3, "drifting moored" x4) and template cadence in poetic sentences dull density; figurative overwriting (e.g., "kelp in a lazy current," "holding its breath") pervades discovery beat without restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tapping as oceanic metronome and atlas watermark transforms eco-tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens restoration stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
