<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's embodied panic unsnarls concretely via vial scent, with motivation intensifying to share ephemeral hush; minor slip in diagnostic "true motivation" realization mid-story lacks deeper contradictory impulses in pivotal temple response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to charged poise closure as vial scent explodes outward, costing distress beacon; coherent shards from dive to shore with legible hush motif tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Underwater temple's kelp pillars and stained glass constrain dives and charge final altar image; sensory selectivity reflects Mara's urgency, with sea calming via hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vial pursuit tightens accumulatively as temple demands beacon sacrifice, forcing renunciation with felt cost; pressure coheres to override-instinct resolve without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral harnessing emerges via hush motifs shifting from personal calm to shared legend; resonant uncorking answers question non-literally but borders overt in final whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual bias toward oceanic memories; rhythmic modulation builds hush texture under stress, no dialogue to judge, diction character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motif repetition (unsnarl x4, hush variants x6) patterns accumulative drive but creates synonym churn dulling peak vial slip; dense figuration in climax ("tide of gathered hush that cradled her like a mother's breath") borders coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh perfume vial conjuring time-slowing sunrise scent transforms underwater trope via unsnarl mechanic; risk in poetic hush glyphs pays off at shared eternity image.</comment>
