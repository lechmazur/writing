<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skeptic's motivation to liberate memories drives patient choices, with embodied curiosity in tracing symbols; final tempering of doubt earned via climax unstick feels authentic but edges into summary epiphany ("luminous skepticism now tempered").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbols accumulate to geese pause enabling unstick; on-page closure via box opening reconfigures past/present with legible cost in "ancient reluctance" uncoiling under patience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fountains and luminescent symbols on stones constrain path through alleys to plaza, charging final ripple image that enables unstick; sensory petrichor/incense selective via Mara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to liberate memories tightens accumulatively via breadcrumb path to geese pause; agency in patient twist forecloses doubt path with felt reluctance cost at "hinges tightening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forging belief from skeptical patience emerges via symbol accumulation, resolved non-literally in lights-to-constellations mirroring geese; no moralizing, resonant via liberated memories seeding stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("eyes glowing faintly with curiosity even as she doubted"); rhythmic modulation builds to defiant hush, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites climax ("cascade of tiny lights... merged into a constellation," "knot unravelling") without obscuring cause/effect (-0.6); minor hush repetition paraphrase but propulsion holds; high density elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic unstick via geese breadcrumbs/symbols/geese transforms myth trope organically; risk in lyric patience payoff heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
