<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to teach dust stories drives consistent micro-choices like transcribing verses, embodied in her calm precision. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal transcription beat; internal calm endures without visible cost or renunciation foreclosing a path. Quiet pride at end feels earned but archetypal without deeper flaws complicating peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from private copying to public chorus via dust patterns, with clear orientation in opening alcove anchor. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final image of dust as storyteller, reweighting famine premise with conceptual cost of bridging silence via diligent conduit role. Inciting pirate crackle motivates ellipsis without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, and dust constrain choices (mist curls tighter prompting cloak; dust absorbs glow for transcription) and charge final swirling image. Sensory hierarchy via Mara's copyist bias (noticing chords in wind, parchment dust) integrates selectively into action. Recurring glow and dust evolve causally, mirroring internal revival without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive stories post-famine) signaled early, escalates texturally via density from solo transcription to crowd-syncing applause under lens. Agency in aligning dial and pressing play narrows private urge to public conduit, with felt cost in holding luminous secret close at end. Climax chord fade tests commitment without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten particles speaking emerges organically from dust motif shifting to humming/storytelling, reweighting premise in final sanctuary image without moralizing. Subtext in phantom verses implies revival's fragile hope amid silence. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; conceptual cost lingers in dust's earned voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: luminous whispers and dust as musical particles bias noticing. Rhythmic prose modulates from calm copying to pulsing glow at play-press climax, with purposeful poetic compression taught early. No dialogue; voice texture coherent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure transcription beat ("pulsed with... glow, as if the ink itself carried a fragment"), with mixed vehicles (fireflies/amber, gulls/seas) and repetitive "thistled calm" (3x) eroding propulsion. Some paraphrase loops in mist/glow descriptions dull momentum. Rhythm varies but template poetic stems limit ear test; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast via dust-storyteller premise synthesizes radio revival and poetic particles freshly, transforming post-famine tropes through Mara's conduit choices. Final dust swirl feels inevitable from early patterns. Bold lyric risk heightens atmospheric stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
