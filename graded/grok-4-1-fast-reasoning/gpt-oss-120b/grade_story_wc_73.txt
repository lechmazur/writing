<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to achieve perpetual motion via dice intensifies credibly to honoring flaw's persistence, rooted in grim optimism shown in "smile hinted at hope even as darkness whispered." Contradictory impulses act in building contraption despite chipped die's refusal; minor abstract phrasing in epiphanies slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from rolls to contraption quiver; closure as CR in "chipped side faced up at last, a faint scar turned triumph" reconfigures flaw as stabilizer with conceptual cost of accepting imperfection. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via staircase response suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains via shifting steps per rolls, charging final image of "each step now a calculated echo"; "bronze frame on the eighth landing" grounds specificity. Sensory details like "marble arches" integrate purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of perpetual motion tightens accumulatively through contraption programming and flaw incorporation, narrowing options with agency; cost legible in "permanent flaw... paradoxically stabilized." Escalation driven by Aric's adjustments under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection propelling motion emerges organically from chipped die's arc, resonating in final "scar turned triumph" that reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity embraced in flaw's dual role as cage and key.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature biased toward math/poetic lattice; diction rhythmic and character-specific in noticing "glyph a whisper of kinetic potential." Elevated register consistent but occasionally over-ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure build-up ("quiet rupture... sigh of relief" stacked amid quiver), dulling propulsion per overwriting check; paraphrase loops on "missed opportunity" and "stubbornness" (four iterations) create redundancy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chipped dice, math proofs, and infinite staircase transforms perpetual motion trope into textural quest; "chipped side as constant offset" inflects organically. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
