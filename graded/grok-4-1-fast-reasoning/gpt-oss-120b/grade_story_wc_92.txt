<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: motive to spark revolution aligns with inventive actions like tracing sundial angles, compelling higher-stakes slipping through corridors. Weakness: lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion in pivotal cradle activation, defaulting to poetic abstraction over concrete interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as clue density (sundial decoding, coded marks) builds to RR closure at quill placement in cradle, reconfiguring garrison with legible cost in rewritten logbooks and secret smiles. Orientation anchored early via Kael at fort portal; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sundial as recurring micro-setting constrains decoding choices early and charges amber-line path to basement climax. Sensory details (phosphorescent pulse, flickering lamps) vivid and POV-biased toward intrigue, mirroring internal spark without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silent revolution escalates accumulatively via blackout slipping to sunrise activation, narrowing options with one tightening (sundial glow reveals path). Agency in quill placement forecloses violent path with felt cost of watchful hiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of light-without-flame revolution emerges organically from spark motifs shifting to "whispered rhythm," offering resonant non-literal answer in final garrison smiles without moralizing. Complexity lingers in quiet thunder's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in luminous/poetic noticing (shadows as clues, walls listening) stable in single limited-POV; rhythmic texture modulates hush to cascade urgency. Ornate diction risks overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites most sentences even in activation climax (cascade, flutter, moss), triggering −0.7; minor paraphrase loops in "winking hush"/quiet repetitions dull propulsion without pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but scaffold hedges momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of idea-ignition premise via sundial code transforms quiet-rebellion trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with cradle payoff feeling inevitable from early particulars.</comment>
