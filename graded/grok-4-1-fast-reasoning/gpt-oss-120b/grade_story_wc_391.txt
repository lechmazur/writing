<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to sculpt patience clear and intensifies through embodied observation; strength in contradictory impulses like "restless yearning" cooled to "steady ember." Weakness: diagnostic labels like "patient revolution" in peak realization reduce interior contradiction to articulated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of moon paths and pulses building to CR closure ("unyoke of her own restless yearning" as legible cost in final tether release). Orientation anchored early ("basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake"); single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (viaduct, ice, basalt) constrains choices like compass placement and charges final image (pillars as "patient sentinels"); sensory details selective and POV-biased (magnetic hum through gloves). Vivid integration mirrors internal rhythm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode viaduct for patience) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via pattern intensification to moon-apex surge narrows to realization trade-off. Cost felt in "ice itself had released a quiet tether"; agency in tracking/placement coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of patience emerges organically from particulars (moon arcs, hums) to resonant CR ("gently untying of knots"); final mantra/image reweights without moralizing. Minor slip: "patient revolution" borders on overt statement mid-story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (magnetic pulses as "tide of distant sea"); rhythmic modulation heightens lyric pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overload in peak beat ("ice seemed to breathe... echo of intention") triggers −0.5 overwriting; minor paraphrase loops ("patient" recurrences). Rhythm varies, no template cadence; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horizon mapper and glowing viaduct transforms patience trope into textured ritual; risk in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious CR feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
