<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to foster peace roots in consistent rebellious-yet-respectful traits, shown in his "gait" and bottle-whisper; interiority concrete via embodied storm pulses syncing with heart. Final endurance of fragile truce earned by risk, foreclosing detection path with felt cost. Minor slip: epiphanic summary in ending reflection slightly abstracts prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm/neon patterns builds to Charged Poise closure in drones' crossing paths and empty bottle image, reweighting voids with conceptual peace cost. Orientation anchors early ("Cobalt arcade... Milo, the disputed territory mailman"). Single scene causality tight; bottle eruption decisively narrows drone threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (neon hum, rotor whine, rain seeping tiles) filtered through Milo's priorities, constraining choices like console placement. Recurring cobalt light and arcade machines charge final dimming/flicker image, mirroring internal hush. Micro-setting (bottle as tool/object) evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truce delivery past drone) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bottle flash tightening options, forcing envelope slip with visible risk cost. Agency in whispered promise and setting bottle drives resolution; second drone crystallizes stance. Minor: cost mostly conceptual, less visceral than peak eruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises via voids emerges organically from envelope vow and rain-washed grudges, resonating in final "storm confined can still rain hope" image without moralizing. Subtext in absences links events; CR reweights premise with fragile bridge cost. No tidy binary, ambiguity lingers in "dared to listen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in storm/neon idiom ("electric sigh," "pulsed in rhythm with his heart"); rhythm modulates from tense whine to quiet rain cadence under pressure. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and strong verbs ("slicing," "erupted"); figurative storm motif purposeful, not muddled in peak drone beat. Minor artifacts: paraphrase echoes ("brittle hush," "quiet") in reflective close dull closure image slightly (−0.4); no loops obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman/smuggling arcade with storm bottle transforms tropes via poetic voids-peace logic; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration ("paths crossing... silent vow") inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
