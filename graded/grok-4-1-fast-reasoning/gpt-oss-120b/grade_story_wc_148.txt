<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to chase hush for redemption roots consistently in lattice and past alarms, compelling micro-choices like stepping onto ledge; embodied via pulsing lattice and searing feet. Internal conflict emerges in haunted name versus guiding purpose, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal chest-lifting beat. Earned stasis in final whisper forecloses false-alarm path with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via building images (lattice glow, hush sighs); density cadence shifts to Charged Poise closure in final balcony image where legend reconfigures as beacon, cost legible in sustained impossibilities versus past echoes. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (lighthouse prison, cry wolf boy, one night). Continuous scene with legible movement fits defaults; no causality breaks despite surrealism taught via lattice pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (salty wind, damp tiles, cold salt searing feet) filters through boy's mythic bias, constraining choices like slick rocks and ajar door. Recurring copperlight beam and lattice as micro-settings mirror internal hush, charging final silhouette image. Atmosphere tensions repose against reef urgency without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via hush before bodies found) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through lattice pulse to map unfolding and reef confrontation, narrowing options to whisper tale. Agency in following path and lifting chest forces endurance with searing-feet cost; bodies rising reweights knowledge under textural lens. One decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of warnings as threads emerges organically from lattice/map and final whisper, resisting tidy moral via mother's oblique voice; subtext in bodies' grateful silence offers resonant CR to cry-wolf premise. Final image reconfigures past alarms into guiding light without statement, lingering ambiguity in future callers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light-bending, hush-chasing diction; rhythmic modulation builds to stressed compression in reef beat. Purposeful poetic elision taught early holds legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping. Voice texture distinct and biased toward mythic whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" verbatim repeat; "copperlight repose" x4, "lattice" churn) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion, obscuring cause/effect in path-following beats. Overwriting with figuration in every high-pressure sentence (chest/map) triggers coherence muddle; artifacts touch closure image. Density low despite vivid patches; rhythm varies but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms cry-wolf trope via lattice-sustained surrealism and hush-map into redemptive labyrinth, risking mythic tone that heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious final reconfiguration (bodies rise in silence) feels inevitable from established pattern, no derivative echoes.</comment>
