<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation clear and consistent in clutching watch and documenting, with embodied caution; veiled dreamer applies relational pressure via actions like lifting latch but lacks voice distinction or internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reversal patterns and delays build density to charged poise closure in garden image with perseverance cost; orientation anchored early in library entry; one tightening via crystal resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, glyphs, and crystal constrain path choices and charge final garden image; sensory details (glows, whispers, scent) vivid and POV-filtered through quest urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find unspoken library signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern decoding that narrows options; agency in noting delays anticipates reversals with implied perseverance cost legible at crystal payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken stories gaining voice emerges organically from glyph rearrangements to petal promises; final garden image resonantly reweights quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with mystical perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates intensity; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of "propagation delays" and "cyclically reversed" teaches motif but creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in middle beats; high figurative density coherent yet borders overwriting in discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cipher watch and reversal glyphs transforms library quest trope; petal laughter and chime risks bold closure reconfiguration.</question>
