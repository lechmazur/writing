<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between doubts and purpose acts in unstrapping and mist walking; final ignition earned by prior micro-choices with reputation cost legible at palm-on-stone climax. Embodied emotions via heartbeat sync and spire's breath; no diagnostic labels flatten peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of luminance imagery tightens to CR closure at "underachieving reputation dissolved," reweighting premise with felt humility cost in final pulse. Orientation anchored early at spire base; one deepening via mist-to-platform suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ledge and mist constrain mist walk choice on narrow path; frost veil and fog evolution mirror internal thaw, charging final firefly image. Sensory hierarchy mage-specific (chimes, glow pulses); no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet purpose vs. doubts) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through luminance infusion narrowing to touch; agency in steps forecloses doubt path with dissolution cost at climax. Coherent pressure reweights via pattern break at platform solidification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of simple sacred emerges implicitly from unstrapping to firefly scatter; final CR image non-literally answers mechanized vs. quiet brilliance without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like keystone pulse recharges prior contrasts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with mage-biased perceptual signature (luminous fog, chimes); rhythmic texture modulates but some repetition dulls under ascent pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting via figurative density in every mist walk sentence ("luminous fog... brilliant dimness... quiet sigh") lacks pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion; "lingering luminance" loops (5+ repeats) with synonym churn dull closure image. Paraphrase redundancy in glow descriptions; rhythm varies but template stems recur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underachiever mage vs. automated creativity transforms trope via luminance/keystone logic; mist walk and firefly coda feel inevitable from quiet stakes. Bold lyric risk heightens thematic charge without gimmick.</comment>
