<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Child's motivation rooted in lineage and loss compels intuitive actions, with embodied resolve in palm-pressing and step-measuring; internal conflict subtle but present in sensing echoes versus forward movement. Featherly determination shows through persistent micro-choices under uncertainty. Minor slip in abstract epiphany at "true distance one must travel," but earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from code to grain to maps, culminating in CR closure where child's realization reweights search premise with cost of shed loss. Orientation anchored early (child on terrace post-wind). Single-shard scene with seamless corridor transition; one tightening at panel reveal narrows to path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and glass corridor constrain choices (palm on copper, foot on seam, hand on map); grain in chairs and shifting-ink maps evolve via temperature/action. Sensory hierarchy (hum/vibrations to corn scent) filters through child's intuitive bias. Micro-setting of chairs/wooden rings charges path-mapping pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher code to exit maze) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via grain analysis to corridor discovery, forcing endurance with felt cost in "shedding the weight of loss." Agency in intuitive presses and measured steps; moral calculus emerges in sacred thresholds. Coherent pressure reconfigures stance at realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds/distances emerges organically from particulars (chair grains, map ridges, collapsing distance into memory), reweighted in final CR image without moralizing. Subtext in silent gaps/whispers invites ambiguity on loss versus guardianship. Protagonist arc inextricable from emerging wisdom on wonder/understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as pulses, grain whispers); poetic diction/rhythm modulates from hushed analysis to pulsing approval, heightening intuitive texture. No head-hopping; voice reflects child's featherly poise under subtle stress. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short prayers amid dense imagery); high density in multi-job lines like "each step a prayer to the unseen architects of wind." Purposeful repetition ("necessary distances," "fractured hush") teaches pattern without loop excess. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors at climax deducts, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze trope via drifting prism, grain-maps, and butterfly-rearranged stalks transforms loss into guardianship. Bold lyric risk in intuition-driven turns heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable terrace/code geometry feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
