<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through goal-directed actions like tracing ice fissures, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied flaws acting in scene; competent archetype without genuine struggle softens the score. Final vigil promise shows credible endurance with felt cost of ongoing guard duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ice examination causally links to tunnel reveal and stone placement, culminating in RR closure (bloom of hush) with vigil cost legible in "whispered a promise to the silence." Anchors who/where/when by paragraph 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice crack patterns constrain key choice (tracing guides to tunnel) and charge final image (smooth edges softened by stone); sensory details like pulsing silver lines and dripping silence integrate purposefully through POV bias toward resonances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet amid storm) signaled early; accumulative escalation via density of vibrations to hush tightens pressure, narrowing to placement with visible cost of perpetual vigil in closing lines. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance between echo/silence emerges organically from stone's effect on energy beings and realization "quiet... not the absence of sound, but the balance"; final image reweights prior storm without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature attuned to pulses/resonances; rhythmic prose modulates from reverberating tones to steady lull, maintaining diction control under peak placement moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition of "gently luminous"/"bloom of hush" builds texture without loops obscuring cause/effect; high density in ice-tracing beat propels, but minor synonym churn ("quiet," "hush," "silence") dulls propulsion slightly. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resonant fantasy elements like ripple-mark skin mapping vibrations transforms tropes; final reconfiguration (storm to repose) feels inevitable from cave logic, with risk in poetic compression heightening ingenuity.</comment>
