<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in fractured inspiration compel the pivotal painting choice; micro-choices like concealing the mirror reveal values under pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the climax scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via memories and light patterns culminating in Charged Poise RR at lock opening and ink vial emergence; cost legible in "heart untangle" and lingering reminder. Orientation anchored early in cavern/expedition; one tightening via portrait revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal walls and light constrain mirror tactic and charge final aurora image; sensory details (glittering walls, humming shards) filter through Lena's artistic bias and evolve with action. Micro-setting (charcoal fingers, canvas) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity) signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening memories to agency-driven painting reversal; cost felt in prior suppression resolved but with "callings never truly end." One meaningful cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable callings emerges organically from painting struggle and ink flood; final image reweights suppression into "river of possibility" without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on endless reminders.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct artistic perceptual signature (shadows as oaths, strokes as veins) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable close third-person POV, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative language (e.g., "light braided with sorrow") overwrites peak painting beat without full pattern payoff, mixing metaphors and repeating "auroral sorrow" motif excessively; propulsion suffers minor loop friction but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic artistry unlocking literal creativity in crystal metaphor transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract tone heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
