<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks concrete interior contradiction or embodied emotion; motivation clear but abstract, with no micro-choices under pressure revealing flaws or hierarchy of values, as in the ritual actions without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise RR ("last burden dissolve... pure echo of intention") reconfiguring trapped sorrow into fluid memory; cost legible in patience and stillness requirement; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and lamp constrain choices (align to moon's edge for alchemy) and charge final image (walls painted with sunrise, crystal veil reflecting whales); selective sensory detail mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind grotto's sorrow) signaled early with textural tightening via process intensification to final alignment thrum; one meaningful cadence shift narrows to stillness cost, charging closure without agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of burdens transmuted to art emerges organically from particulars like pulsing spheres to shining feather; final image ("burdens... constellations") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractal-patterned noticing and rhythmic lyricism; stable single POV with purposeful compression; voice modulates from reverie to release without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overwriting via repetitive motifs ("shingled hush" 5x, "whalebone reverie" 3x) creates paraphrase loops dulling high-pressure ritual beats; figurative density lacks pattern payoff in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal weaving, mineral alchemy, and burden spheres into leviathan-tinged reverie transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in sustained lyric pattern heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
