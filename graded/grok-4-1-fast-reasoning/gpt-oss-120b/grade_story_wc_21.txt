<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to chase suppressed histories intensifies credibly through micro-choices like arranging debris and descending, earning her final resolve. Interiority concrete in "heart burned with a searing reverie," embodied via notebook clutch and eyes burning brighter. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in negotiating with nomads under desert's demands; final broadcast renunciation of silence shows earned change with cost of effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letters summon → parley → debris arrangements unlock shaft → descent reveals crystal → broadcast cracks silence. Orientation anchored early (zeppelin deck, desert, archivist summoned). Closure as Decisive Change in broadcast ripple "across the desert like a call to conscience," with felt cost of prior labors; one tightening at dune hum suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (brass hum, violet reflections, dune chorus) filter through Mara's priorities, constraining choices like debris spirals and lamp descent. Setting evolves causally (zeppelin to shaft to lagoon), mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Final brass panels glowing violet charges closure image, indispensable micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover suppressed testimonies) signaled early, tightens via parley reversal narrowing access, agency in debris encoding and crystal translation. Escalation causal under lens, costs visible (nights arranging, descent risk). Climax broadcast forecloses suppression with desert's tremble as undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed memory emerges organically from diary trap undone to broadcast echo, subtext in glyphs rippling and dune hum as suppressed voices. Final image reconfigures premise (truth from depths) with conceptual cost of erased histories restored, no moralizing. Resonance from particulars like oilskin resisting light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in reverie-tinged noticing (e.g., "dark as midnight oil"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythm for intensity, diction purposeful (e.g., "fractal patterns"). No dialogue, but internal texture distinct and pressure-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm supports propulsion; sensory images advance atmosphere without padding. Minor overwrite in repeated "searing reverie" (3x) borders motif but risks loop in mid-beats; no closure touch. Clean syntax, strong verbs propel to "desert's silence cracked."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: zeppelin library, sand-carvers reading debris fractals, retrocognitive trap transform tropes into causal engine. Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes via temporal snare payoff at crystal decode. Inevitable hindsight from lagoon's glyphs to broadcast reconfiguration.</comment>
