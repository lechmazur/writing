<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Intern's motivation rooted in engineering traits drives revival choices consistently, with stoic wonder embodied in final smile and warm sextant; minor abstract interiority ("maze of intentions") lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal calculation beat, but actions align without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from exploration to schematic discovery tightening to equation revival; Charged Poise closure in moon alignment and beacon with conceptual cost of transformed joy legible; orientation anchored immediately in first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sextant and conduits as micro-settings constrain alignment choices and charge final vibration image; sensory details (hum, whir, dust) filtered through engineer's flow perceptions evolve with revival; no generic placeholders, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting hope signaled early escalates accumulatively via schematic deepening that narrows to new equations; agency in rerouting shows trade-off in ethical currents; cost felt in foreclosed forgotten promises.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reordered intentions emerges organically from flows and schematics, resonating in spiral image reweighting carnival loss without moralizing; final beacon answers hope equation non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with engineering perceptual signature (vectors, currents) modulates rhythm in revival surge; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged ending poise; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("maze of intentions," "redirected flows") repeat across three beats dulling propulsion slightly; no closure artifacts, metaphors consistent if elevated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant in sci-fi engineering transforms relic trope into ethical compass; risk in abstract "intentions" lattice pays off in spiral reconfiguration, feeling inevitable.</comment>
