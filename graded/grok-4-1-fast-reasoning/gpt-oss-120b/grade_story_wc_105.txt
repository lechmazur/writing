<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mar a's particular trait—hearing colors—drives concrete actions like translating teal and amber into tones, rooting motivation in her profession. Interiority feels embodied in sensory perceptions but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies like "memory itself is a forge" border on unearned declaration. Final change (device completion syncing orchard's heart with hers) earns mild endurance cost via collected absences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from setup to coral shard imprint, culminating in CR closure where device's chord reconfigures broken trust into "new hope" with felt weight of absences settling "into her hands." Orientation anchors early (sunken greenhouse, Mara's task). Single scene with nightly returns fits defaults; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (teal of dying rose, amber mast hum) filter through Mara's bias, constraining choices by providing color-sounds for imprinting. Recurring kelp-glass, roots-hulls evolve with sparks dissolving, charging final aurora-painted chord. Environment shapes final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint trust's breaking sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening absences (coral shard to full chord), narrowing to sync with orchard's grief. Agency in recording lullaby forecloses path with emotional cost (orchard's "grief," personal "weight"). One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory forging resonance from loss emerges organically via color-pulses and absences, reweighted in final "tapestry woven from colors, absences," answering trust's rupture non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "even in loss, sound can be reborn." Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (colors as tones); voice modulates lyrically, syntax rhythmic under pressure (e.g., forge's "inhaled the void"). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible, pattern-taught early via synesthetic noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "sparks that fell like rain... each spark a tiny imprint" advances image/action/theme). Minor paraphrase loops ("returned... nightly," forge repetition) but purposeful accumulative; no closure muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud. Template cadence absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synesthesia (hearing colors as trust's sound) transforms memory trope via sunken orchard's absences/forge, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, premise fresh.</comment>
