<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to voice the unknown drives concrete micro-choices like whispering the storm name; interiority embodied in cave's breath mirroring purpose. Lacks sharply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward poetic summary over crisis tension. Final realization earned via prior mapping actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of droplets, glows building to CR closure in "understood that to become the voice... amplify the silence that already lived within them," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-reflection in stones. Orientation anchored early in cave and post-hibernation frame. One tightening via merging droplet suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave network and basin constrain choices, with mineral filaments aligning to leaf charging final pulse/heartbeat image. Sensory details (scent, tremor, vapor hues) selective via POV's mapping bias, evolving causally with glows. Micro-object (leaf) as setting guides ritual actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to craft voice via map signaled early, deepens accumulatively as droplets pulse sorrow/curiosity, forcing completion. Agency in releasing final droplet; cost legible in reconfiguration to amplifying silence, foreclosing solo speaking path. Single cadence shift reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voicing unknown emerges organically from mapping ritual to realization silence amplifies itself; final drifting leaf offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior echoes without moralizing. Subtext in cave's grief/sorrow particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tracing "hidden currents of light with a tool that recorded scent, pressure," modulating rhythm with intensity. Stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure pulse. No dialogue; diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., droplets bearing hues advance sensory/emotion mapping); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud fluid. Minor paraphrase loops in repeated "glow"/"elm leaf fossil" phrasing (-0.4), but no closure dulling or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation world, sensory cartography, and factually mystical fossil transforms tropes into organic ritual; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via cave's responsive breath. Final elk/elm drift inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
