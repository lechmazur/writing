<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in curiosity intensifies through embodied sensations like "each pulse were a drum," compelling the palm-on-hedge choice and chant; interiority concrete via visions but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning archetypal without deep flaws complicating peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from hedge shiver to portal surge, yielding Charged Poise closure in beacon ignition and hedges healing with felt binding cost; orientation anchored early in cobalt glade; one tightening via maze parting suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hedges' scars constrain linking choice and charge final healing image; sensory selectivity (rain-kissed pine, violet swirl) mirrors visionary bias, evolving causally with tremble and parting; no white-room, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock covenant signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vision density to portal crossing with agency in chant/raising clipping; cost legible in "surge of memory" binding her, foreclosing unbound path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of binding dream-duty emerges organically from scars-to-beacon arc, resonant in final tapestry image reweighting history's wounds without moralizing; purposeful ambiguity in "collective longing" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in vine-tangled, echo-sensing notices; rhythmic prose modulates from hum to roar, consistent lyrical texture without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "anxious elation" (3x) and paraphrase loops like glade/covenant echoes create mild churn dulling mid-density; metaphors coherent (time ribbon, luminous threads) but figurative density in visions borders overwrite; propulsion strong overall, read-aloud varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-linking and eclipsed covenant transforms maze trope into dream-harvest beacon; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in portal fold without gimmick.</comment>
