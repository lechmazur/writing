<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover commander's secret drives inciting spread of maps and climax unmaking, rooted in sensory traits; actions align consistently. Interiority concrete via perceptual ribbons but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal redirect beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via because/therefore: shard opens slit, tracing reveals log, final redirect stitches realities as DC with cost (shard fractures into specks). Orientation anchors Lira/bay early; single-shard structure coherent, closure reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard as micro-setting constrains redirects and charges final fracture image; sensory details (rusted hulls, humming air) filter via POV priorities, evolve causally into cascade of light. Specificity mirrors internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (withheld truth) signaled early tightens via parallel shift and log discovery under causal lens, forcing agency in final redirect with cost to shard/self (cycle unmakes, tool lost). Escalation driven by protagonist's whispers narrows to unmaking trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared truths emerges organically from sensory weaving and crew awakening; final image (specks as stars, lightness replaces weight) offers resonant CR reweighting withheld secrets without moralizing. Particulars like glass-bottle breaths avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature (currents as ribbons, prismatic aura); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, diction purposeful and character-specific without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy redirects amid lyrical builds); high density integrates action/atmosphere, but figurative density (lattice, threads) borders overwriting in opening without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory map maker + shard weaving parallels transforms multiverse trope via tactile cartography and truth-weight premise; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risks lyrical causality for charged payoff.</comment>
