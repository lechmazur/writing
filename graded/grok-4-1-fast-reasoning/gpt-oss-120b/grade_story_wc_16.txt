<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices shine in whispering promise to the tangled knot glyph, earning final acceptance; contradictory impulses (reckless yet measured steps) act simultaneously. Minor slips in repeated label-speak like "cautious exuberance."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glyphs link promises into symphony; Charged Poise closure in archive breathing and new vellum acceptance, with legible cost in "chance would slip away" and "weight of renewed covenant."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (shelves pulsing melody, walls resonating) filtered through Elara's priorities; glass ink well as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final image where light dances on it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via glyph revelations culminating in knot unwinding; agency in decoding forecloses silence with time pressure cost made legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mended promises emerges organically from glyph interconnections; final symphony image offers resonant non-literal answer to broken covenant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation builds density without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful musical metaphors propels accumulatively; minor repetition of "promise" and "sang" patterns taught early pay off, but dense figuration slightly muddles knot-unwinding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic decoding as symphonic promises transforms trope into organic magic; risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens stakes to closure without gimmickry.</comment>
