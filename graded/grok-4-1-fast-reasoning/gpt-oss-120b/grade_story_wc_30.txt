<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation to preserve wonder roots in gear-slowing under thin light, with contradictory impulses (duty vs. migration) acting in forging scene; earned change via shelf-opening forecloses static identity with gear-softening cost. Interiority concrete via creel scents and tidal perceptions. Minor abstractness in epiphany ("purpose required him to let his own identity migrate") avoids higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rupture to key-forging and creel-sealing CR, with cost in "gears soften" reconfiguring stance. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in atrium details. Single scene, one tightening via smelting; closure legible with undeniable conceptual price of migrating self.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains via rising water, furnace heat, and breathing windows that mirror internal shifts; creel as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (brine/cedar, gear hum) reflects librarian bias. Details evolve causally, e.g., water to pale teal post-crescent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder post-rupture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via smelting acceptance of contradictions, narrowing to shelf-opening agency. Cost felt in gear-softening and routine's hidden tide. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at creel-seal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of contradictory identities emerges from fluctuating books, key ripples, creel song; final scroll margin offers non-literal resonance reweighting routine as marvel. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in visitor shifts. Internal arc inextricable from paradox acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in tidal/gear filters; voice modulates rhythmically from serene to deepened glow. Prose texture distinct via syntax echoing waves (e.g., "water turned a pale teal, and the librarian felt his gears soften"). No head-hopping; elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (fire not burning, tides rippling key). Minor paraphrase loops ("wonder in routine," "migrating") in reflection but not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or template cadence; read-aloud flows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan-gears, bamboo creel, moon-fluctuating identities transforms library trope into tidal paradox engine. Risky lyric compression pays off in creel-melt CR. Irreplaceable particulars like ripple-patterned key heighten stakes organically.</comment>
