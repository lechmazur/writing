<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concrete actions like inscribing emotions on the telescope reveal character under pressure, but interiority relies on abstract epiphanies such as "heartbeats of pilots long gone" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of cloud observations building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("Aria smiled, knowing that the empty space above held its own story"); cost felt in solitary vigil endurance amid swaying gondola.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gondola and brass telescope function as micro-settings, constraining the vigil and charging the final image of lowering the telescope into the cradle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memorializing tightens via accumulative cadence shift from cloud litany to comet sighting, forcing realization with felt cost of endured isolation; agency in categorizing observations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of empty spaces remembering emerges organically through cloud emotions and final dawn image ("sky itself were stitching the broken seam"), reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature attuned to sky emotions; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative pressure, purposeful repetition taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel forward, but minor paraphrase loops on "swayed" and "quiet" motifs dull select beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation tragedy into emotional cloud taxonomy feels inevitable, transforming memorial tropes through specific, grounded poetic risks.</comment>
