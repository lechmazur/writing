<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority abstracts emotions via poetic labels rather than embodied micro-choices at shell-lifting climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with resonant reconfiguration closure (shell merges/dims into dawn, reweighting isolation); cost legible in silent pulse and receding shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (fragrant air weaving whispers, roses as pale hands) mirrors internal states and urges onward through vines, charging final violet-gold image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Density escalation via deepening twilight/resonance lattice tightens dominant stake under accumulative lens; agency in lifting shell forecloses path with dimming cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-independence emerges organically via shell/archive but explicit repetitions ("translate isolation into independence") echo thesis-like in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sigh/resonance noticing with consistent lyrical rhythm; stable single POV, though repetition slightly erodes pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "resonance structures" (5+ repeats) and transformation motifs clutter final third; overwrought figuration in most sentences dulls closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy of broken shell as memory-archive transforms isolation trope through timed dawn ritual; risks poetic density without gimmickry.</comment>
