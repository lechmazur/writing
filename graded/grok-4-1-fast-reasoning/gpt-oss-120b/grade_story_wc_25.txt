<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving actions like whispering into coin; embodied emotions in storm's tang on skin. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beats, reducing depth. Solo POV limits relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds: whisper causes map glow and path to radio/tunnel/box CR closure. Orientation anchored early (Milo in container labyrinth during storm). Cost legible in final validation reconfiguring belief ("labyrinth breathe with his rhythm").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers/storm constrain choices (glowing map path, key vibration on wall). Sensory vivid and selective (electric tang, crackle), mirroring internal validation. Final dock emergence charges image with aurora shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whisper legend) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing disbelief to validation. Agency in following map/radio tests commitment; cost felt in ritual immersion charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (whispers > shouts) emerges organically from coin/radio/parchment events, resonant in "shout that would never travel as far." Final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (storm as chorus/veins). Rhythmic diction modulates (short sentences in tunnel slip); no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but minor loops ("veins," "steel" motifs borderline patterned overkill in mid-beats). No scaffold or muddled metaphors touching closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-amplified whispers in container maze with zodiac coin/key ritual; risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from legend test to parchment payoff.</comment>
