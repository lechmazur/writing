<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to decode stone murmurs intensifies credibly through seal and lesson, with humility as felt cost in final fluency; Liora's ghost-reading particularity shines, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal tea-sharing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to on-page CR closure ("purpose of my quest became clear... newly fluent") with conceptual cost of lies-to-truth reconfiguration; two-shard structure (meteor night to next evening) transitions legibly, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden's rosemary, rusted rail, and intensifying meteor streaks constrain intimate lesson and charge final image of brick's "silent grammar"; sensory hierarchy reflects stone-obsessed POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stone-language mastery signaled early, tightens texturally via sigil pact and tea ritual deepening options; meteor pulse forces realization stance, with lies as visible ongoing cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lies bridging to stone's living dialogue emerges organically from seal's pact and final hand on seal murmuring light into brick; resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "murmurs embedded in brick and timber" biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from cosmic strobe to conspiratorial air, stable first-person distance with clean micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration, but figurative overwriting clusters in peak realization ("stitch the night's fleeting light into the brick's silent grammar") dulls propulsion slightly; minor "agreed upon lies" loops across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of stone-language quest, sugar-borrow pivot to ritual, and meteor-charged sigil transforms clandestine tropes; fresh "heartbeats of forgotten walls" inflection feels inevitable and risk-heightening.</comment>
