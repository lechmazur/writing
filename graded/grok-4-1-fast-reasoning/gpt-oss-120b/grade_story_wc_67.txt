<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Concrete embodiment like "crystalline chill travel up her arms" reveals emotion particularity, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the ritual; no blind spots or flaws complicate choices before the tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to chair's slowdown and luminescence emergence as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in "bittersweet reminder of loss and love intertwined" at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vanishing point walls and rocking chair constrain ritual steps and charge final lattice image; selective sensory details like "creaking as if breathing out memories" mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to crystallize emotion signaled early with one deepening via powder settling and gallery response; pressure coheres accumulatively but lacks sharp option-narrowing reversal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of illusion vs honest feeling emerges organically through ritual images until explicit final line "true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling" moralizes, undercutting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature in biased noticing of "faint markings" and powder patterns; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation fits lyric mode, though some compression borders opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pervasive figurative density in peak ritual ("shards catching... like broken hopes," "powder's glittering veil") overloads without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; paraphrase loops on powder actions and whisper repetitions across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash ritual in perspective-warping gallery transforms surreal tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
