<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to weave continuity is stated clearly but lacks dramatized internal contradiction or higher-stakes micro-choices; pacifism shown once in "sheathing any notion of blame" without embodied struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from solo whispers to communal vow; Charged Poise closure in elder receiving scrap makes cost legible as "weight of history settle like sand, steadying his heart."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, roses, and scrap integrate purposefully, constraining actions like whispering to roots and gathering for foundation; scrap reprises to charge final image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of continuity tightens accumulatively through acts culminating in villagers' vow; one deepening from personal to communal, but abstract stakes lack visceral opposition or trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet strength emerges organically from engraved scrap, sheathed thorns, and petal vows; final dawn image resonantly reweights chaos without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in tremors and scents; rhythmic texture fits accumulative mode, though minor repetition convergence under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motif repetition ("tranquil blaze" x4, "whisper" multiples) creates patterned cadence but paraphrase loops dull propulsion, as in adjacent "breathe/trembling" clusters; figurative density overwrites peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifist inculcating roses post-ruin, transforming tropes via engraved scrap and "tranquil blaze"; lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
