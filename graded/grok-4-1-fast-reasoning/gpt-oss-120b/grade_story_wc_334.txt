<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation clear in mission to recover memories, shown through concrete actions like tracing hulls and arranging caps; interiority concrete but leans abstract-poetic over embodied contradiction. Flash from sextant compels higher-stakes alignment without raw internal conflict. Solid micro-choices reveal curiosity but lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from exploration to sextant flash (pattern break) to cap arrangement yielding receding water and sapling reveal (RR/CR closure with conceptual cost of reweaving lost heritage). Orientation anchored early (folklorist in ghostly greenhouse by para 1). Single continuous scene fits defaults; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks vividly constrains choices—hulls guide memory mapping, kelp tangles sextant—charging final alignment; sensory hierarchy (brine air, salt-soaked soil, glowing caps) filters through folklorist's mythic bias. Recurring broken constellations on hulls evolve to mosaic in sextant/shards, mirroring internal revival. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across wrecks to center.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sextant flash narrowing to fungal alignment causing water recede; agency in arranging caps forecloses hidden-loss path with visible revival cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload. Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reweaving stolen memories from fragments emerges organically via particulars (fairy ring as archive, constellations realigning); final sapling image/CR reweights "habits break" motif with resonant ambiguity of sea's dual gift/theft. No moralizing; subtext in whispered thank-you layers nostalgia with cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from reclaimed heritage question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature—mythic pulses, spore senses—modulating rhythmically from curious catalog to charged flash. Lyrical compression taught early (constellation patterns) legible at closure; no head-hopping or leakage. Prose texture biased toward folkloric idiom without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short sentences in flash surge); high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loops on "broken constellations" (4x) and "fairy ring glow" dull slightly but pattern-taught for payoff; no filter stacks or template cadence in peak. Closure image clear/propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore (fairy rings) with shipwrecked mythic memory-currents transforms tropes via grounded sensory mapping; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically. Core premise inevitable in hindsight from hull etchings to sapling recharge; no derivative hedging.</comment>
