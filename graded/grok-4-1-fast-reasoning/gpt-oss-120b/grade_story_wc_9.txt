<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear in ritual for twins' sighs, rooted in self-promise, with embodied release at "unfasten the last knot of her own heart"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward declarative perplexity without scene-tested struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure in saucer healing and droplet rite, with felt cost of grief release; orientation anchored early in glade and task; one tightening in fissure widening to staircase suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Midnight glade and mist staircase constrain ritual choices, charging final crystal blossom image; sensory selection (scent of forgotten mornings, choking velvet air) reflects urgency and POV ritual focus without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cloudbound repentance tightens via widening fissure and heart unfastening, narrowing to droplet agency with legible grief cost; escalation accumulates texturally but lacks sharp option foreclosure beyond poetic deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending lost time through repentance emerges organically via saucer crack and reclaimed dew, resonant in star-rain finale reweighting paradox without moral; subtext in vapor promises enriches without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward constellations and sighs; rhythmic modulation builds to "universe stitched together," purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but overwriting in repeated "choking beauty" and stacked metaphors ("sang like wind-chimes," "velvet" air) muddle peak fissure beat; minor paraphrase loops in glade pulsing dull minor momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy ritual in cloud glade transforms tropes via time-dew and saucer map; risk in lyric paradox payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable vapor staircase.</comment>
