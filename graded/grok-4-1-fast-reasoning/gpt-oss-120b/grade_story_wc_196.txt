<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation to magnify kindnesses drives consistent micro-choices like tracing silhouettes, but interior conflict feels summarized rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene; broken heart endures with cost at closure, yet epiphanies like "quiet solidarity" border on unearned therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust/button revelations builds to CR closure in final image of new file and rising dust reweighting forgotten histories with endured heartbreak cost; orientation anchored early in file room; one tightening via supervisor display suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-setting constrain discoveries and charge final image of balloon sketch; sensory details like "thin veil of dust rose, unfurling like a silent flag" selectively mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring unknown histories escalates texturally through deepening revelations (button projections to new file), narrowing to Charged Poise endurance with heartbreak cost legible in "heart still broken but steadier"; agency in presenting to supervisor forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses blooming into history emerges organically from button/dust particulars, resonant CR in final sketch without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "histories that refuse to die" reweighting neglect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward dust/object textures stable in single POV; supervisor dialogue natural/subtextual in softening eyes; minor overwriting slippage but rhythm modulates hope under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "unfurl" (5+ uses) and dust synonym loops create template cadence, dulling density in revelation beats; figurative overload like "filament of dust a reminder" in most sentences obscures propulsion without pattern payoff; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh magical-textural synthesis of button/dust projecting foster histories transforms archive trope; button's evolution from tarnished prop to beacon feels inevitable, risking sentimentality but heightening stakes organically.</comment>
