<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in folding grief into cranes, embodied in polishing ritual; actions align with crafty traits under pressure. Interiority poetic but lacks sharply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward summary. Final endurance of torment earned via prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shadow detachment to basilica quiver and crane lift-off. Closure as Charged Poise in "basilica’s dome lifts... foundations quietly descend," reconfiguring paradox with felt torment cost on-page. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via shadow drift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: jasmine steam, dew-slick stone constrain and mirror polishing actions. Tea garden bamboo arches and floating isle mist evolve causally, charging final crane swirl. Recurring basilica constrains closure image, POV-filtered through lantern maker's light-weaving bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief transformation) signaled early, deepens texturally via gem passes turning "raw grief into filament." Agency in ritual choices narrows to basilica transformation; cost legible in "luminous torment ease, not disappear." Escalation coherent under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Paradoxical grief ascent/descent emerges organically from crane folding and basilica glow, reweighting premise in final "heart that can ascend even as it descends." Images shift meaning without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light-as-liquid metaphors ("ripple like water"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure hum. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in image-propelled lines; minor figurative density in peak ("luminous torment fills the air") borders overwriting but pattern-taught. Slight paraphrase loops in ascend/descend paradox phrasing dull minor beats, not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-polishing, shadow paradox, grief-cranes transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from basilica's gold translucence; no derivative echoes.</comment>
