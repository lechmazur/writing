<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pruner's reverence and creativity motivate consistent actions like planting the seed and singing to the storm, shown through embodied tending; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reducing depth in pivotal storm endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from seed planting to spores, storm transmutation, and traveler's sprig as Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in ongoing tending, no orientation debt past early anchoring at parapet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (mist's sigh, waterfall's lullaby) mirrors wonder and constrains planting via moonlit pool; recurring waterfall evolves with storm/rain, charging final hope image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder escalates accumulatively via storm threat (tightening through song transmutation) and traveler's plea, forcing endurance with felt cost in patient succor; agency in sprig gift narrows isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transmuted wonder emerges organically from sigils, spores, and sprig without statement; final image reweights prior sorrow-to-hope arc resonantly, inviting ambiguity on endless tending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward radiant hues stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation builds hush to chorus without drift, traveler dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting via stacked metaphors (liquid amber, misty sigh) and "radiant hush"/succor loops dull density in high-pressure storm beat; paraphrase churn on wonder/glow reduces propulsion despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard magic realism with world-weaving via spores/sigils transforms folklore tropes; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in storm/transmuting without gimmickry.</comment>
