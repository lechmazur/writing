<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selene's interiority shines in embodied moments like her heart racing to capture the phoenix's lesson, with micro-choices in plant arrangements revealing contradictory doubts and cunning under pressure. Final realization that imperfection is the truest melody earns change with felt cost in softened flaws. Minor slip in overt epiphanic phrasing like "she finally understood" slightly undercuts raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through successive plant-reed barters toward CR closure in the courtyard's full awakening and glass flowers sprouting, reweighting her sight with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in courtyard and phoenix rebirth. One tightening via ivy-lotus finale suffices; cost legible in "spectrum no eye could name."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via reed, plants, and furnace glow shaping arrangements and hues; glass walls and shards evolve causally, charging final image of sprouting glass flowers. Sensory details selective (leaf veins pulsing, metallic sighs) mirror Selene's biased perception. Micro-setting like cracked vase guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to perceive beauty in imperfection signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening hues and barters narrowing symmetric dreams to asymmetrical grace. Agency in coaxing plants forecloses perfection path with felt cost in "flaws soften into something luminous." Guardrail met: tightening forces trade-off charging finale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's grace emerges organically from particulars like wilted rosemary-cactus barter and cracked vase, culminating in resonant CR where glassblower whispers fissure stories reweight prior ruins. Subtext in images avoids morals; final mural honors ambiguity without tidy assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature in sensed colors (muted teal) and biased noticing; single POV stable, modulating rhythm with intensity. Glassblower's whisper natural, subtext-laden. Minor register elevation in poetic flourishes fits lyric mode without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with propulsion syncing scene (short pulses in reed vibrations); density high, metaphors coherent like "folded metal surfaces shimmering like a tongue." Repetition of "bartered awakenings" purposeful motif, no loops; minor density slip in figurative stacks mid-beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind synesthesia via reed-plant code transforms imperfection trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via courtyard's causal evolution to glass flowers. Bold premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
