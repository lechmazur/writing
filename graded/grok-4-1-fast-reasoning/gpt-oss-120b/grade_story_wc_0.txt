<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots clearly in her shift from supernovas to dust, with embodied humility in "tending to garden ghosts"; internal conflict acts in scene via observations yielding relief laughter. Final endurance of gradual change feels earned with cost of bowing equations. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "kindled humility" borders therapy-speak but anchors to present vial-handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vial collection to weekly shifts, culminating in CR via greenhouse revival image reweighting dust's subtle power; cost legible in "precise equations must bow." Orientation anchors immediately in greenhouse post-flood. One tightening via cracks widening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "fractured beams" and "droplets fell" integrate into actions, mirroring decay-to-revival; greenhouse constrains observations and vial placement, charging final pulse under boots. POV bias filters via scientific eye on humidity gradients. No white-room; evolves causally with air inflow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dust preprocessing via patterns) signals early, escalates texturally through deepening observations narrowing to revival confirmation; agency in recording shifts forecloses dramatic theories with humility cost. One decisive intensification via dust arranging in cracks suffices. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of tiny disturbances driving gradual change emerges organically from dust catalysis and beam decay; final vine whisper offers resonant CR without overt moral. Notebook line "universe preprocesses... joins the chorus" risks thematic echo, docking score despite buildup from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: scientific lyricism in "snowfall" settling and "breathing" walls. Rhythmic control modulates from cautious entry to exhaled sigh; purposeful compression in time-lapse observations taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-task image/action like "brushed the butterfly dust... like snowfall." Varied rhythm avoids monotony; minor figurative density in opening ("wounded beast") purposeful for tone, not muddling peaks. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars to butterfly dust preprocessing reality transforms post-storm ruin trope into subtle revival; risk in gradual timeframe heightens humility stakes organically. Core premise commits fully, with dust's iridescent patterns inevitable in hindsight for closure.</comment>
