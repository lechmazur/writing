<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's embodied purpose ("pulsed like a heartbeat") and herald's paradoxical joy compel ritual choices effectively; herald remains more symbolic than agentic with micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from lantern arrival to prophetic symbols tightening urgency, landing CR in final vow and dawn where shadowed elation's cost reconfigures renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse and prism constrain inward beam redirection, charging closure image of glowing walls humming renewal; sensory details (phosphorescent pulse, silver waves) evolve purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ritual before tide erases) deepens accumulatively via prophetic realization forcing "act now"; agency in lifting lantern forecloses inaction with legible joyous melancholy cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shadowed renewal emerges organically from light-serpent steering darkness, answered non-literally in vow using ancient shadows to paint dawn; final image reweights prophecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual bias toward rippling shadows and phosphorescent glow; rhythmic modulation peaks in "serpent slithered," dialogue sparse but subtextual in whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in peak ritual ("beam became a living serpent") propels with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in glow/light motifs slightly dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optics ritual (total internal reflection bending photons) transforms lighthouse trope inward; risk in lyric textural drive heightens shadowed rebirth stakes organically.</comment>
