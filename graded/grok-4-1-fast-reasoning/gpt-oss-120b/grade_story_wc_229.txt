<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove whispers' power drives concrete micro-choices like placing the cork and breaking its seal, with embodied tears and "screaming tenderness" surge showing contradictory love under pressure. Interiority particular via vibration perceptions, earning realization without unearned epiphany. Minor slip: occasional label-speak like "purest intentions" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (scent, vapor, light) to fisherman's tug and boat arrival as CR closure, reweighting premise with emotional cost in Mara's tears and lighthouse "exhale." Orientation anchors immediately (Mara, balcony, dawn). One tightening via cork-crack cascade suffices; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and balcony constrain choices (cork placement at edge) and charge final image as "heart beating in rhythm," with dawn/sea/dew mirroring internal states through tactile action. Sensory hierarchy (scent over sight initially) reflects Mara's intent focus. Vivid, selective details like "dew on her skin" evolve causally without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers via intent) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: vapor curl to beam sync to fisherman's heartbeat tug, deepening with cork seal-break forcing emotional trade-off in tears. Agency in beckoning forecloses doubt; cost legible in "fierce love that shouted silently."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of softened intent's power emerges organically via particulars (vial, scent, fisherman's pull), culminating in resonant CR: lighthouse as "bridges that spanned continents" reweights shouts/whispers without moralizing. Subtext in silent "sigh" and dew affirms complexity; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature of "humming vibration" and rhythmic prose modulating to short pulses at climax ("each pulse gently purifying"). Diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at cork-crack payoff. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (long builds to crisp climax lines like "a bright cascade of light spilled"); high density in multi-job sentences. Minor deduction for figurative density ("vibrations like a quiet chord") in peak without obscuring closure, but purposeful pattern holds propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism (vial cork purifying intent via garden scent) transforms lighthouse trope into textural bridge-building premise. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via fisherman's pull; no template echoes, bold in "whispers into bridges."</comment>
