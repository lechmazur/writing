<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via tasting spoon moments reveals character under pressure; motivation rooted in radical creation drives micro-choices like whispering to vines. Minor abstraction in "informally wise" lacks one contradictory impulse in peak alignment beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in seed burst and glowing greenhouse; cost legible in "shedding the last of their dead weight." Orientation anchored in opening lines; one tightening at alignment zenith holds lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains via responsive vines and arches that groan, charging final amber glow image. Sensory details (hiss, scents, pulse) selective through Mara's tasting bias; evolves causally from rust to ruby veins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of renewal tightens via alignment pulse narrowing to seed placement; agency in coaxing plasticity forecloses complacency path. Cost felt in pruning ideologies; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically from pruning actions and spore integration; final beacon image offers non-literal resonant answer to ruins-without-listening premise. Avoids moralizing, lingers via amber pulse reweighting collective memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in memory-tasting; rhythmic prose modulates to hum/pulse under alignment stress. Lyrical diction consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies in alignment climax. Slight overwrite penalty for stacked metaphors ("rippling like a thought," "fireflies") in burst beat without tighter pattern teach, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synaptic plants and memory broth transforms ruin tropes; seed burst turn inevitable from particulars. Bold risk in plasticity mechanics heightens stakes organically.</comment>
