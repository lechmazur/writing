<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation to decipher story magnetism, rooted in watchful traits and donor heart sync, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; scroll revelation delivers epiphany without embodied struggle or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with imagery density building from wing/sun trails to scroll/garden/loom; on-page CR closure via loom activation reconfigures Lira's role with felt pact cost in final cascade image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (amber mist, steam ribbons, crystal flowers) filter through Lira's dye-master gaze and constrain choices like following illuminated paths; recurring floating rock and loom charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of story magnetism signaled early with insight deepening via scroll as sufficient tightening under Accumulative lens; abstract pressure lacks visceral cost until loom placement forecloses passive watching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of iridescent caution drawing stories emerges organically from wing/scroll particulars, reweighted in final loom beacon without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in light cascade ties to Lira's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in nature-script noticing; rhythmic poetic texture modulates from quiet observation to charged insight, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (sun trails as script) taught early and propelling to closure; varied rhythm avoids loops, though dense metaphors border coherence in garden beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye-master lore, donor heart rhythm, and story-magnetism via morpho wing transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes toward beacon closure.</comment>
