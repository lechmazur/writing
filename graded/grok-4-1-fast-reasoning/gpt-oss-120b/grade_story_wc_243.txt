<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to complicate renewal; archivist's serenity and ritual actions lack flaws or micro-choices revealing values under pressure, as in the untroubled writing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands on-page at "covenant’s promise settle like dew on his soul," reconfiguring purpose with felt emotional cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density tightening to sea crescendo; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains choice to stay/write as tide laps boots; locket recurs to charge final "cool metal pulse like a heart" image, mirroring internal states through sensory evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of covenant renewal signaled early escalates accumulatively to "sea’s chant rose to a crescendo"; writing agency deepens pressure, narrowing to final sentence with unmistakable dread/delight cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-preservation emerges organically from locket-to-pact links; final "dew on his soul" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting small moments' weight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic ink-tide-memory notices; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, with purposeful repetition taught early; stable single POV, capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Exact-phrase loops ("haunted euphoria" x4, "regenerated covenant" x3) and paraphrase redundancy dull propulsion throughout, including closure; over-dense figurative stacking lacks breath in peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh archivist-myth premise transformed via ink-proximate covenant renewal; lyric risk in repetitive texture heightens remembrance stakes organically without obscuring closure.</comment>
