<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in patient's musing leading to discovery, with embodied emotion in "heart beat in cadence with the unseen frequencies." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; smooth progression feels competent but untested by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations accumulate density to guide discovery; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "ending a line was not about destruction, but about transforming silence." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via intuition map suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia reading room and recurring golden shadows constrain choices (ear to carved panel, lift floorboards) and charge final image of receding shadows. Sensory details selective and POV-biased toward intuition; environment evolves with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, deepens via standing waves narrowing to compartment lift under Accumulative lens. Agency in micro-choices like cranking forces realization cost, legible in deepened shadows approving discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of intuition bridging silenced history emerges organically from gramophone waves and scroll confession, with final image offering resonant non-literal answer on transforming eloquence. No moralizing; complexity in betrayal lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of "golden shadows" and rhythmic modulation during vibrations; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits Accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("eloquently silent" thrice, "golden shadows" repeatedly) creates loops dulling momentum; high figurative density in peak discovery ("vibrations dancing like ribbons of light") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gramophone crank decoding wood cipher via standing waves transforms trope of hidden family secret into fresh vibrational intuition; risk-taking in lyric motifs heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
