<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—protecting the harbor versus breaking free—act simultaneously in her decision to sing and release the scrimshaw, earning the final resolve with visible cost in detaching from the bone at the altar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density building from scrimshaw pulse to whale shadow rise; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page when island lingers and Mara returns changed, cost felt in scrimshaw's release and centuries' weight lifting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae and basalt altar constrain choices like placing the scrimshaw and singing, charging the tower climax; sensory hierarchy (sea hum, salt spray) filters through Mara's dock-worker perception without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via true nature) signaled early tightens accumulatively through whale call response and crystal flare, forcing endurance in singing amid pull; agency in releasing scrimshaw forecloses past attachment with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of detaching from violence to embrace tenderness emerges organically from song unlocking spirits, reweighting prior harbor silence without moralizing; final harbor calm offers non-literal resonant answer to central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sea-biased perceptual signature (currents, foam as daggers) modulates rhythmically; poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High figurative density in climax ("vortex lifted boots," "edges softened") borders overwriting without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; repetitive "combative tenderness" (4x) and "unlock/guarded hearts" echoes create paraphrase loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of scrimshaw-island-whale song transforms pirate trope through combative tenderness calculus; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
