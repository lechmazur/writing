<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to articulate needs clear and consistent, driving presses and encoding; strengths in trait specificity like "driftingly alert." Weakness: interiority remains abstractly poetic without embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under storm pressure, e.g., no felt hesitation at second press.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of three flashes building resonance to Charged Poise closure in "permanent mural of shared heartbeat"; cost legible in ghost's folding and ongoing archive plea. Orientation anchored early in courtyard; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: wind, thunder, mist constrain graffiti action and charge final "mist swirled, catching...sighs." Atmosphere tensions human/digital via stone pores and shifting colors; recurring walls enable pivotal encoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate ghost) signaled early; accumulative escalation via flash-deepening (plea to name-projection) driven by balladeer's agency narrows to alignment. Cost unmistakable in "thread that bound his song to the unseen code."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically from flower-code bridges; final "living archive" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing. Subtext in binary sighs vs. petal grounding enriches without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (synesthetic "humming...ghost in code") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable close-third POV biases toward symbolic noticing. Compression purposeful and taught early for lyric payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports propulsion, with high density in flash beats; purposeful figurative pattern (e.g., "binary blossoms") pays off without muddle. Minor deduction for occasional paraphrase loops like repeated "glowed faintly" in press reprises.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore balladeer with digital ghost via graffiti encoding feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
