<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Recluse's traits (tranquilly perceptive, astonished) root consistent motivation to preserve silence, embodied in shallow breath and palm dust; micro-choices like tracing ruby line reveal values under ghost pressure. Internal conflict emerges accumulatively via contradictory impulses to break vs. hold covenant, earning stasis in final resolve. Minor abstraction in "searching for meaning" lacks deeper contradictory layering mid-story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dawn gaze through pattern alignments (ghosts, symbols) to closure's Charged Poise in amber tear sealing covenant, with legible cost of endured silence vs. shattering scream. Single scene anchored early (oasis, recluse); no orientation debt. One tightening via box pulse narrows to honoring pact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (scorched oasis, withered melons, dying flowers) filters through recluse's perceptive bias, constraining preservation via whispers of bees and ash; sensory mix (hum, honey scent, wind ripples) evolves causally to charge final amber tear image. Recurring hives/box guide choices tactilely. Micro-setting (glass house, pedestal) mirrors internal covenant without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken weight vs. unleashing scream) signaled early, tightens texturally via symbol match and box hum, forcing endurance with felt cost in ghost swirl and ghost fade. Agency in lifting/placing forecloses breaking path. Minor abstractness in stakes ("weight shatter world") slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mute eloquence vs. shattering speech emerges organically from bee/spirit pact images, reweighted in final light-fracture and amber seal offering non-literal answer to covenant question. Subtext in ghost pauses and silent dance invites ambiguity without confusion; no moralizing. Resonance from particulars (ruby wing, molten tear) avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ripples as truths, colors as words); voice texture modulates rhythmically from calm observation to charged hum/pulse under pressure. Prose syntax reflects tranquil mind, with purposeful lyric compression taught early. No elision issues; diction biased to covenant motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density advances atmosphere/character via multi-job lines (e.g., "traced a line of ruby across a broken wing" fuses action, clue, image); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops ("understood," "promise") and metaphor density (veil, kaleidoscope, stone lake) create slight scaffold in mid-beats, dulling propulsion without closure harm (−0.6 accum.). Clean grammar, no artifacts at end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc beekeeping ghosts and glass covenant transforms tropes via perceptual silence pact; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in ghost-box alignment without gimmickry. Final tear seals inevitable ingenuity from early clues. No derivative echoes; voice commits singularly.</comment>
