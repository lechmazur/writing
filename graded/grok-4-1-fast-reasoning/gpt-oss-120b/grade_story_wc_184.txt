<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's methodical traits drive concrete micro-choices like reweaving braids, earning her realization that absence builds bridges; interiority ties to cataloguing impulse without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from door sighting to resonant chords in reweaving; closure as RR (door dissolution, frozen clock) lands on-page with conceptual cost of stillness, anchors clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower gears and vault constrain descent and reweaving, charging final frozen mechanisms image; sensory hierarchy (ticking, hum) reflects Mara's priorities, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake to resolve door paradox deepens accumulatively via seal-to-rope linkage and braid chords narrowing to golden light; cost legible in stilled tower reweighting time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Absence theme emerges organically from fables shaping reweaving stakes to final bridge realization, reweighting premise in recording entry without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of stories-in-objects (cogs as tales, braids as verses); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise at door ripple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Figurative density ("fables whispered," "copper-glinting strands") risks muddle in vault beat without obscuring closure; minor "fables of absence" patterning nears loop but serves textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rope-reweaving to unlock absence-door paradox transforms archival tropes into fresh methodical fantasy synthesis, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
