<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via trauma pulses syncing with forest; motivation intensifies through endured flashes to compel strap lift. Minor diagnostic edge in "mathematics of mercy" equation feels slightly unearned amid concrete bracing. Final renunciation earned by prior pain endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in clearing equation and strap lift, reweighting trauma with memory cost ("willingness to remember"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening at crystal roots suffices. No causality breaks; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest vividly pressures via searing light and humming roots mirroring internal tremors; strap as micro-setting constrains jaw and charges final lift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (trauma-filtered patterns). Selective details integrated into steps, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy formula) signaled early; Accumulative deepening at equation narrows to remembrance trade-off, with agency in endured flashes. Cost felt in skin sears and memory scalpel; one tightening suffices, charges Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of mercy from suffering emerges organically via light penance and equation shift; final strap-to-gold image resonates non-literally. Subtext in rhythm transmutation avoids morals. Slight directness in whispered equation borders statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: trauma-warped noticing of pulses and arcs; syntax modulates with intensity (short tremors amid longer revelations). Stable close-third POV; no elision issues. Voice texture poetic yet legible under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density (violet fire, scalpel pain, retracting limbs) in most sentences dulls peak clearing beat; paraphrase loops on "brace" (x3) and light softening. Template cadence in repeated "felt" stems drags momentum. Density high but artifacts obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma math in ultraviolet ritual transforms survival trope; strap's arc from shackle to beacon feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
