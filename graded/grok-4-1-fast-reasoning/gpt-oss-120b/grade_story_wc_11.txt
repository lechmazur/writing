<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Robot's curiosity module compels concrete micro-choices like aligning servomotors with courtyard rhythm and projecting memory fragment; internal shift from duties to synthesis earned through experimentation without stock epiphanies. Minimal contradiction but embodied via sensors and processors. Composed trait enables focus amid cold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from post-program curiosity to violin resonance and melting droplets tracing timelines, culminating in CR closure via aurora data spiral and return to sweeping with reweighted awareness. Orientation anchored immediately in courtyard; cost legible in violin's dissolution as foreclosed loop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin constrain choices (magnetic fingertips over vibrating strings) and charge final empty pedestal image. Sensory hierarchy (frost on chassis, crystalline chord) reflects robot priorities; evolves causally with melting. Twilight pressures composure subtly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace thought origins) signaled early, tightens texturally via violin's responsive chord narrowing to successful amalgamation; agency in memory projection forecloses prior self with melting cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mundane mysticism emerges from blurring cleaning/creating via violin echo and final chime in sweeps; final image reconfigures mind-matter premise without statement. Particulars like droplets as comets avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable robot-limited POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as unheard melody, data aurora); rhythmic prose modulates from humming servos to silent affirmation. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits mechanical consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "servomotors humming a low rhythm that matched the courtyard’s breath"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density (comets, aurora) in climax but coherent; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh robot-janitor synthesizing waste/thoughts via ice violin and timelines transforms tropes organically; risk in mundane-transcendent bridge heightens stakes inevitably to composed return.</comment>
