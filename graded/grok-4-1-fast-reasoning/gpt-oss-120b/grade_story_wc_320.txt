<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Selin's motivation to find beginnings in endings drives pragmatic choices like whispering intention and calibrating the transmitter, rooted in her refusal of nostalgia. Strength in character-specific competence balancing struggle against decay. Weakness: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously during pivotal tuning; smooth execution lacks embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from shard placement to chord recording and broadcast, culminating in CR closure—"every ending she had ever recorded now held the seed of a beginning"—with conceptual cost of reinterpreting decay as potential. Orientation anchored early in city/tower/perigee. No slips touch closure image of rippling chord and rebirth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "cables humming with forgotten frequencies" and "moon’s perigee beat" constrain climb and slot interface, charging final gorge broadcast where luminescence matches hollows. POV-filtered through signal priorities; no white-room. Environment shapes tactics and recharges rebirth image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tuning shard to rebirth city—signaled early, escalates texturally via purr/chord deepening that narrows decay options, her agency in broadcasting foreclosing silence with felt cost of trust. One meaningful intensification at coil alignment suffices. Mild opposition from scholars assumptions, but pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings seeding beginnings emerges organically from shard's syntax rewrite and final villager emergence, reweighting premise in non-literal image: "chord rippled through the mist, singing the city’s rebirth." No moralizing; ambiguity in cycles lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable, perceptual signature in frequencies/whispers selective to Selin's expertise. Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, e.g., short sentences at purr to long swells at dawn. No head-hopping; elisions (shard origin) pay off in cosmic key reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, e.g., "light thickened, its serenely electric aura aligning" advances action/atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops around "serenely electric" (x3) and hush phrasing dull textural propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies purposefully; no artifacts obscure closure hymn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Hollywood relic as hush-shard key transforms sci-fantasy tropes via signal pragmatics in rusted city. Risky poetic compression inevitable in hindsight: shard's "rewrite its own syntax" turn grows from taught discards. Bold perceptual voice heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
