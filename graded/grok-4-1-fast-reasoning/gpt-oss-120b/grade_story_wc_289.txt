<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as thread-seeker, embodied in whispers and steps onto spiral; actions align with ghostwriter traits. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating choices; epiphany feels serene without micro-struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach to pulse/eruption to CR where Mira rejoins chorus, reweighting secrets with conceptual cost in glowing thread and exhaled sigh. Single scene anchored early (Mira at temple post-rain); no orientation debt; closure legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vivid/selective: lily pond, rain ribbons, twig helix constrain choices (stepping on, petal placement) and charge final image (spiral as monument). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward iridescent/whimsical; integrates via action without stalls; recurring spiral evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find/rejoin connecting thread) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via perfume response, mosaic glow, light cascade forcing stance crystallization. Agency in whispers/placement forecloses isolation with felt cost in tugged heart and sealed confession; quiet pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of secrets as connecting strands emerges organically from letters-into-mosaic, petal-stanza, ink-constellations; final image reconfigures keeper role without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (twigs hum heartbeat) avoids platitudes; invites ambiguity in endless cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (whimsical synesthesia: words fold, colors sigh); rhythmic prose modulates intensity. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at CR; diction POV-plausible without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm drives momentum; purposeful repetition ("prismatic quiet," "thread") patterns motif without loops. Minor overwriting in peak (cascading metaphors like "blossomed with constellations" coherent but thick); no scaffold or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriter's unsent letters conduit via twig-helix in magical temple transforms love-secret trope organically. Risky lyric escalation to ink-stars pays off in inevitable CR; specific details (thrush twigs, lotus petal) anchor whimsy without gimmick.</comment>
