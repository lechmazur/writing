<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to recapture verses for the garden drives consistent micro-choices like weaving threads and diving into ink, but embodied emotions lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority favors poetic labels over concrete conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building from mirrors/threads to ink river and garden; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "true recapture was not of objects, but of stories that set them free," reweighting premise with felt cost in pulsing trapped freedom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracked mirrors and rusted slot constrain navigation and portal opening; fog/ink evolve causally, mirroring internal paradox while sharpening sensory urgency in dive where "each bubble a syllable."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recapturing verses tightens via portal/dive into accumulative density that narrows to garden realization; agency in net-weaving and blossom-gathering forecloses aimless drift with legible cost in "weight and the release of unkindled solace."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stories freeing trapped elements emerges organically from ink syllables blooming into names; final image of ship turning "toward a horizon stitched with letters" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in fantastical notices like "eyes shimmering with half-remembered maps"; rhythmic modulation peaks coherently in dive without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering fits lyric voice, but consistent metaphor-per-sentence in peak dive beat ("water wrap around her like a storybook, each bubble a syllable") risks overwriting opacity; minor "forgotten" paraphrase loops dull propulsion twice mid-text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of carnival ship labyrinth, ink verses, and name-garden transforms discovery tropes into inevitable pattern; risk-taking in backward ink river heightens stakes organically to charged closure.</comment>
