<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unravel the prophecy drives consistent micro-choices like cataloging buttons and turning the hourglass, earning her final step onto the sand bridge. Interiority ties to embodied actions (hands measuring sand, buttons vibrating), but slips into abstract diagnostic phrasing like "She understood her motivation: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility" dilute contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density (buttons, echo, sand) tightening to CR closure in the sand bridge image, where prophecy reconfigures with conceptual cost of deliberate reversal. Orientation anchors early ("amber warehouse beneath cliffs," Mara as turner); single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber warehouse, jar, and buttons constrain choices (vibrating kinship, arrangement into river) and charge final image (light swells, walls pulse). Sensory selection (dust hum, glow breathing) vivid and POV-biased toward wisdom in grains/objects, evolving causally with echo burst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unscrambling prophecy escalates via textural deepening (buttons match engraving, chorus unscrambles verses), narrowing to arrangement and turning with legible cost in shifting grain weight. Agency in Mara's deliberate acts forces reconfiguration; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom as living conversation emerges from particulars (buttons as echoes, sand gathering memory), resonant in final bridge without moralizing. Complexity lingers in prophecy's "raw possibility" reweighting time; no Thematic Echo despite close calls like "world could change when its keepers turned time with care."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature (noticing wisdom in sand/buttons) and rhythmic prose modulating to charged poise at "cliffs listened as if hearing themselves." Compression purposeful and pattern-taught; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in turning/arranging accelerate), high density integrates action/image. Minor paraphrase loops ("quietly inspired" x2, "echo" churn) and figurative density in peak burst ("roar was not destruction but a song") risk slight opacity, but coherent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of buttons cataloging prophecy with jar echo/hourglass uniquely transforms time-reversal trope; final sand bridge inevitable from prior motifs. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise implications.</comment>
