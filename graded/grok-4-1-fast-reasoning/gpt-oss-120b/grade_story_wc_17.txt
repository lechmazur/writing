<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries, compelling mapping choices; interiority concrete via sensory translations like "visual darkness into audible resonance." Final acceptance of shared legacy earned by prior probes, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fire/diaries to film/hum/map, tightening to Charged Poise closure where burden reconfigures into communion with legible cost (weight "settle like warm ash"). Orientation anchored early in passage entry; one meaningful deepening via film use suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and post-climate mist/rain constrain choices (e.g., firelight reveals film) and charge final image of "living tapestry"; sensory details (hum, thunder rhythm) selective via Lira's auditory bias. Recurring stone/ivy mirrors internal states through tactile pressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover walls' dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via film discovery deepening knowledge/options; agency in pressing negative elicits hum, forcing stance shift. Cost felt in "legacy’s burden" endurance, visible in shared tokens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of walls as living histories emerges organically from mappings, reweighting burden to communion in final image without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: walls "open their eyes," charging collective imagination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in echo-visual synesthesia (e.g., "ghostly silhouettes... she could almost hear"); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged hum moment. No head-hopping; diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "legacy’s burden" loops (repeated 4x) create minor paraphrase churn; figurative density (e.g., "green-threaded artery," "sigh trapped in stone") risks overwriting in opening without full pattern payoff. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise of echo cartography transforms walls into dreaming entities; film-as-lantern reprise and seasonal dream evolution feel inevitable. Risky synesthetic mapping heightens stakes organically.</comment>
