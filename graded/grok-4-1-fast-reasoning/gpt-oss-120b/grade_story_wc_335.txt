<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in nervous backward steps yielding to steady forward progress, earning final fierce guardianship; flaw of retreat complicates early choices with visible cost before resolution. Interiority concrete via tea geometry and shadow quiver, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tea annotation to map discovery to altar healing as CR/RR, with sun alignment as felt cost in precise moment; one tightening via leaf-unlocked sequence narrows exile reversal options on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library dust, teacups, warped manuscripts constrain choices (e.g., crack prompts backward scan, altar placement heals walls), charging final image; sensory integration (pine air, swing chains) mirrors internal resilience without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quiet mentorship tightens accumulatively via nervous crack confrontation forcing stance shift; agency in repeated annotations forecloses retreat path with emotional cost legible in steady steps and shadow fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges organically from tea/map progression to wall-healing image reweighting neglect as pilgrimage; no moralizing, resonance in pentagon oath shifting despair to endurance without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in geometric noticing (triangles/spirals/pentagon) biases details to resilience; lyrical compression taught early, modulates rhythmically without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Patterned repetition ("reversible exile") serves accumulative texture but creates minor paraphrase loops in mid-section; dense metaphors cohere until minor vehicle clash in "blade of a promise," slightly dulling altar peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea geometry decoding and shadow imprisonment transforms exile trope via archivist's specific geometry obsession; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at healing cascade, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
