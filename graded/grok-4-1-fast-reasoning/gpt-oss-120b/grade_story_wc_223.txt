<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's crisis actor paradox roots motivation to chronicle pawns, compelling patterns that earn her final peace; embodied resolve in "teeth" of terror and shoulder weight strengthens, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in walking beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as walking patterns densify to scroll reveal ("soft click") and final placement/step-out CR, reconfiguring her historian role with felt cost (gesture weight); orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's echoes amplify footsteps and chorus, constraining word-spelling method; chessboard's "luminous absence" mirrors internal states and charges final scroll placement, with selective sensory hierarchy (rustle, vibration).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve gestures signaled early, deepens via scroll (pawn acts revealed) narrowing to record/placement under Accumulative lens; agency in patterns forecloses oblivion path with legible cost ("weight...settle on her shoulders").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures vs. grand narratives emerges organically from pawn absence and patterns, reweighted in final image of penumbra following without moral; penumbra/pruning subtly tensions benevolence, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (paradox eyes, luminous absence); poetic diction/rhythm modulates deliberately with intensity, e.g., "inhale and exhale" echoes gallery; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density ("light...ribbons," "nomadic penumbra") purposeful for texture but overwrites in opening without quick pattern teach (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops ("benevolently ruthless" x2, "quiet" motifs) and synonym churn dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking words on pawn-less chessboard transforms interregnum tropes into gesture historiography; penumbra's pruning and "luminous absence" feel inevitable in hindsight, risking poetic conceit successfully.</comment>
