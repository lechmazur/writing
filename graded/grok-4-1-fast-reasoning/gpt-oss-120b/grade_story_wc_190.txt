<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to teach silence comfort drives consistent micro-choices like whispering counter-tones; embodied in vial monitoring and self-dissolution at closure. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("She understood that to catalyze comfort...") borders therapy-speak but ties to actions without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence motifs builds to RR closure in vial's emptying and Lira's fulfilled mission with legible self-cost ("dissolve the agitation within herself"). Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace and vial as micro-settings constrain choices (speed adjustments, whispers) and charge final image of garden landing; sensory details (singing stones, amber pulse) selective and POV-biased toward calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalyze calm) signaled early; accumulative escalation via motif density (storm fade, vial burst) forces stance crystallization in self-dissolution. Visible cost alters tactics toward peace without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges organically from vial, whispers, and terrace images; final empty vial and "world exhaled" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fluid, lyric diction ("violet bands," "fractured lullabies"); rhythmic modulation builds hush without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but figurative overload ("sunrise caught in glass," "ship of glass over thought") in most sentences dulls peak vial-burst propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in silence motifs ("vaulting hush," "swelled") penalize without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gondola voyage into lyric silence-craft with prism/storm glass ingenuity; risk-taking in patterned hush elevates stakes toward charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
