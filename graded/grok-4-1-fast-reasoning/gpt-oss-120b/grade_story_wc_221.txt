<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to navigate loss via ritual is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like stepping closer, with embodied emotions in compass warmth; earned change to pilgrimage feels credible. Lacks sharply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal sketching beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sketch alignments and glimpse build density to CR closure (true north reconfiguration with blank-map cost legible in "promise... even if the world remained a blank map"). Orientation anchored instantly; single scene with next-anniversary deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deck's temporal stretch constrains glimpse action and enables bridge, charging final glow; compass as recurring micro-setting pulses in alignment with sketch, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selectivity (violet ash, charcoal scent) biases via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (direction amid vacuum) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via line-compass alignment and glimpse deepening knowledge/options. Agency in pressing charcoal/stepping shows trade-off cost felt in fading vision; pressure coheres to charged poise at pilgrimage resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-exploration emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted in final map-of-possibilities image without moralizing. Resonance in ancestors' echo offers non-literal answer to navigation question, embracing ambiguity of shifted north.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature (taffy time, comet tail) modulating rhythm under reflective pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged final pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (river of light, pliable canvas) coherent and purposeful, varying rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in vibration/pulse phrasing (-0.3) but pattern supports accumulative texture without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi time-deck with ancestral ritual transforms post-apocalypse trope via inward compass pivot; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
