<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in fragment and joy is consistent and compels painting choices, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete yet leans epiphanic without strong embodied conflict, as in "true power of her craft was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from fragment glow to mural expansion and fog thinning; closure as CR lands on-page with conceptual cost in "fresco fragment's exposed film dissolve into the night, its essence mingling with starlight," reweighting ruin to hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog-shrouded orchard anchors early and constrains via mist-cloaked passersby stopping to watch; charges final image as "fog finally thinned, the orchard's trees caught the reflected glow, trembling like chandeliers."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy tightens accumulatively through mural growth and passersby reactions; one deepening in fog thinning forces stance crystallization with felt cost of shared light slivers carried away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of light reviving sorrow emerges organically from painting acts and visitor responses; resonant non-literal answer in orchard humming with optimism, but borders echo in final whisper "May we always find joy where shadows once held sway."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of light/glow biases; rhythmic modulation supports build, as in "each brushstroke was a pulse of photon-kissed pigment."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density purposeful in accumulative style but risks overwrite in sustained metaphors; paraphrase loops on "pensive mirth" (repeated thrice) and orchard transformation dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting via network in fog ruin transforms revival trope; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in fragment-to-dissolution arc.</comment>
