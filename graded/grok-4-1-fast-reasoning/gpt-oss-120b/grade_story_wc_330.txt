<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to interpret silence drives consistent micro-choices like placing the halo and singing, with embodied persistence in her kneeling and descent; final realization earned via prior repairs. Minor slip in abstract epiphanies like "understood that the silent carousel... was meant to translate absence," diluting interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: song swells density from gears shivering to cavern choir, culminating in CR where halo on mirror births symphony from void, with conceptual cost of reshaping silence legible in "stitching the broken silence." Orientation anchored early in train and oasis; one tightening via map suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (soot-gray wood, brass lilies, mirror cavern) mirrors internal hush via POV bias; train's ribs and floorboards constrain discovery, charging descent. Recurring wind bells evolve causally, guiding choices without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret silence) signaled early, escalates texturally via song's chain to voices weaving light, narrowing to endurance in descent; agency in repair and placement forecloses void with felt persistence cost. Abstract stakes limit visceral tightening, no live option foreclosure at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from song motifs shifting to symphony; final CR reweights premise without moralizing, resonant in "tapestry of sound" image inviting ambiguity on void's price. Particulars like halo avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased to hush/glow (e.g., "glowed faintly, casting a whispering gleam"); rhythmic modulation builds under song's swell. No dialogue; compression purposeful in mist patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("silence... possibility" restates 4x; "whispering gleam"/"misting hush" churn synonyms across beats) and purple overwriting dull closure image, with mixed metaphors like "wind bells chimed inside the chime"; −1.7 artifacts pervade final third, capping propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay into silence-song conduit via halo/carpenter; halo's evolution from eye-shard to mirror-beacon transforms tropes organically, risking lyric hush for resonant CR without gimmick.</comment>
