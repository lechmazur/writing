<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eliam's meditative drive roots motivation in consistent observation, culminating in earned carving choice with felt weight of grief; interiority concrete in chest-settling calm but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as butterfly/ribbon patterns densify to CR closure in "flowing tapestry" realization and monument carving, with ribbon heart as legible cost image; orientation anchored early in greenhouse intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse's cracked panes and arches constrain retracing and spiral-building, charging final banners; selective sensory details like jasmine-metallic tang filter through Eliam's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map grief signaled early, escalates via accumulative spiral growth and migration waves narrowing to heart-shaped deepening; agency in marking stones forecloses scar-view with basin-carving cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief-as-tapestry theme emerges organically from ribbon/butterfly/stone particulars, resonating in monument's rain-gliding heart without statement; final villager gathering offers non-literal answer via shared hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent meditative perceptual signature in pattern-noticing diction; stable third-limited POV with no head-hopping, but elevated register occasionally drifts from carver's lexicon in peak realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative language in most sentences dulls propulsion during accumulation (e.g., "shivered stone," "thundering calm" strings violate density check); minor paraphrase loops in grief descriptors reduce clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterflies/ribbons mapping intangible grief transforms trope into inevitable heart-monument; risk in spectral guide heightens meditative stakes without gimmick.</comment>
