<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find deleted memories roots deeply in her habits and haunts, compelling micro-choices like pressing the wildflower; embodied emotions shine in the "tug in her bones." Lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance earns closure change. Final gathering of memories shows credible renunciation of loss with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coffee spirals build density to chamber revelation and CR closure where memories emerge as "minnows in a moonlit tide," reweighting deletion premise with whale's echoed song as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors immediately in dock/whale. Single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt chamber and gravity pockets constrain entry and reaching ("pulling at boots and lanterns"), charging final image as walls "hum" and steady. Sensory details (salt kiss, wildflower scent) filter through Mara's priorities, mirroring internal tug. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate deleted memories) signaled early, tightens via coffee pattern to slab unlock, narrowing options under gravity pressure; agency in exhuming/extracting forecloses ignorance with felt reclamation cost. Escalation coheres accumulatively to charged poise. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed deletion emerges organically from particulars (whale loss, memory minnows), culminating in CR: "deleted memories were not lost, merely compressed," reweighting without moralizing. Final image of whale's song and steady gravity offers resonant answer. Subtext layers in gravity as memory holder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: notices "sifted dreams" in sand, "shy tides of force." Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, consistent lyric compression taught early. No head-hopping; voice embodies Mara's coaxing mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "sand fell away like sifted dreams, revealing a smooth slab"); rhythm varies for ear. Purposeful motif repetition (gravity pockets) taught, but minor figurative density in peak ("filament of light that coiled") risks slight overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale-beached surrealism, coffee-map divination, gravity-stored memories transforms loss tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Particular details (rusted brass, pressed blossoms) feel organic and memorable.</comment>
