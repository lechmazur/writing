<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Traits like "emotionally rational" are labeled without embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses acting in scene; minimal micro-choices under pressure reveal no hierarchy of values with cost, e.g., prizing open mailbox lacks internal tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure at "noble lie dissolve... transparent honesty"; cost legible in transformation felt via retreating ivy and sunlight beam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and station decay constrain actions (rusted mailbox pried) and charge final image (vines retreat, shards dance); sensory details selectively mirror internal parallels without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early with Accumulative deepening via letter's parallels narrowing noble lie's cage; agency in placing letter on pedestal, but abstract stakes lack visceral test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically through station-kingdom parallels, reweighted non-literally at ending image of dissolving lie into honesty; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in compassion-fact coexistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with historian's perceptual signature (cathedral naves in ivy); elevated diction and rhythmic modulation fit voice, modulating to charged poise at climax without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites high-pressure beats (e.g., "silver ink swirling like moonlit water" stacked amid rising glow); minor paraphrase loops on "truth" and "noble lies" dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fictional historian decoding noble lies via decayed station transforms symbolism trope; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
