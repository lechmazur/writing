<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature as noticer with embodied curiosity ("air tasting of brine"); micro-choices like buying/placing shard reveal values; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in hush-placement beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds via shard spread to CR closure ("I realized... hush that would keep beating beneath"); orientation anchored early (pier at dawn); cost legible in "weight of silence settle like dust".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (brine, salty lullaby, wind-sigh); shard as recurring micro-setting constrains observation and charges final pulse image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand/catalyze house life) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as hush syncs houses ("outlines blurring into collective sigh"); agency in shard placement forecloses restless mind with felt alignment cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of vivid hush emerges organically via displaced-object spread, not statement; final shard-heart pulse reweights observation role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent first-person perceptual bias ("houses... breathe with tide"); rhythmic modulation with pressure (short sentences in spread beats); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (shopkeeper's whisper).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density ("hushed blaze", "tiny moon") in most sentences lacks variation, dulling propulsion (−0.7); hush/silence/sigh paraphrase loops across beats (−0.5); pattern serves but obscures peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh shard-of-hush synthesis transforms silence trope into catalytic force; risk in lyric accumulation heightens neighborhood "breath" stakes organically.</comment>
