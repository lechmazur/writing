<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via scar-coffee ring mapping and embodied fog post-anesthesia; motivation intensifies through plant dialogue compelling ritual choice. Final understanding earned via prior micro-choices without unearned epiphany. Minor abstraction in "stories in scars" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring "meteor hush" and image layers to CR closure where hourglass clears, reweighting scars with hope at "light poured in like molten glass." Orientation anchored early in tower at dawn; one tightening via alignment ritual pays cost of patience. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower, tunnel moss/root, and coffee rings constrain choices (descent, examination, placement) and charge final image; sensory selection (damp moss scent, cool stone) reflects fogged urgency. Micro-setting via root/hourglass mirrors internal scar map purposefully. POV bias filters details idiomatically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar stories) signaled early, tightens via plant link and ring pattern narrowing to ritual under Accumulative lens; agency in alignment forecloses doubt with patience cost. Escalation via deepening images culminates legibly. Minor abstractness softens visceral stakes pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wounds holding hope emerges organically from scar-ring-miracle progression; final "stories resolve into a single melody" reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in moss whispers and hourglass avoids moralizing. Resonance from particulars, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic texture ("meteor hush," rustle vibrations); perceptual signature biased toward scar readings selective under fog/stress. Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring hush-to-glow cadence; purposeful "meteor hush" motif avoids loops. Figurative layering coherent in lyric mode but dense in ritual beat ("grains whispered a fragment") borders muddle without obscuring closure. Zero scaffolds; rhythm passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-reading via coffee rings/plants transforms tropes into inevitable CR; bold lyric risks (telepathic moss, displaced miracle) heighten stakes organically. No derivative echoes; particular details like "concentric dark stains" anchor vision authentically.</comment>
