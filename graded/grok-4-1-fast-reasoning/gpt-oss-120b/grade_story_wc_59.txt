<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prince's motivation to reawaken beauty roots in his mechanical upbringing flaw, shown via concrete assembly micro-choices; embodied determination peaks in cradle-building under hypothesizing pressure. Internal conflict between conquest tales and feather whispers acts in scene, earning flaw's melt at hatching. Minor slip in epiphanic phrasing ("purpose that resonated") avoids 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of collection, hypothesizing, and cradle builds to hatching RR with legible cost in redeemed genesis mirroring prince's arc. Orientation anchors prince/palace early; single scene coheres without shards. Closure image of swaying palace reconfigures steel-to-life with felt effort price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stalactites, gears, basalt niche constrain cradle assembly and water stream choice, charging final swaying palace image; sensory hierarchy (iridescent shell vs cold steel) filters via prince's beauty-longing bias. Details evolve causally (pistons ignite with song), mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, tightens via assembly under hypothesizing pressure to hatching cadence shift narrowing mechanical-flaw options. Cost legible in prior effort/strain ("voice trembling like violin string"); agency in cradle forces rebirth trade-off. Enters 8+ as tightening forecloses inaction path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flawed genesis theme emerges via egg-cradle forging beauty from steel/feathers, resonant in phoenix aria reweighting premise without moral state. Final image (gears harmonize birdsong) answers redemption question non-literally; minor "kingdom learned" near-moralizing dings peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (gear-garden contrast) and rhythmic modulation (whispering theories to vibrating walls); diction purposeful in lyric texture. Psychic distance tightens at cracking burst; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shimmering... mock the cold steel" advances setting/stakes), varied rhythm; but figurative overload in climax ("feathered light... collage of ancient colors") muddles via mixed vehicles, docking −0.6. No loops, clean grammar; propulsion fits accumulative rise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phoenix rebirth via gear-cradle in stalactite palace synthesizes mechanical defiance/nature organically, transforming tropes through flawed-genesis calculus; risk in lyric density heightens stakes to quaking harmony image, inevitable in hindsight. 9+ via non-obvious fusion charging closure.</comment>
