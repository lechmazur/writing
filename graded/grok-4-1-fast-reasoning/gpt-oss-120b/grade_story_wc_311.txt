<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to name fears intensifies convincingly through embodied ache and trembling hands; arc from grief to certainty earned by naming sequence, though final epiphany borders tidy without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from page-lift to crystal chants to aurora; CR closure via halo ascent reconfigures sacrifice echo with legible emotional cost in "release from endless mourning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked dome and scattered light constrain crystallization and charge final halo; stone "inhaling" syllables mirrors internal release, with sensory selectivity (amber dusk, humming crystals) vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears escalates accumulatively via melting droplets to aurora; agency in whispering names forecloses nameless terror path with felt cost in pulsing echo's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice as burden-to-bridge emerges organically from naming acts; final boat-constellation image resonantly reweights nameless fears without moralizing, embracing grief's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (breathing stones, pulsing terrors); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, though minor register elevation in epiphanies slightly distances immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density (e.g., "dust motes into tiny prisms") purposeful in lyric mode but overwrites peak naming beats; minor paraphrase loops ("each crystal... each name") dull propulsion without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper naming crystalline sea-monsters transforms sacrifice trope; atlas-to-aurora progression feels inevitable and risks bold lyric ascent without gimmickry.</comment>
