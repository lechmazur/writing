<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Traveler's motivation to map healing via living obituaries is consistent and intensifies through projections, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; micro-choices like kneeling and tracing statues reveal traits under pressure without deeper internal conflict shown in pivotal projection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from whispers to rose revival as Charged Poise closure, legible cost in "work was never finished"; orientation anchored early in garden; vignette progression tightens meaningfully without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's crisp leaves, mossed mosaics, and veined marble constrain projections and charge final image where shadows recede and rose unfurls; sensory details selective via traveler's priorities, evolving causally to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting healing absences signaled early, escalates via deepening projections that narrow to rose waypoint under Accum lens; agency in thread use forecloses isolation with felt cost of endless corridors, though pressure remains atmospheric over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing through explained absences emerges organically from thread-rose revival and garden's breath, offering resonant non-literal answer in final path-following image without moralizing; subtext in lingering blooms reweights loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in geographic metaphors and biased noticing of absences; rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but paraphrase loops in repeated "intimate projection" and "geography of healing" (e.g., three mentions in closing beats) dull propulsion; minor metaphor mix (grapes/vine, bruised violet) and template stems in descriptive runs trigger patterned-artifact penalty without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituarist traveler projecting via thread transforms loss tropes into healing geography; bold lyric risk heightens resonance in rose obituary waypoint without gimmickry.</comment>
