<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to capture the dream roots in craft traits, shown through embodied breathing and anchoring amid melting world; micro-choices like aligning sextant and deeper inhales compel escalation. Interiority concrete via fog in lungs and feet in earth, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal breathing cycles for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via breathing cycles to dream pull-in, landing Charged Poise RR at "the mirror’s surface rippled, catching the dream’s flicker," with legible cost in grounding as world melts. Single scene, orientation anchored early in orchard fog; closure reconfigures options with undeniable felt endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and twilight frost constrain choices—curl into lungs for repair, thin to ribbons sealing cracks—charging final lifted veil revealing silver-veined trees. Recurrent glass-mountains motif mirrors internal states through action, selective senses (breath-crystal, rustle) purposeful; body/setting integration elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream capture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sync deepening to sextant straightening and dream coiling; agency in rhythmic exhales narrows options, cost felt in anchoring amid melt at climax. One tightening sufficient, charges final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries-as-shadows emerges organically via verses, breath-weaving, to final "weaving together of separate songs" realization, reweighting premise in orchard's unified breath without statement. Resonant CR in humming portal and ripened scent, lingering ambiguity in ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature in shimmers, sighs, pulses; rhythmic prose modulates with breathing intensity, diction poetic yet grounded in craft lexicon. No head-hopping or elision issues; texture distinct and pressure-heightening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm matching breaths, varied syntax propels; minor figurative density in peak ("fog thinning to silver ribbons") coherent via motif-teaching, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Glass-mountains recurrence pattern-taught, avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-craft, breath-fog repair, dream-ivy capture transforms fantasy tropes via specific orchard logic; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in final portal hum (+0.3 risk).</comment>
