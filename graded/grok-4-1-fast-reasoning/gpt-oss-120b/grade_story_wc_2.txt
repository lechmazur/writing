<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's restless mind and relic obsession drive consistent micro-choices like improvising the leaf test and trusting the needle, earning her harmony; embodied emotions in "heart beating in time with the drip-drip rhythm" ground internal conflict. Minor slip: epiphanic realization at inscription feels slightly unearned without more contradictory impulses in the cavern beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from greenhouse test to fissure discovery and CR closure in new clock creation; cost legible in "plans were fragile constructs." Orientation anchored early in tunnels/workbench; one tightening via needle's decisive swing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae, ozone mist, and etched stones constrain path (fissure slip) and charge final image of waterfall-rhythm clock; sensory hierarchy (water roar, drip-drip) reflects tinker's priorities. Vivid, purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriending uncertainty via compass) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through leaf swirl → tunnel → inscription, narrowing to improvisation trade-off; agency in placing compass on brazier forecloses rigid planning. Cost felt in resolved "harmony she had never known," but lacks sharper visible price in pivotal cavern beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty guiding invention emerges organically from compass metaphor, leaf swirls, and waterfall rhythm reweighting plans. Inscription line ("When the tides of certainty wane...") is thematic echo in climax, flattening subtext with near-moralizing (−0.4).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tinker's perceptual signature in gear/relic whispers and paradoxical phrasing ("uncertainly certain"); rhythmic diction modulates from damp hum to swirling applause. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; motifs like "swirling leaves" integrate without loops. Overwriting in cavern metaphors (silvery sheets, ozone mist) risks muddle in high-pressure beat (−0.5), but pattern-taught and legible at inscription.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer/compass/uncertainty transforms relic-hunt trope into subterranean CR on fragile plans; risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
