<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent traits and micro-choices align with sculptor identity, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal carving beat; final child realization feels declarative without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from visions to sculpture; CR closure lands in child image and "endless tide of learning rise anew," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of perpetual unfinishedness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and driftwood shards constrain carving choices and charge final compass image; sensory hierarchy (grain like stone shifting) reflects sculptor's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining via slide/carving) signaled early, but deepening meditative without narrowing options or trade-off; lacks agency-driven tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of endless learning emerges organically from particulars like scars/driftwood; resonant CR in child boat and layered tableau reanswers premise without literal moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "stone shifting like the grain"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation suits meditative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering risks overwriting in sustained carving beat ("each cut a question, each smooth plane an answer"); minor loops in "reimagine" refrain dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh magic realist synthesis of lantern projections and driftwood as time bridges transforms tropes; turbine hum inflects reverie uniquely without gimmickry.</comment>
