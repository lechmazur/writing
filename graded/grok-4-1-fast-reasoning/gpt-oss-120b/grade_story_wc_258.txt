<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shift from doubt to purpose earned through tape-tracing micro-choices under inherited weight, but embodied contradictions mild and emotions lean abstract over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-tightening via measurements/hum/snap to Charged Poise CR ("no longer a burden but a compass"); cost legible in droplet-reflected universe charging final readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded loft and tape constrain isolation/confiding while droplet on tape charges closure image, with sensory selection (hum, rustle) mirroring perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping post-crash hope) signaled early; accumulative deepening via spiral/snap forecloses doubt with reconfigured options, but internal pressure lacks visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of collapse-to-hope emerges via tape-card symmetries without statement; final image non-literally reweights patterns as lexicon, lingering via ambiguity of "unseen path."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with seer-like perceptual signature (ink-whispers, vein-alignments); rhythmic texture modulates reflection, no leakage despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("confiding," "inherited mystery" x5+, pattern-mapping paraphrases) and figurative density (metaphors in ~90% sentences) dull propulsion, especially final third journal/droplet.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, tape, crypto-collapse into mapping ritual transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
