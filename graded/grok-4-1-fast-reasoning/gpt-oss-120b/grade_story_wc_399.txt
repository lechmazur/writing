<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to preserve wisdom drives consecration and departure with earned devotion; interiority embodied in sensory alignment and peripheral awareness. Contradictory impulses subtle in calm under pressure, but micro-choices reveal values without safety-hedging. Flawless at closure realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from arrival to conjured clearing to star patterns reconfiguring purpose. On-page Charged Poise closure in final breath and footsteps, with conceptual cost of eternal wandering legible in "half-masked but wholly devoted." Orientation anchored early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (sand shifting, pavilion humming, cool shade dome) constrain choices like consecration and mirror Keeper's inner landscape. Kinetic parapet as recurring micro-setting charges clearing beat and final dune paths. POV bias filters desert as patient recorder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom) signaled early post-prophet arrival; textural deepening via parapet shimmer and teaching echo narrows to conduit role. Agency in consecration forecloses passive paths with fragile fire cost. Escalation coherent under lens, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral listening as wisdom conduit emerges from dune echoes and star pulls, not statements. Final image reweights premise: paths resemble footsteps, offering non-literal resonance on tending fire amid ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity in fleeting oasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in whisperfield phrasing and biased noticing (vibrations, subtle shifts). Rhythmic modulation builds intensity without head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, syntax purposeful in poetic runs. Minor "echo" motif repetition taught as pattern, no loops dulling closure; zero artifacts in final beat. Vivid specificity trumps minor figurative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic tropes via kinetic parapet and peripheral awareness transforms desert legend into conduit arc. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes in dune-star reconfiguration; inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
