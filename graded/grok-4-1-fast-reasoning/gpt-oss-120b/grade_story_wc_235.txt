<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via jealousy of past selves anchoring chaotic visions; embodied emotions in trembling hands and aching heart compel writing choice with felt cost of past dissolution. Minor diagnostic labels like "feral nostalgia" slightly abstract epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from grave sight to dream shard to realization; on-page CR closure reinterprets grave as marker for untold stories with conceptual cost of time's deletions legible in final step outside.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (pine sap, firelight flicker, wind hiss) filters through POV urgency; birch bark scroll as micro-setting constrains writing and charges final glowing image, evolving with causal snow melt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill chaos signaled early, tightens via dream reversal (fox dissolves, ambitions to ash) forcing furious writing; cost unmistakable in foreclosed innocence, reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of distilling feral nostalgia emerges organically from scroll, dream fox, and grave reprise; final outdoor soar offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting past dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (wind-carved stories, humming fibers) with rhythmic modulation under stress; stable first-person POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overload in peak dream beat (e.g., "fox made of mist" strings) risks coherence without full pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops on "jaded wonder" dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicler with winged scroll messenger transforms nostalgia trope; risky lyric risk-taking heightens stakes via grave repricing, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
