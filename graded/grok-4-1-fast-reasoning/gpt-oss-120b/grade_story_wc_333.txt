<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation to free trapped idea is clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure; abstract "improbable longing" dominates over concrete internal conflict. No secondary characters, so relationships inapplicable; change feels earned but unparticularized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from nexus to path disorientation to ribbon twist, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when filament blooms with felt resolve cost in "leaving behind the lock of hair." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via star-guided groove suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus and silvered cobblestones constrain path and choices vividly; starlight recurs to charge final image of lingering filament. Sensory selection (wind sigh, pulsing hair) mirrors internal release without overt symbolism; cosmic scale fits tone purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free idea from fear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via disorienting steps to wind-revealed groove, narrowing to ribbon twist with agency and cost in unbinding. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in filament's hopeful words against prior shadows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resolve unlatching fear emerges organically from hair-unbinding to filament bridge, reweighting premise in final image of whispers dissolving doubts without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like fluttering ribbon avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct cosmic perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from unsteady whisper to steady footfall, heightening release. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies with scene urgency, but paraphrase loops ("hush of cosmic possibility," repeated shimmer/glimmer) and dense figuratives in climax ("tapestry woven from forgotten dreams") create minor opacity without obscuring closure. High density advances texture effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith allegory with cosmic hair-unbinding transforms tropes into inevitable CR; bold lyric risk heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry, feeling singular and organic.</comment>
