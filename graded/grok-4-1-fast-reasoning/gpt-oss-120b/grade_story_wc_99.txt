<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tutor's consistent traits (slow speech, patient hands) compel ritual choices that intensify to sensed redemption, embodied in gentle placement and murmured knots. Internal conflict limited to abstract sorrow diffusion without shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final understanding feels earned by prior micro-choices but lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs (tides, lace, cerulean) builds to CR closure where "the color... was not a pigment but a feeling," reweighting premise with island's sorrow loosening as legible cost. Single scene anchored early (rain ceased, knoll); no orientation debt. One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (petrichor, metallic tinkle, moss glow) filter through tutor's biased notice, mirroring internal states and constraining ritual via stone/wind/proximity. Compass as recurring object charges final image. Purposeful post-rain islet evolves subtly with light/tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (diffuse sorrow via color-finding) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through needle quiver/glow/smile to foreclose unrest with felt cost (regret released). Agency in recitation narrows options; one deepening suffices under lens. Minor abstractness dulls visceral price slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-feeling emerges organically from ritual particulars (knots aligning compass hue), resonating in final CR image of sky mirroring "cerulean regret" turned hopeful without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing motifs invites ambiguity; protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (lace/tide metaphors as noticing style) and rhythmic syntax echoing slow cadence; voice modulates poetically. No dialogue. Cross-cap from Q7 debt limits higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops/synonym churn (e.g., repeated "tides of remembrance," "rhythmically placid," "diffusing" across adjacent lines dulls propulsion, obscuring cause-effect in ritual beats). Overwriting with figurative density in most sentences without taught pattern; template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "whispered... murmured"). Closure image intact but momentum drags globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai ritual, lace-instructions, and compass-color premise transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically. No close echoes; specific hue-seeking feels memorable.</comment>
