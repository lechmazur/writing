<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to dissolve boundaries intensifies via aesthetic verses compelling the threshold crossing; embodied tremor reveals character under pressure, but contradictory impulses act more in summary than simultaneous scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through verse-density build to resonant reconfiguration closure ("boundaries dissolve entirely... lake glows amber, defying chill") with conceptual cost of folded prohibitions; single scene oriented early in cobalt atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Humming colonnade and frozen lake constrain recitation choices (pillars shift hue, surface cracks) and charge amber closure image; vivid sensory selectivity reflects poetic POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sacred-boundary dissolution escalates texturally via colonnade response, veil lift, and pulse-steadying, narrowing to stride with legible conceptual cost in defied chill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of artistic freedom vs. sacred prohibition emerges from verse-particulars and environmental mirrors, resonating non-literally in amber-glow defiance without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice modulates rhythm with hush-deepening intensity; consistent aesthetic perceptual signature (air-ribbons, moth-wings) biases details purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "dissolving boundaries" (4+ variants) and "tremor of certainty" (3x exact) create redundancy across beats, dulling propulsion; metaphors dense but avoid muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush and quartz responses synthesize fresh lyric mysticism; bold poetic risk heightens boundary stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
