<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Face-blind trait channels into sky patterns via fractal precision, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like coin-timed layers; final endurance earned through deadline pressure. Minor tidy epiphany ("limits were not walls but thresholds") borders unearned but doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density in painting ritual toward CR closure: mural's shimmer holds as demolition roars, reweighting erasure threat with conceptual cost in final image of sky inhaling. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via morning light firing pigments narrows to final coin press.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bark-lined aisles and leaf-filled windows constrain mural placement and hush pressure; recurring coin as micro-setting charges final spiral indent. Sensory hierarchy (light rhythms over faces) biases via POV, evolving to dust-settled cathedral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sky mural before noon) tightens via coin-guided intervals and light shift, forcing trade-offs in slurry mixing; cost legible in "careful craft could be erased." Agency in endurance forecloses safe's overt use, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of limits-as-thresholds emerges organically from blindness-to-sky pivot and coin rituals, resonating in non-literal final image of intact mural amid fall without moralizing. Counter-reading (erasure inevitability) lingers via fragile curtain hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with fractal perceptual signature (light rhythms, breath echoes); diction modulates from stillness to roar without slippage. Compression taught early pays off in charged final poise image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in hush, longer in process); high density integrates action/image sans loops, though minor "hush"/"breath" echoes border scaffold. No artifacts dull closure's sky inhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist, coin-map safe, tree-cathedral demolition transforms limits trope; coin indent payoff feels inevitable, risking lyric build over plot without gimmick.</comment>
