<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Scribe's introversion and internal conflict with the dream as untamed "bear" drive micro-choices like inscribing numerals, earning the reconciliation with embodied cost in settling "warm ember" in chest. Contradictory impulses act in scene via treating dream as "quiet friend." Minor reflection heaviness tilts present but anchors cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to inscription to chime, culminating in Charged Poise RR where dream shifts from burden to ember with felt emotional cost on page ("no longer a burden but a warm ember"). Single scene oriented early; no causality breaks. Lens taught implicitly via sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains inscription choice and charges final pulse/image; petrichor, rain-scent integrate tactilely via breath/cheek brushes. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gears/rain over people). Recurring stone/crystal evolves with light, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) signaled early, tightens texturally via inscription narrowing abandonment to embrace; agency in "no method" guidance forecloses dismissal path. Cost legible in "bear the weight" endurance. Escalation coheres accumulatively to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-time vs. mechanical emerges organically via numerals as "breaths of love," reweighting premise in non-literal chime/rain echo without moralizing. Final image answers abandonment question resonantly. Subtext in gentle sighs implies resilience cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV with perceptual bias (ticks as heartbeats, rain sync); rhythm modulates from hush to amber glow. No dialogue. Diction purposeful, perceptual signature in gear/rain synesthesia.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (exact repeat of "He recalled the night..." sentence); synonym churn ("excruciatingly gentle" x3, "glacial hush" x2, "petrichor nostalgia" x2) dulls propulsion in inscription beat. Template cadence in stacked metaphors obscures density. Artifacts pervade final third, harming closure image clarity (−1.7).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory-counting clock premise fresh via crystal inscription sans method; transforms abandonment trope through textural bear/dream synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically (+0.3).</comment>
