<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and drives micro-choices like tracing bird spirals; embodied sensations (veins tingling) ground interiority. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: canyon seals language "forever" yet seeds "fragile hymn," legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and echo walls constrain harnessing via pulsing resonance and charge sealing image; sensory details (wingbeats, fissures glowing) selectively mirror texture-to-sound stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens texturally through pattern deepening (diamond cracks, chimes merge); agency in tracing spirals forecloses path with sealed-language cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voicing dying texture emerges organically; final "fragile hymn" seeding wind offers resonant answer reweighting legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to patterns (birds as "punctuation marks"); rhythmic prose modulates from whisper to audible sculpture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image; purposeful echo repetition builds texture without loops, though minor figurative density risks muddle in climax chimes cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy of bird patterns, cursed diamond, and texture-language transforms mystic tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure's inevitability.</comment>
