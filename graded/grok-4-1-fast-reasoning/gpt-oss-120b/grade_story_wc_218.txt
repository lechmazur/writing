<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's brazen calm and systematic motivation drive consistent micro-choices like dawn wiring, earning her endurance against the deadline. Interiority shines in diary entries tying observation to purpose. Minor lack of contradictory impulses shown in scene prevents 9+; no embodied fear of death amid calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diary notes to wiring resonance to orchard's glow, culminating in council's decree lift as Charged Poise with conceptual cost of prior isolation reweighted. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mara, island, six months). Closure cost legible in "the orchard itself had transferred some of its vigor to her."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "chlorophyll clouds" and "mica shimmering" constrain wiring choices and charge final glowing oaks. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's botanical bias. Pillars as micro-setting enable tactics, mirroring harmony theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy deadline via harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through resonance affecting visitors/children, forcing council stance shift. One tightening: wiring hum translates tree sighs, narrowing to interspecies binding. Cost felt in deadline's pulse, visible in her renewed vigor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of binding (wire to wood, root to rock) emerges organically from wiring and pillar response, reweighting premise in final whisper without moralizing. Final image of diary in sanctum offers non-literal resonance on reverence. Complexity in children's belief adding social counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature in botanical textures (bark, vines). Rhythm modulates from calm observation to humming intensity. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in wiring ritual. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("petrified trees," "conductive tendons") in early beats slightly dulls propulsion; no loops touch closure. Clean syntax, specific diction propel to ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of copper as bio-energy conductor transforms eco-allegory into tangible resonance, with wiring payoff inevitable from diary logic. Bold risk in anthropomorphic pillars/trees heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise feels singular.</comment>
