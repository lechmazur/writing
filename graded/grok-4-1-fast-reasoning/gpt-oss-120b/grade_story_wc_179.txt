<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's scheming pacifism motivates the central scheme consistently, with traits shown through her whisper to Kovan, but lacks embodied internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; monks' changes feel summarized rather than earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Mara's plot through monks' touches to wanderer's transformation, with CR closure in final image reweighting cellular memory's promise; one tightening via wanderer reprise lands cost in dissolved anger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian sanctuary and music box constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details like "cool lid" and "pulsing vibration" filter through tactile urgency, mirroring emotional thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of releasing resentment tightens texturally via repeated box interactions narrowing hardened wills; Mara's agency in placement forces transformation with felt cost in Kovan's "unfurled jaw" and wanderer's knelt gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of subtle non-violence emerges organically from box's power and cellular shifts, with final wanderer image offering resonant CR repricing resentment's release without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward "gentle twist of hidden gears"; rhythm modulates from hushed setup to pulsing climax, no head-hopping despite cast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language like "living tapestry of soft, invisible currents" risks overwriting in peak monks' beat, with minor "shifting grace" loops, but propulsion holds via varied rhythm to clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, magic box, and cellular memory transforms tropes into inevitable legend; risk in porous reality shifts heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
