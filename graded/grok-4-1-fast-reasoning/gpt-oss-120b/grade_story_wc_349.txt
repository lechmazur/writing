<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vendor's motive clear and consistent, but lacks concrete interiority or contradictory impulses acting in scene; epiphany at "He understood now" feels unearned without embodied conflict. Child enters late as underdeveloped vessel. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: "the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment when absence is quantified and turned into light," cost legible in "weight of his quest dissolve." Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; one tightening via incision pulse suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly integrated, with shelves rearranging by voids constraining quantification choice and glass branches trembling to charge final image. Sensory glows and hums purposeful, filtered through vendor's priorities; micro-setting like podium and knife guides action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) signaled early, escalates texturally via density increase from counting voids to incision ignition and script chorus, narrowing to realization with agency-driven deepening. Cost felt in dissolved quest weight; single tightening forecloses locator-path option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of quantified absence birthing stories emerges organically from particulars like shards and droplets inking "origin"; final chord and stitched pages offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence into creation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing of glows and voids; voice texture consistent in syntax/rhythm, modulating poetically without head-hopping. Whispered handover natural, subtextual; elisions pattern-taught for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High density but overwriting with figurative language in most sentences of key incision beat ("liquid glow fracturing into shards... knife of light") mixes metaphors and risks muddle; moonlight/silver/droplet synonym churn across beats creates mild loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of library as origin orchard with quantifying absence transforms creation myth tropes through grounded ritual; incision turn feels inevitable from established voids, bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
