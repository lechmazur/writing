<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent (discover trees' witness via dreams), with embodied emotion in "pulse that matched the rhythm of his own sorrow"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal mapping beat, reducing depth of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sorrow/dreams builds via tracing to release; on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration when "last strand dissolved" reconfigures grid/sorrow with felt cost in Eli's eased chest—tightening via rising moon suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stormlit tower and moonlight constrain choices (sextant needs "moonbeams filtered through" to mend/heal), charging final image of "lingering glow in his chest"; selective sensory vividness (groaning floorboards, humming filaments) mirrors internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstruct sorrow-grid) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening density (dream-mapping dims grid, moon intensifies pulse); agency in unspooling forecloses burden with legible cost at "sorrow in his chest ease."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-to-peace emerges organically via dream unspooling and moonlight; final image ("world breathing in quiet relief") offers resonant non-literal answer to mundane miracles without moralizing, reweighting quantified grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (folklore-tinged noticing of "dreams...like half-remembered songs"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in ending, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in deconstruction beat ("each filament...floated upward like a sigh"); minor paraphrase loops on "sorrow" (quantified/ease/lift) accumulate texturally without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow-grid, dream-mapping sextant, and tree-witnessing transforms fantasy tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive feels inevitable, heightening quiet closure stakes.</comment>
