<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anara's sacrifice of youth memory at the unseal compels higher-stakes choice, rooted in insurgent traits and telepathic bond; contradictory impulses surface in elder's warning versus plant whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kite discovery accumulates to script decoding, vapor column, and amber crack with memory sacrifice as legible cost in "offered the recollection of her youth"; single scene anchors orientation early, closure as Charged Poise reconfigures destiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hot springs' steam, basalt, and moss constrain decoding via telepathic plants, charging final vine cradle image; sensory hierarchy reflects Anara's plant bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unseal/evolve tradition tightens via decoding reversal and memory trade-off, escalating density to communal reconfiguration; cost unmistakable in sacrifice foreclosing personal past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final embryo gaze and plant chorus offer resonant answer to tradition-evolution tension, reweighting fear to unity via particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "moss sang back in hushed green whispers," rhythmic modulation peaks at ritual without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak ("amber cracked, a golden light spilled"); figurative layering purposeful without muddle at vapor-to-embryo column.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kite-script as plant-decoding key synthesizes telepathy and destiny organically, transforming insurgency tropes through ritual risk.</comment>
