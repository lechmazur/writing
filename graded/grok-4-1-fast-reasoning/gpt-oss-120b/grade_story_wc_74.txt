<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's methodically hopeful trait consistently motivates persistent painting, earning endurance at closure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions are embodied poetically yet verge on abstract summation rather than crisis-specific degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through painting layers to Jiro's pause and Mara's new canvas; Charged Poise closure reconfigures kindness/memory with felt cost in nightly persistence against smog, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (silver specks dancing, glass-filtered moonlight) selectively constrain via sparks to daydreams and charge final hush; rooftop greenhouse mirrors internal hope vs. smog without static repetition or white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rouse via kindness proofs) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to Jiro's remembrance tightening options; agency in note-leaving/note-reading forecloses anonymity path with legible emotional cost in buried memory resurfacing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resurrected languages/gratitude emerges organically from brushstrokes and Jiro's moment, offering resonant non-literal answer in final canvas silhouette without moralizing; counter-reading of smog's sigh adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (saffron hush, moon-tipped whispers) modulates rhythm under painting pressure; brief Jiro focalization clean, no head-hopping, voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density (metaphors in most sentences, e.g., "gentle tides coaxing a hidden shore") and paraphrase loops ("methodically hopeful" x3, repeated moon/saffron motifs without tightening) dull propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures peak painting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-brush resurrecting lost languages to prove kindness memory transforms artist-stranger trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in final rooftop silhouettes.</comment>
