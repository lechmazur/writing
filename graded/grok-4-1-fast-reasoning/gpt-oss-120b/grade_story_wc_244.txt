<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in jocular traits intensifies to compel retrieval and sharing; strength in micro-choices like absurd summons revealing hierarchy of values, but weakness in told contradictions over embodied internal conflict during ivy-cutting climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from rumor to chime-spreading CR closure; ivy-cutting tightening narrows options with legible cost in reciprocity contract; orientation anchored immediately in station and Lira.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy constrains retrieval via specific pattern, charging final slab revelation; sensory details (warm pebble, soft chime) selective and POV-biased toward logistics harmony; spatial choreography coherent as curtains part to cavity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness cure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via crew contraption to rock-lift reversal changing knowledge; agency in polite summons forecloses hoarding with reciprocity cost felt in onward sending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from invitation exchange and chime ripple, reweighting premise in final notebook record without moralizing; returning ivy motif shifts from neglect to hub, charging CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in jocular logistics lens (broken signals jokes); rhythmic diction modulates from descriptive to chime-propelled cadence; minimal dialogue natural and subtext-driven in caretaker reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("captive star," "rusted hinge") in opening but purposeful for textural lens without muddling closure chime; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon rock empathy network via rumor chains and polite anarchy transforms tropes; risk in absurd logistics crew heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at lantern dispatch.</comment>
