<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through fire-scars and ash-whispers revealing firefighter particularity; motivation to enlighten compels vow at altar. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with "gently skilled" phrasing leaning label-like without micro-choice tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of light/shard motifs to CR closure ("cracked porcelain turned whole... by the collective understanding"), reweighting bargain premise; cost legible in persistent "fire-scarred skin" soothed yet marked. Orientation anchored early; single arc fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlight and ash valley selectively constrain reflection ritual, mirroring internal scars and charging final beacon image; sensory hierarchy firefighter-biased (smoldering ground whispers tree names). Purposeful integration avoids white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate pain via box) signaled early, accumulatively deepens at pulsing box/vow ("offering her a chance to return what she had taken"), narrowing to village sharing with felt paradox cost; mild agency in meditative turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-language emerges organically from shard-lenses and light-rain; final image offers resonant CR repricing bargain without moralizing ("gifting it back through honest reflection"). Complexity lingers in scar-triumph paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scars frame light/pain); rhythmic texture modulates meditative pace. Elevated diction occasionally drifts from rugged firefighter lexicon; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites propulsion across beats ("stars twirling in patient arcs... silver ribbon stitching"), with "hard softness" thrice creating paraphrase loop; strained mixes (shards as lenses/memory) muddle clarity. Rhythm varies but momentum drags in reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh firefighter-porcelain synthesis transforms scar-trope into innocence pact with "hard softness" paradox; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick. Closure reconfiguration feels inevitable from motifs.</comment>
