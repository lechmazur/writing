<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in translating symbols reveals whimsical-empirical traits under pressure; contradictory doubt fuels resolve without tidy resolution. Final endurance of luminous doubt with monsoon cost feels earned. Minor diagnostic labels like "empirically whimsical mind" slightly abstract impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream translations builds to pattern break (tremor, shoot unfurling). Orientation anchored early (Mara, ridge, seed). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in "tiny shoot unfurled... promising rain that would soon test," with legible cost of potential drowning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridge in bloom (jade vines, orchids) filters perception and anchors memory work, constraining translations. Sensory selection (citrus-rain air, lantern hum) purposeful. Final ridge exhale charges closure image, evolving with sprout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken seed before monsoon) signaled early; escalation via intensifying lanterns/translations narrows options under Accumulative lens. Agency in incantation forces stance; cost felt in "drown the fragile shoots."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empirical dreams nurturing memory emerges from symbol translations to sprout. Final image ("weight of impending storm and... lightness of hope") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting doubt as catalyst.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature whimsical-empirical (dreams as weather charts). Rhythmic modulation builds density; purposeful compression in dream mosaic legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (pages turning, petals falling) serve lyric Accumulative mode without muddle. Minor paraphrase in doubt descriptions ("luminous doubt... bright uncertainty"); no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-testing reality checkers and living memory archive; ridge dreams transform tropes organically. Risky lyric closure ("scent of old stories... toward gathering clouds") heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
