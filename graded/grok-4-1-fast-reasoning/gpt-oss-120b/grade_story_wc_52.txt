<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss drives consistent micro-choices like cradling the blank and sealing sap, with embodied grief (hands as newborn memory, steady pulse). Interiority particular via circus lens (lion's roar to sigh), but epiphanic whispers ("loss can be a tool") border unearned. Final endurance of paradox feels causal from prior carving beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (rain beads, steam, sap) tightens to Charged Poise closure in lantern's glow mingling ferocity/calm, with felt cost of acceptance. Single scene oriented early (~50 words: loft, Mara, widow). One deepening via sap emergence reweights stake; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skylight loft, kettle steam, ash grain constrain carving (heat crystallizes sap) and charge final hearth image. Sensory hierarchy (rust-hued glow, whispering grain) POV-biased to loss; rain beads evolve as metronomes mirroring pulse. Micro-setting guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape grief into tool) signaled early; accumulative deepening via sap/steam seals options, forcing renunciation of raw roar for beacon with legible cost (empty space honored). Internal pressure coheres via paradox tension; agency in practical strokes escalates texture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief as shapeable emerges organically from carving/sap vault, culminating in resonant CR: "grief...quiet beacon" reweights paradox without moralizing. Particulars (lion echo, amber sigh) avoid platitudes; final image answers "here and gone" non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in rust-hued/rain metaphors biased to widow's reverence. Rhythm modulates (short boils amid long carves); purposeful compression taught early pays in charged closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (steam veins marking time), but patterned repetition (kettle sings/boils, rust-hued thrice) risks loop in final third, dulling propulsion slightly. Figurative coherent (whip-edge gouge, amber vault), rhythm varies; minor scaffold in repeated "lifted the lantern."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: circus alchemy turns grief into practical lantern via sap-glass method, transforming loss tropes through textured particulars. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically; no template echoes.</comment>
