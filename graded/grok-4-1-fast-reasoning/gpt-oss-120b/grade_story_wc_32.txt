<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in "each ember's sigh as if it were a whispered promise," driving micro-choices like elixir refinements; final placement of crozier earns change from hopelessness with felt perseverance cost. Contradictory resignation/curiosity acts in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterations build density to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (crozier's eruption reconfigures destiny cage). Cost legible in "incomplete; creative destruction demanded further tearing" before final bloom; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains via ash/sparks harvested for elixirs, charging final image where crozier vivifies it; sensory hierarchy (glows, hisses, pulses) reflects alchemist's bias, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to interrupt destiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through elixir tightenings narrowing options; cost unmistakable in shivering wood's faint responses before climax eruption under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically via successive refinements; final "frozen bloom of flame" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting stifling cage, satisfying 9+ test without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "eyes reflecting both resignation and a fragile curiosity"; rhythmic control modulates from hush to thrum, distinct texture taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("pulse" thrice in nexus beats) and motif repetition ("frozen bloom") slightly dull peak without obscuring closure; rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh paradox of "cold to the touch" flame synthesizes alchemy/faith via crozier; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
