<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength in micro-choices during harness revision revealing inventive resolve and muscle memory as embodied trait; motivation to preserve trust drives endurance without strong simultaneous contradictory impulses, limiting depth in pivotal repair beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final descent image, where ongoing burden reconfigures resolve with felt cost; orientation anchored early in arbor climb; single tightening via radio's "Hold fast" legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's branches and vines constrain revision choice and charge final silhouette image; sensory details (moss gleam, leaf confetti) selective and POV-filtered through pattern-seeking, mirroring internal rhythm without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving trust escalates accumulatively through radio silence to repair deepening, narrowing options with burden's fractional lift as visible cost; crew emergence tests endurance coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragile balance under pressure emerges organically from revision acts and soundless echoes, resonant in dawn image reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity in burden's return invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-tracing and rhythmic silences; voice modulates poetically from whisper to hum, consistent under stress without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language ("cathedral of leaves," repeated "echo") in repair beat borders overwriting without obscuring causality (-0.6 for density lacking pattern payoff); rhythm varies but paraphrase loops in "soundless echo" motifs dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud arbor and inventive watcher transforms guardian trope through muscle-memory revision; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in closing silhouette.</comment>
