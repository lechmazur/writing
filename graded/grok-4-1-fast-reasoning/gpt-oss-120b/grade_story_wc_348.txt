<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symphonically minded trait roots motivation in particular interiority; contradictory impulses peak when tracing foam yields insight over lab sterility. Earned change at reed scaffold creation forecloses isolation with emotional cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("loosened grief") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from foam observation to polymer bridge, culminating in Conceptual Repricing via child's chrysalis shell reweighting perpetual cycle with ongoing void cost. Orientation anchors early ("polymer chemist, Mara, stood at the edge"); one tightening at insight suffices. Lens holds cleanly to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam lattice constrain choices (reeds as scaffold, foam guides weaving), charging final glowing bridge image. Sensory hierarchy (rhythmic arches, pop/ripple cadence) reflects symphonic POV bias. Evolving details mirror internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via nature's bridge) signaled early, deepens at foam-tracing insight narrowing options from failure to self-assembly method under accumulative lens. Visible cost in relinquishing lab path felt at "gentle release." Coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of separation-to-connection emerges via particulars (chrysalis void to translucent bridge); final child's shell offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting cycle without moralizing. Subtext in foam's "subtle cadence" layers complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symphonic perceptual signature ("wind's gusts as movements in a grand score") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm with emotional intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction reflects chemist's molecular lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful symphonic metaphors varies rhythm; sentence propulsion aligns with insight build. Minor paraphrase loop on "foam patterns" and "loosened grief" slightly dulls mid-beat momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science and river foam lattice transforms epiphany trope; risk-taking in symphonic lyricism heightens stakes via nature-lab convergence, inevitable in hindsight at bridge's regional application.</comment>
