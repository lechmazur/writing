<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation roots in rebellion shown through humming and drumming micro-choices under lab pressure, embodying contradictory sorrow/hope without labels. Interiority particular via paw taps on reeds/stones, earning change to conduit role. Flaw: epiphany at orb contact slightly unearned, lacking prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via drumming shockwaves lifting memories to Charged Poise closure as protocol shifts post-staff dreams. One tightening (rhythm swells, lagoon mirrors yearning) narrows sterile despair path with felt sorrow cost. Orientation anchors early (Lira on mossy platform, garden scent); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden vividly selective (vibrating blossoms, humming reeds), constraining drumming and charging final orbs/lagoon image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward rhythms/scents; details evolve causally (blossoms to bells). Micro-setting (silver twig, lily) guides perching choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebel sterile lab via drumming for shared dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as shockwaves entwine memories, forcing stance to chorus with sorrow cost exhaled by universe. Agency in paws tapping everything tightens once meaningfully. Visible trade-off: defiance lifts but settles as soft pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow birthing hope emerges organically from auroral veils/orbs, reweighting rebellion without statement; final drumming image answers via non-literal renewal. Subtext in rippling sorrow notes invites ambiguity on despair's lift. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like firefly orbs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing (humming grass, crystal leaves pulse). Voice modulates from swelling to soft cadence under pressure; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short pulses at peak), high density via multi-job lines, but overwriting with figuratives in every swelling beat (auroral hues, luminous bells) risks muddle without stronger pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops (sorrow glow repeated adjacent). Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lab guinea pig with sound wave garden/entangled memories transforms tropes via drumming rebellion; risk-taking in cosmic inhales heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (sterile to collaboration) inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
