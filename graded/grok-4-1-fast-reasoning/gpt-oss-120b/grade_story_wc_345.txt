<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collective villagers and Liora lack contradictory impulses or embodied micro-choices under pressure; traits like altruism told more than shown through scene actions. Old Mara's whisper hints at depth but remains surface-level archetype. No pivotal flaw compounds to charge closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to communal ringing; closure as Charged Poise in "the orchard planet thrummed with a brambled hope," reconfiguring unity with felt endurance cost of ongoing promise. One tightening via gathering to chime suffices. Orientation anchored early in planet/groves/ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches bend and pulse with chime, constraining/urging advance and charging final image. Nebula fireflies/vapor selective and purposeful, mirroring internal calm. Sensory integration vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communal hope amplification signaled early, escalates accumulatively to drop-on-bell reversal narrowing to collective chime. Cost legible in promise to "keep the bell ringing each season." Mild abstractness softens visceral bite at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared sanctuary emerges organically via chalk messages to ringing echo, final nebula glow reweighting strangers-to-family arc without statement. Brambled hope motif shifts from twined hearts to thrumming planet, resonant non-literal close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward singing arches/fireflies; rhythm modulates to chime ripple. Minimal dialogue natural, advances via child's reading. No head-hopping, elision purposeful for fabulist compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "first drop... chime rose, trembling like a heart beat"; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Figuratives coherent, propulsive in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh fabulist synthesis of ghost-chalk rituals on singing-arch orchard transforms unity trope via tactile bell/nebula physics. Risky poetic texture heightens without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight from dawn messages to violet-sky sanctuary.</comment>
