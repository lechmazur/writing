<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied sensations like "heart throbbed like a clock-gear" and micro-choices under pressure (aligning charm with fissure); uncertainty resolves into earned quiet confidence with felt cost of surrendering fear. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies like "understood that to conjure meaning... required surrendering fear," but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through narration stitching light into pockmarks, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "statue’s surface shimmered... sealing the alchemist’s doubts" with legible conceptual cost (surrendered fear reconfigures brokenness). Orientation anchored early in workshop/acid sea; single scene coherent, one tightening via strengthening narrative against churning sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (corrosive mist bite, gears humming lullaby) constrain choices (inhaling mist merges pulses) and charge final image (sea calms, gears settle). Statue's pockmarks as micro-setting mirror internal voids, evolving causally with narration; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure meaning/repair via kintsugi narration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "narrative grew stronger, a bulwark" narrowing options against dissolving sea; agency in persistent narration forecloses doubt-path with visible cost ("surrendering fear"). One deepening sufficient, cost unmistakable in sealed doubts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-to-beauty emerges organically via kintsugi narration and quilting images, reweighting premise in final "world be a tapestry of broken pieces" without overt moralizing; resonant CR in sea's ceasefire. Minor friction from near-explicit declarations like final stanza, but integrated into action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "fragile alloy ready to shatter"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. Whispers function as goal-driven monologue advancing plot/subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (gears/breaths/quilting) propelling accumulative rhythm, varying syntax supports ear-test flow. Minor overwrite in clustered metaphors during peak ("liquid light... sealing doubts") borders coherence but doesn't obscure closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi philosophy in acid-sea alchemy workshop transforms tropes (broken statue mends via story) into inevitable closure image; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, organic to voice/setting.</comment>
