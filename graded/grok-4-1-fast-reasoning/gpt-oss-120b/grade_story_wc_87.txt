<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between buoyed hope and weighted sorrow acts in paddling scene, earning final endurance of regrets as lessons; micro-choices like interpreting compass wobble reveal values. Some over-articulated insights border therapy-speak, e.g., "align heart and action" mantra.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from pier launch to bay glide, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure: compass in palm as "metronome for renewed purpose" with legible cost of lingering regrets. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via steadying needle narrows to acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain course via shadows as beacons when stars hide; water lapping and sunrise rays mirror/charge internal dissolution of sorrow into light, filtering through navigator's bias. Spatial choreography coherent from pier to open bay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome regrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via paddle strokes matching heartbeat and dissolving doubts, forcing endurance with felt cost of regrets as "distant thunder." Agency in riding tide alters tactics under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via acceptance emerges organically from kayak cuts "like pen across paper" drafting narrative; final anchoring image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting regrets as rideable tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of nautical paradoxes (merrily melancholic breeze); rhythm modulates from melancholic to jubilant. Cross-cap from Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "regrets" (tidal wave, backlash, linger like thunder) and "faith" (flickering to steady ember) across beats dull propulsion; metaphor density overwrites without payoff in reflective peaks, e.g., "sorrow dissolve into light, stitching ragged edges."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation metaphors transforming betrayal tropes into inward alignment; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via pole/compass/heart triad, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
