<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Affectionate skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like tracing geode fractures, with embodied emotion in fingertip spikes; final softening earned via process, though slightly label-reliant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns density-build to on-page CR closure in "faint whisper of another mind," with conceptual cost of trust gained legible against prior doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio, geode sliver, and body constrain choices (LED programming, skin mapping) and charge final image of glowing slab; sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rewire brain without drug tightens accumulatively via pulses to whisper confirmation, forcing stance shift with felt cost in softened skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-to-wonder emerges organically via particulars, with willowglass image resonantly repricing premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias to light/fractals stable in single close-POV; rhythmic control heightens resonance under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but minor motif loops (willowglass, somatic markers) and figural density slightly dull peak revelation propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phosphor fractals, geode resonance, and neural mapping transforms tropes into inevitable conceptual payoff.</comment>
