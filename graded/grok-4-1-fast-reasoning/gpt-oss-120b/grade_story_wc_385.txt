<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in haunting curiosity drives micro-choices like singing truths back to stones; embodied emotions via "quiet ache" and "reed's sigh" feel particular. Minor deduction for minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, lacking hairline internal friction in the revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase through layered revelations culminating in CR closure; "revelation struck her with a quiet ache" proves on-page cost as lattice pattern reconfigures echo premise. Orientation anchored early in serpentine nexus; single progression fits scope without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (vibrations in stone/sky, petrichor, quartz light) filters through perceptive POV and constrains choices like placing shell on altar; cavern lattice charges final image. Mirrors melancholy without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo origins) signaled early tightens via progressive deepening to pattern reveal under accumulative lens; agency in singing/placing shell forecloses ignorance with "quiet ache" cost. One decisive intensification suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as untold stories emerges organically from lattice pattern and shell mending, reweighting premise in final hymn without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "every voice... someday be heard."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (subtlest vibrations, syncopation); rhythmic prose modulates poetically under pressure, diction controlled and biased toward auditory melancholy. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (reed/webs taught early); rhythm varies read-aloud without loops, though minor repetitive melancholy phrasing nudges down slightly. Propulsion clear, no scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic quest via perceptive singer and mending shell transforms echo trope into living memories; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
