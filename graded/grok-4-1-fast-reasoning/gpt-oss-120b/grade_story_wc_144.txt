<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blindness trait embodied in sensory cues like vibration and scent drives motivated micro-choices, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to charged poise closure in "each repaired wing was a promise"; cost legible in bell chime signaling endless work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Depot mist and water basin constrain refraction choice and charge final hover image over tracks, mirroring internal states through tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of precise repair signaled early tightens via patch adhesion and hum test under accumulative lens, but lacks reversal narrowing options with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of blind sight bridging broken to horizons emerges organically from repair particulars; final iteration planning offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct blind perceptual signature in sound/touch filters; lyrical rhythm consistent under calm pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels texture; purposeful soft/quiet patterning enhances voice without loops or muddled figures in repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh blind refraction synthesis transforms artisan trope organically; ship's parallel departure adds non-obvious conceptual risk without gimmickry.</comment>
