<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's resourcefulness drives key choices like inserting the phone booth key, earning her endurance at the climax, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or degrading thought under stress, keeping interiority poetic yet surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure at the transmission ripple revising histories ("forcing the indifferent rulers to confront the ghosts"), felt cost in "the battle would be long"; one tightening at platform arrival; orientation anchored early in auric lagoon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choices via puddle reflections guiding to platform and charges final image of key glimmering and whispering waves; sensory hierarchy (ripples catching starlight, molten gold glow) reflects Mara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast truth vs. indifference) signaled early, deepens via key insertion and code whisper narrowing options to persistence; agency in micro-choices forecloses easy silence with cost of prolonged battle legible in "cracks of complacent stone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of persistence rewriting indifference emerges from water-memory images shifting at transmission ("inserting forgotten acts of defiance"); final silhouette offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of liquid reflections and shadows; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overwriting with stacked metaphors and repetitive lagoon/reflection phrasing ("puddle reflections," "reflected map faded," "water itself had become a living chart") creates paraphrase loops dulling climax propulsion; mixed vehicles like "liquid memory" and "echo of footsteps that never happened" verge on muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic rebellion via water as mutable history-map transforms tropes organically; risk in conceptual "revised histories" heightens stakes through irreplaceable lagoon logic.</comment>
