<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion (fever broken, stone in chest) drive micro-choices like smudging ink; meaningful change to outward resolve earned via prior actions. Minor diagnostic tone in "certainty is a brittle leaf" slightly abstracts contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from smudging to barometer adjustment to final reading; CR closure lands on-page ("weight seemed to lift from her chest") with conceptual cost of carrying truth outward. Orientation anchored early (station, post-fever Mirela); pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (console parses ink humidity, barometer trembles) and charges final image (folded paper in wind, traced veins pulse); sensory details selective and POV-biased (chlorophyll tones echo logs). Antennae sway mirrors internal vines purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measure swallowed truth) signaled early, deepens texturally via oracle parsing and needle tremor narrowing perceptual options; cost felt in resolve shifting weight "heavy yet surprisingly light." One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of measurable truth in margins emerges organically from particulars (smudged ink yields humidity gradient matching stone); final image reweights swaying certainties without moralizing. Resonance from conflicted lie/truth interplay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (auroral sorrow veils mind, ink bleeds like station pulse); rhythmic control modulates from fever haze to resolve. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (wind sways antennae like vines advances atmosphere/causality); minor figurative density in reflective beats (auroral sorrow recurs) but pattern coherent, no loops obscuring closure. Rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle measuring psychic weight via smudged botanical data in weather station; risk-taking in lyric method heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight via margins motif.</comment>
