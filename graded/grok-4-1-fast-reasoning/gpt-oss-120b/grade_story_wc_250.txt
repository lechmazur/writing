<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Guardian defined by labels like "silent empathy" and "spiralingly calm" without contradictory impulses or embodied flaws acting in scene; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, rendering motivation archetypal rather than individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Conceptual Repricing in night's grateful response and glowing dock; orientation anchored early, closure cost legible in "patience, a calm as deep as the canal itself."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's slick reflective planks and still canal constrain weaving method and charge final shimmering image; sensory details filtered through guardian's perceptual bias purposefully evolve with ripples.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching darkness escalates via textural density of shutter patterns and cadence shift to slower ripples; agency in mirror alignment forces deepening with patience cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of darkness learning its light emerges implicitly through particulars like water constellations; final fisherman's alignment offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting night's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-person guardian focalization with perceptual signature of spiraling poise; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative texture, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "shutters," "ripple," "silent empathy" across adjacent lines dull density; figurative overwriting pervades without pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion in weaving beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of dental mirror and water shutters transforms teaching allegory into fresh textural weave; non-obvious premise commits fully, risk-taking heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
