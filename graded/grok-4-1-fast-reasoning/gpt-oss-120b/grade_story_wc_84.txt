<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Characterization leans archetypal with Lira's thrill and recognition embodied but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; perpetual surprise noted early feels label-only without constraining a flawed choice. Pilgrim applies mild pressure via chants but relationships don't force a crucible shift. Final vow emerges but without visible internal cost on pivotal lever-pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from star trails to chip's hum; orientation anchors early in observatory at dusk. On-page RR closure at "She pressed a slender lever... frequency... articulate... belonging" reconfigures belonging conceptually with felt unity cost. One tightening via drone alignment suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective with star trails constraining drone path and "brilliant dimness" paradox charging final glow image. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (Lira notices mechanisms humming under boots); evolves causally from dusk to aurora echo. Micro-setting (pedestal, lever) guides climax choice proportionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging frequency) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via trails/mechanisms to lever-pull tightening. Agency in drone guidance and press forecloses inaction path with recognition cost felt at "surge... missing pieces snapping." Mild pressure; no reversal but cadence shift reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from chip awakening and pilgrim chants, resonating via final token glide reweighting scattered pieces without statement. Subtext in collaborative pulse invites ambiguity on unity's cost. No moralizing; final image answers via "frequency... pulse of every living star."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic biases (constellations as "silver threads"); voice lyrical and modulated. Pilgrim murmurs natural/subtextual; no head-hopping. Experimental lyric compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("brilliant dimness" x5, "star trails" x4, "missing pieces" x3) create paraphrase churn in high-density beats, dulling propulsion past midpoint. Overwriting with mixed light/shadow metaphors in climax obscures clean rhythm; density high but scaffold drags final third image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech in ancient mystic observatory transforms belonging trope via frequency chip; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at hum realization. Details particular (copper veins pulsing); no close echoes, bold tonal paradox heightens stakes organically.</comment>
