<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mina's motivation to claim the throne burns consistently, shown through unflinching search; interiority concrete in sensory nostalgia but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, like no hesitation amid "weight of histories tug."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from mural discovery to throne surge as Charged Poise RR, with cost in "time slipped away" and historical weight legible at "forge a bridge of fire"; orientation anchored early in orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy—"fermented jasmine and silicon"—narrows to ascent immediacies, constraining path via fissure and steps; final vista of "neon ruins and blooming data trees" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ascension before sunrise tightens via flake pulses and "every heartbeat echoed," forcing tactic shifts like tracing sigil; cost visible in foreclosed time as throne hum replaces weight.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of past-future balance emerges organically via shifting murals and dual eyes' reflection; final "new ruby flake beside the original" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing of "holographic dew" and "pixelated rain"; rhythmic diction modulates from exploratory to charged summit without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering (e.g., "cascade of pixelated rain") risks muddle in ascent beats with pulsing/humming loops; propulsion dips from synonym churn like repeated "glimmered/glittered," but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cyber-analog synthesis transforms quest trope via data trees and crystal stairs; fresh "paint layers" reveal feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
