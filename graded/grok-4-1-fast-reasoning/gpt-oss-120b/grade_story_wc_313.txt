<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in family legacy drives consistent actions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "precisely humane" feels label-like without embodied tradeoffs in pivotal photo realizations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with photo revelations building density to CR closure; town's response ("dam inside them had cracked open") makes legible cost of healed scar legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ridgeway embankment and reservoir constrain scanning/observation choices; recurring water reflections charge final "glimmered... ancient eye" image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunge myth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via photo trail narrowing to truth; cost felt in "lingering fear... chased away" at communal reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth via stories emerges from photo particulars, reweighted in sunrise image without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable from communal reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to reflective surfaces creates distinct texture; rhythmic modulation supports quiet poise, but elevated diction occasionally clashes with grounded warden role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative language in most sentences (e.g., "hush settle like mirrored glass") dulls revelation beats; repetitive "hush/mirrored/reflect" loops and paraphrase redundancy slow propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh poetic synthesis of photos/memory to rewrite reservoir myth; ridgeway-phone trail inflections feel inevitable from established reflective patterns.</comment>
