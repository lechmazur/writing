<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to forge dawn from shadows roots actions like arranging mirrors and rallying clans; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal rallying beat, rendering visionary idealized without flaws complicating micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from radio snippets to chorus crescendo; closure as charged poise in aurora pulse reconfigures shadows-to-light with conceptual cost legible in "first true sunrise of the new dawn."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains choices (mirrors aligned, coils draped, constellations traced) and charges final glittering roof image; sensory details like ozone/parchment filtered through prophetic bias evolve with storm to support tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens texturally via coils sparking pulse, forcing allegiance crystallization; agency in commissioning drones yields felt cost in ferocious storm yielding to gold clouds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shadows-as-lanterns theme emerges organically from mirrors/coils to aurora reconfiguration; Selene's "covenant" verses verge on thematic echo, slightly muting emergent resonance at climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prophetic perceptual signature (lightning patterns, glimmers) and rhythmic modulation; purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens despite minor syntactic repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("fragmented radio frequencies" ~7x, "unfold/ed" ~6x, "ancient shadows" ~5x) and template cadence in humming/singing sequences dull propulsion; mixed metaphors (storm "drumroll," frequencies "phoenix") obscure crescendo clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-prophecy and shadow-binding tech transforms visionary trope organically; gritty whimsy tone heightens stakes in coils-to-aurora turn without gimmickry.</comment>
