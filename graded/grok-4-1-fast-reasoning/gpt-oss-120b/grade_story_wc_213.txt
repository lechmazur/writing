<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to favor listening over noise roots actions but lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; tester's competence is untroubled, with no blind spots driving mistakes. "Credibly curious nature" reads as label without embodied cost. Smooth purpose confirmation at solstice ceremony feels unearned without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensor data and hush builds to Charged Poise closure at "the bell sang a low, steady tone... visitors fell silent," reconfiguring clamor to understanding with felt cost of silencing old mechanism. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One tightening at zero hour surge suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specificity vivid in "driftwood ribs and glass panes," sensors "along the bell tower’s spine," constraining choices via glue drying and wind pressure thresholds. Setting pressures tactics (microclimate triggers) and charges final dawn hush image. Sensory hierarchy reflects tester's priorities; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful switch for true storm voice) signaled early but escalation mild—waiting for glue and zero hour surge lack agency-driven deepening or visible trade-off narrowing options. Under accumulative lens, density increases but pressure stays meditative, not forcing stance crystallization. Cost (potential sensor wobble) told, not viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from switch and bell's resonant note, with final image of descending staircase offering non-literal answer via "quiet rebellion against... clamor." No moralizing; ambiguity in storm's "true voice" lingers. Recurring hush motif charges closure without token symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sky's "pulse," hush motifs; voice modulates lyrically from anticipatory to confirmatory. Prose texture distinct in rhythm, syntax reflecting tester's patient curiosity. No head-hopping or elision; consistency under low stress ideal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose propulsive with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops in "hush" repetitions ("solstice hush... hush deepen... lingering hush") and "listening over noise" echoes dull density in setup beats. Figurative language coherent ("breath of the clouds") without muddle. High info density overall; no major artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of microclimate sensors in bell tower transforms trope of sanctuary into "beacon for calm in chaos"; risk in poetic compression pays off in charged poise. Premise non-obvious, details particular (conductive filaments, console sync). No derivative echoes; bold lyricism heightens stakes.</comment>
