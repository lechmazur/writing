<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via reverse-aging paradox, compelling trance and grotto entry; interiority concrete in bodily time-reversal sensations. Contradictory impulses (rushing vs. withholding) surface but lean summative rather than simultaneous action. Final realization earned through prior causality, but embodiment borders abstract poetry over raw stress degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripple patterns build density to CR closure ("delayed revelation struck her") reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-mastery. Orientation anchored early (Mira on platform over lake). Single-shard evolution from pond to grotto coherent; no debt as pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pond rings and magnetic hum as micro-settings constrain choices (patterns guide steps to grotto) and charge final vortex image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (researcher's pattern-reading bias); details evolve causally (ripples fade to symbols). No white-room; lived-in tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master delayed revelation to teach vanishing/appearing) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via trance-deepening to grotto surge. Agency in withholding urge narrows options; cost legible in paradox endurance ("withholding all along"). Escalation driven by pattern adherence under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of patient revelation emerges organically via ripple motifs shifting to self-mirror reweighting; final image answers "teach vanishing to appear" non-literally. Subtext in withheld perception avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in curse-as-gift repricing. Resonance from particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable, perceptual signature biased to patterns/magnetism; syntax modulates with trance sway to revelation peak. Single POV clean, no leakage; purposeful compression taught early via pond image pays off. Rhythmic diction suits mystic texture without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density (e.g., "ripples carve concentric patterns... lattice of symbols") borders overwriting in revelation beat, slightly dulling propulsion despite pattern. Minor paraphrase loops (sycamore hush repetitions purposeful but echo). Density high, rhythm varies, no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reverse-aging curse, pond oracles, magnetic future-grotto transforms tropes via paradox logic; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Turn inevitable from established patterns; no derivative templates.</comment>
