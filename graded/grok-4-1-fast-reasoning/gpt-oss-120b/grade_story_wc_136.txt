<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to chart hidden truths clear and intensifies through descent; however, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal choices like daring beyond trusted maps or pressing the sizzling punch, resulting in frictionless competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens inferred early via building imagery holds to CR closure at ledger opening ("pages glowed with maps of thoughts never spoken"), reconfiguring fortress as living archive with felt ongoing cost in "promising to return each hour... to add fresh verses."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vault, mist-shrouded cracks as arrows, and constellations constrain every path choice (tracing groove, unlocking relief/door) and recharge final image of "cracks align like a compass"; sensory bias mapper-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking fortress tightens accumulatively via successive unlocks (doorway, staircase, iron door); agency in kneeling/tracing/presses incurs visible perpetual mission cost charging final promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerges organically from unraveling journey to ledger realization reweighting stone fortress as "living archive of humanity’s hidden narratives," with resonant final image of city-approved cracks answering theme of mapping silent stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with mapper's distinct perceptual signature (lines/arrows/maps everywhere); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully from mist-urged dare to awe-steeped poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel effectively; figurative density overwrites slightly in peak descent ("skeletal fingers," "ivy that seemed to breathe") without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms urban quest trope via pavement-arrow mysticism and thought-map archive into inevitable synthesis; poetic risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
