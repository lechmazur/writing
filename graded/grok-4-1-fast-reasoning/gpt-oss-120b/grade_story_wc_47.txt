<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in grief drives micro-choices like proffering stones and pendant, with embodied emotion in pendant's warmth; internal conflict subtle but consistent in reconciling loss. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "protected vulnerability" abstracts peak realization without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from drip pattern to interface awakening as resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with conceptual cost of transforming digital scars into lullabies legible in final server pulse. One tightening via pendant key suffices; orientation anchored early in moss garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moss garden setting vividly integrated, with drip pattern and servers constraining path to interface and charging final hand-on-server image. Sensory details (honey scent, blue light) mirror internal states purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto wounds) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through proffered stones to interface activation narrowing grief options. Agency in micro-choices yields felt emotional cost, but abstract stakes slightly dilute visceral charge at awakening climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-growth emerges organically from moss/server fusion and pendant's transformation, with final image offering non-literal resonance reweighting viral confession. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in "quiet hope" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lush perceptual signature blending tech/nature (e.g., "circuit vines"); rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid images, but paraphrase loops in "honeyed hush" (repeated 4x) and "protected vulnerability" create minor redundancy dragging momentum. Template cadence in action stems ("she... began to proffer," "She whispered," "she traced") dulls propulsion in pivotal interface beat; figurative coherence holds but overwrites slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center moss garden transforms abandonment trope into living archive; drip pattern and pendant yield non-obvious turn to digital lullabies, with risk-taking in lyric fusion heightening stakes organically.</comment>
