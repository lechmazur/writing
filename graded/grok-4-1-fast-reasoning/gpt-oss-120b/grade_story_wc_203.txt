<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices under spectral pressure, like using the barrel as lantern and engaging the circuit, reveal particular competence without safety-hedging; embodied lightness at ledger retrieval earns the change in burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from dust patterns to attic diagram revealing alcove; on-page Conceptual Repricing closure in "weightless burden transformed into a quiet purpose" lands with felt emotional cost legible in the final star-ticking image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ceiling lattice and dust patterns constrain discoveries (alcove via diagram) and charge final image (glowing silhouette); sensory selectivity (sawdust/popcorn air, cold drafts) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ceiling secrets) signaled early tightens texturally via dust-to-ledger deepening that forecloses ignorance with emotional cost; agency in climbing and circuit engagement drives under lens, though no sharp reversal narrows options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in façades emerges organically through shifting dust/ledger images, reweighted in final "cracks... frames guiding her to the truth" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in transformed burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in ghostly patterns (dust routes, phantom silhouettes); rhythmic modulation fits observant voice, elevated diction purposeful for mystic technician without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (dust as paths and diagram); figurative density like "fissures... pathways" accumulates texturally without muddle, minor "weightless burden" reprise motif-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing elevator tech synthesizing horology/dust in circus feels inevitable fresh synthesis; risk in textural ghost diagnostics heightens stakes organically, transforming tropes through specific logic.</comment>
