<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to encrypt vulnerability feels rooted and intensifies through dance and song, embodied in "pulse echo her own heartbeat"; micro-choices like twirling arms reveal values under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal dance scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern build from dance rhythms to crystal sealing, delivering Charged Poise closure in "lab's collapse felt like a release" with conceptual cost of pact; orientation anchored early in sunken lab, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sunken lab's rusted steel and rising tide constrain choices like sealing door into melody; kelp journal and luminous ink integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, charging final emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating encoded vulnerability tightens via tide pressure and dice response, forcing stance crystallization in song; one deepening in crystal pulse reweights options with felt pact cost, but no live trade-off in climax dance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of calm defiance emerges organically from dance encrypting weakness, resonant in final "world recognize her quiet rebellion" repricing vulnerability without moralizing; counter-readings in persistent flaws linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward rhythms ("braid sang in rhythm"); diction modulates poetically under pressure, perceptual signature in sea-foam ciphers; no head-hopping, elision purposeful for lyric drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in repetitive dance/code motifs ("each pirouette encrypted," "each entry sang") creates paraphrase loops across middle beats, dulling propulsion; mixed metaphors like "altar of hangman's dice" cohere but overstack in peak reveal, obscuring crystal moment slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking as dance in sunken lab transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric compression heightens defiance stakes, inevitable in "dice still sit, waiting for the next dancer."</comment>
