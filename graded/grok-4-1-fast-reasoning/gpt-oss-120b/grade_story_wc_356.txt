<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in Lira's planting and patience, embodied via pulsing heart and trembling nose at bloom; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, making arc feel smooth without genuine struggle. Internal change at "knowing that her ambition... had borne fruit" earned by prior acts but lacks visible cost on flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from planting to bloom across time elisions, with closure as Charged Poise in flower's eruption reconfiguring serenity stake with patience cost legible in "stretched across seasons." Orientation anchored early in treetop village; one meaningful tightening via shoot's rise narrows to bloom payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy via Lira's olfactory bias detects "faint notes of decay and renewal" shaping progress tracking; birch trunk and canopy constrain planting site and mirror internal states through swaying "slow, deliberate dance." Recurring scents charge final bloom image, integrating purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to cultivate serenity tightens accumulatively via scent shifts and bloom, forcing realization trade-off; agency in whispering soil and doodling alters tactics with time cost felt on-page. Pressure coheres without reversal need, reweighting options at "perfume so potent... trembled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of serenity in motion emerges organically from growth particulars, with final village tribute offering resonant non-literal answer via doodles and legend; lingering ambiguity in "twin roots" avoids tidy moral but repetitive phrasing slightly abstracts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in olfactory details like "earthy musk to... metallic perfume"; rhythmic prose modulates poetically without head-hopping, diction biased to herbalist's senses. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive motifs ("undercurrent of wisdom," "wildflower hush") create paraphrase loops across paragraphs, dulling density; overwriting with stacked metaphors like "perfume of moss and moonlight" in early beats lacks pattern payoff, obscuring propulsion. Closure image remains clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as serenity relic in treetop world with olfactory drive transforms trope via doodling custom; risk in poetic elisions heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable at bloom legend.</comment>
