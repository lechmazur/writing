<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to free unused love intensifies credibly through embodied breath choices syncing with the tear, earning the final release. Interiority feels particular in lines like "grief could taste like iron," avoiding stock phrasing. Minor slip: legend recall borders unearned summary before pivotal alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as breath density builds map to tunnel to lattice release; closure RR via "surge of warm light erupted, spilling out... coating the blossoms," with felt cost in synchronized effort. Single scene oriented early (viaduct, Milo, twilight). No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (jasmine air, silver pollen, violet mist) filter through Milo's spiritual lens, constraining choices like tile alignment and fog response. Viaduct arches charge final image of light spilling through them. Micro-setting (cracked tile, lens) enables tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free unused love) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as breaths slow/sharpen map/node/tunnel, narrowing to filament release with agency and visible cost in pulsing sync. Climax surge forecloses reservoir seal. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's lattice emerges organically via breath/listening progression, culminating in resonant CR: "healing was not a single act but a continual revealing through breathing changes," reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image of glowing blossoms answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV, with perceptual signature of synesthetic spiritual noticing (breath hues, singing stars). Rhythm modulates from anticipatory to hushed closure. Purposeful compression in breath beats taught early, legible at surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in climax ("exhale turned violet... fog curling like sentient blanket... walls woven from threads") mixes vehicles without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops or scaffolds obscure cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious fusion of camera obscura mechanics with Kwan Yin mysticism transforms pilgrimage trope into breath-driven reservoir quest. Risky synesthesia ("breath shift to deeper hue") heightens stakes organically. Fresh angle inevitable in hindsight via sparks motif.</comment>
