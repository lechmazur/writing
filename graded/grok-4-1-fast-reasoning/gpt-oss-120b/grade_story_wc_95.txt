<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Archetypal figures lack contradictory impulses or embodied emotions; philosopher's mechanical arm whirs but reveals no internal conflict during duel climax. Diplomat's "calm mask" hints at depth but no micro-choices under pressure expose hierarchy of values. Traits feel poetic labels over lived struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: philosopher seals needle card on sundial, reweighting riddle with conceptual cost in "silent geometry of intention." Orientation anchored early in atrium/brook; two shards transition legibly. No causality breaks, but minimal tightening beyond duel rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sundial's coded angles constrain fencing paths and charge final alignment, while brook's settling/rippling rituals pressure start/end. Sensory details (whirring copper, glinting needles) filter through paradoxical attunement. Micro-settings integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (turn questions to destinations) signals early, escalates texturally via duel density and overture amplification, narrowing to shared insight bow. Agency in thrusts/parries, but abstract stakes lack visceral cost until late riddle. One meaningful deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fencing motifs to final map sealing, offering non-literal CR answer to riddle without moralizing. Resonance in needle pins as waypoints recharges particulars. Complexity lingers in "space between fencings" without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward paradox/melody; syntax modulates rhythmically. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression patterned early via overture motif. Elevated diction fits fable tone without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("hidden overture," brook ripple/settle, "dignified chaos") create paraphrase churn across duel beats; simile density overwrites high-pressure clashes without payoff. Template cadence in sequential "he traced... she stepped..." dulls propulsion. Zero artifacts at closure saves from lower band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of idea-duel via mechanical arm, needle card, and sundial geometry transforms tropes into textured fable. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
