<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid prism-mind interiority and motivation to bind combinations compel alignment choice at climax; embodied blaze progression shows change with cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in pivotal symbol alignment reduces depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as doodle motif density builds to cipher reveal and seedling CR closure with tending cost legible in final gathering image. Orientation anchored early in library to grotto; single shard fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Serpentine mist and inverted gravity constrain entry/alignment choices and charge seedling final image. Sensory selection (phosphorescent points, upward water) reflects prism bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bind combinations tightens via inversion deepening that narrows to symbol alignment under Accumulative lens; agency in aligning yields seedling cost of eternal vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from seed motif shift (doodle to lamps) reweighting knowledge balance in final atrium planting without statement. Resonant counter-reading in tending cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical perceptual signature (refracting hues, pulsing lines) modulates with inversion intensity; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in motif compression paid at glyph dissolve.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates action/imagery; minor metaphor density (luminous sparks, blaze furnace) in climax borders overwrite without obscuring closure. Repetitive "luminous" stems deduct lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest with gravity inversion and living seeds transforms trope; glyph-to-seedlings turn inevitable from prior pattern, bold lyric risk heightens resonance.</comment>
