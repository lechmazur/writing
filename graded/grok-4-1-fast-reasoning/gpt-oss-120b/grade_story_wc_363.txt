<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to weave the message intensifies credibly through embodied acceptance of sacrifice settling in her bones; interiority particular via loom-specific perceptions. Final realization of her sacrifice as warp earns change without unearned epiphany. Minor slip in wistful abstraction early, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle pieces accumulate density, each click a beat tightening toward pedestal DC/RR. Orientation anchored early in orchard/bamboo. Closure lands on-page with bead dimming as conceptual cost, reconfiguring silence into hum of hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bamboo/dew/plum blossoms selectively constrain path choices, mirroring internal hush via brushing leaves. Recurring bamboo canopy pierced by thread charges final image. Sensory hierarchy fits loom spinner's tactile bias; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore sound/send message) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puzzle clicks narrowing to pedestal. Agency in placing bead/bead's spend forecloses silence with felt sacrifice cost. One tightening sufficient under lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sacrifice-weaving theme emerges organically from puzzle/thread images shifting to bind worlds. Final dimmed bead/orchard glow offers resonant non-literal answer to silence's unraveling without moralizing. Particulars like amber filament avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in thread/whisper idioms; voice modulates from hush to hum. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping; diction reflects spinner's rhythmic mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short clicks amid lyric swells); high density integrates action/atmosphere. Minor patterned repetition ("stoically sparkling," "raveling silence") serves motif without loop obscuring pedestal peak. No scaffold; propulsion clear to final glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of loom/puzzle/amber as map-messenger transforms silence trope via tactile specificity. Puzzle edges from rummage sale inflect fresh path to sacrifice's warp. Risky lyricism heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
