<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in crafting safe zones compels patient micro-choices like narrating tasks, with embodied emotion in furnace flicker and thawing pulse; internal conflict emerges in abandoning quick safety for slow cooling, earning endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to Charged Poise closure ("the room seemed to breathe with her," reconfiguring abandonment into purpose with patience cost); orientation anchored early (Mara in thawing control room); one meaningful tightening in rejecting quick safety narrows to nurturing equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meltwater pooling like liquid glass and ice percussion constrain patient crafting and charge final kaleidoscope glow; sensory details (furnace flicker, steel table sliver) mirror thawing internal states through goal-directed action; coherent choreography in single space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe zones amid thaw) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via abandoning illusion of control, forcing trade-off of quickness for equilibrium with legible patience cost; agency in vial etching and narration crystallizes stance without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing thaw over control emerges organically from glass/ice motifs shifting to purposeful vessels; final bookmark-as-compass image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in weighty lightness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (veins like glass, labor as liturgy); rhythmic syntax modulates contemplative intensity; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but −0.5 for paraphrase loops (repetitive "thawing heart" and "weighty lightness" across beats without fresh pressure) and template cadence in narrated actions ("I lift... I breathe"); metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower in climate relic crafting metaphorical safe zones transforms trope via poetic accumulation; risk in lyric mode heightens thawing resonance without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from bookmark reprise.</comment>
