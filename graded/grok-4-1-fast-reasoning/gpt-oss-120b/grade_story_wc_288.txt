<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final vow at summit reads as unearned epiphany without micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion present but therapy-adjacent in "brittle awakenings not failures but delicate beginnings."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ritual to song to ascent; closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "independence forged from isolation" at summit; orientation anchored early in tidal library and Mira's goal; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stone circle and sundial constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory details selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states via hum vibrations and cloud tides; spatial choreography coherent through aisles to summit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early and tightens texturally via library song and climb; agency in placing sundial forecloses solitary path with felt cost in "brittle awakening of confidence"; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges organically from ritual images shifting to collective heartbeat; final sundial placement offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing; earned via particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in reverent, mystical noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from description to charged ascent; purposeful poetic compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting via stacked metaphors (clouds as tide/sea/ink) and repetitive "hum"/reflect phrasing create paraphrase loops dulling peak density; figurative muddle in "photon a mirror to countless fragile awakenings" violates logic slightly; rhythm varies but scaffold in redundant motif echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of sky-whale memory and tidal library transforms tropes into organic premise; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
