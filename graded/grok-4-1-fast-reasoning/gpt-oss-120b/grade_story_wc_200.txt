<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to collect souls intensifies credibly through embodied listening and the tooth's resonance, with micro-choices like pressing the relic and telling the joke revealing values under spectral pressure. Interiority concrete but leans poetic over deeply contradictory impulses, avoiding full 9+ test. Final purpose realization earned by prior pursuit without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density of voices and notes builds to RR closure in tooth's glow and healed spirits, with legible cost in Mara's softened ache crystallized in final image. Orientation anchored early (Mara, gorge, sunrise). Single scene tightens meaningfully via joke's transformation without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gorge's slick stones, echoing water, and harp notes constrain pursuit and coax confessions, charging climax when tooth presses wall. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant reflects Mara's goal; sunrise evolution mirrors transformation. Micro-setting (tooth as recurring object) qualifies for 9+ test payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal souls via confessions/laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening voices to agency-driven joke that forecloses sorrow with visible cost (shadows scatter, ache softens). Pressure coheres without reversals needed; single tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of laughter mending grief emerges organically from particulars (goat joke scatters shadows, spirits twirl as fireflies), reweighting confessions in resonant final image without moralizing. Subtext in "luminous ache" motif charges closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sound-biased noticing; lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, syntax poetic yet legible under pressure. No dialogue to judge; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overwriting (e.g., "fragile thread of pain that shimmered like sunrise glass") pervades descriptive beats, mixing metaphors without full coherence penalty to closure. Minor loops ("luminous ache" reprise purposeful but borders redundancy); rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting via harp-guided pursuit and goat-joke climax transforms folklore tropes through gorge's acoustics and tooth's resonance, risking lyrical fantasy without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
