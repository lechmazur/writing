<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frugal traits root motivation and compel schematic precision under cosmic pressure; irony embodies via grain-to-heavens parallel, earning reverent return. Mild internal contradiction limits depth—no blind spots compound into pivotal altar mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from discovery to third-watch alignment, delivering Charged Poise closure ("air shivered... gentle click") with humility cost legible in tile's hum. Orientation anchors early (Nabu, palace dusk); single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust-laden archives and crumbling balconies constrain secret rite, filtering through astronomer's bias; altar tile as micro-setting charges violet glow image, mirroring internal spirals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal covenant) signaled early, accumulatively tightens via planetary alignment under regime interlude pressure; agency peaks in final line-trace, foreclosing unsecured life with felt humility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Math-myth devotion emerges organically via tile schematics, reweighting irony in glyph charts without statement; final prosperity seep offers resonant CR to empirical harmony question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with star-frugal perceptual signature ("lean as his pantry"); rhythmic texture modulates to hum/click climax, but elevated diction drifts slightly from lived humility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("empirically ironic" near-verbatim twice; "dusky harmony" 5x) and dense figuration (every climax sentence) dull propulsion, touching altar peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magic square as celestial pact synthesizer transforms Babylonian relic trope via frugal schematics; risk in lyric accumulative rite yields inevitable cosmic ledger bridge.</comment>
