<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Trait labels like "orderly intuitive mind" and "dual allegiance" motivate summary actions but lack embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no simultaneous impulses shown in pivotal reorganization beat, reducing to archetypal summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of symbols building to community reconfiguration) holds with clear orientation by paragraph 1 and Charged Poise closure in phoenix mural postponing privatization; outline-like "discovery therefore action" sequencing lacks scene pressure, but causal chain intact without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Raft city's flickering lights, creaking hulls, and graffiti walls selectively constrain choices (e.g., pier chip as map anchor, walls for coded symbols) and charge final glass case image; sensory details POV-filtered through Mira's pattern-seeing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reorganization vs. privatization) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via graffiti network tightening artisan/tourist layout; agency in Mira's troupe instruction forces trade-off with felt ongoing cost in "fight had only begun."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of chaos/order balance emerges organically from graffiti blueprint to phoenix rebirth without statement; final image reconfigures dual allegiance tension non-literally, lingering ambiguity on future waves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature (pattern-seeking in festivals/graffiti); rhythmic prose modulates from misty dawn to tide-turning cadence, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies but "hopeful desperation" paraphrase loop (twice, including end) and minor synonym churn in reorganization beats dull density; no major artifacts touch closure phoenix image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft carnival, graffiti codes from stone chip transforms resistance trope; phoenix loop as risk-taking closure heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
