<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to grasp time's texture drives concrete micro-choices like scouring ads and uncovering the hourglass, earning her fulfillment with embodied craving satisfied in the map's revelation. Interiority particular through sensory metaphors like "minutes stretching like thin silk." Contradictory impulses subtle but present in borrowed-time tension against discovery urge; change credible without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer density from urn fragment to garage ad cipher to hourglass reunion, culminating in Charged Poise CR where map reconfigures time as memory lattice with conceptual cost of shared mending. Orientation anchored early in silo/valley. One tightening via ad phrase suffices; closure legible on-page without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald silo as antenna constrains rediscovery, evolving from dust-laden relic to rippling glow mirroring internal states. Urn fragment and hourglass tactile, handled in goal-directed action; valley map charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward time textures; spatial coherence clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscover capsule before time slips—tightens accumulatively via cipher narrowing to hourglass, forcing micro-choices with deepening knowledge/cost legibility in timeless air peel. Agency in brushing dust, placing fragment; final endurance of borrowed time reweighted by map's promise alters tactics felt in communal notes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of broken time mended by recollection emerges organically from garage ad lattice to villager notes, final tapestry image offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in ordinary relics carrying secrets; ambiguity lingers in future inhalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in time-as-texture noticing (silk strands, silver sand stars). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compression purposeful for accumulative density; no dialogue, no head-hopping. Diction character-bound to timekeeper idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in discovery beats; minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("liquid glass," "tapestry") risks coherence without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel, but occasional synonym churn in time descriptors dulls slightly. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of garage sale ciphers embedding time coordinates transforms trope of hidden messages into textural chronicle; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable urn-hourglass click. Non-obvious premise inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
