<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent reverence and sensory embodiment (pressure wave brushing skin) root motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final alignment feels declarative rather than micro-choice tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from arrowhead placement to birds' spirals and echo return, landing Charged Poise closure in final glide and inward gaze; conceptual cost of stillness legibly reconfigures navigation in "slipped into silence, leaving only the pulse’s faint whisper."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring arrowhead and canyon (bone towers channeling echoes) constrain appraisal and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (tactile waves, auditory thrum) reflects POV attunement without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate unmoving) tightens texturally via birds' patterns forming compass, forcing endurance in stillness; cost felt in "weathered resolve settle into her marrow" as pulse wanders on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of continuity in stillness emerges organically from pulse/echo images shifting to internal map; final "canyon seemed less a trap and more a teacher" resonates without moralizing, reweighting reverence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as heartbeats/wind); rhythmic lyric syntax modulates to charged poise at end without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops on "pulse"/"echo" (e.g., repeated thrum/resonance) slightly dull mid-beats without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic reverence with textural navigation (birds as living compass via arrowhead); bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming stillness trope.</comment>
