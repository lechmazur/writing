<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in orderly traits drives decoding ritual to transformation, with micro-choices like prodding soil earning change. Lacks deeper internal contradiction or embodied struggle at pivotal deciphering ("eyes now reflecting the mossy delight"), feeling more declarative than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to CR in final mist-sealing pact, with cost legible in "steady rebirth, each revelation carving a new facet." One tightening via spring discovery narrows to renewal prophecy; orientation anchored early in arbor and Lira's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rustle of leaves, moonstone shimmer) filter through Lira's pattern-seeking bias, constraining choices like prodding moss to reveal pool. Arbor setting charges final cascade of scripted leaves; recurring leaves/monuments mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding leaves) signaled early tightens via ignition and spring discovery under Accumulative lens, forcing trade-off in soul-carving transformation. Agency in building/prodding shows coherent pressure; cost felt in "visible cost on the page" via enhanced senses syncing with forest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordered care unlocking forest memory emerges organically from rituals and final pact image, reweighting human-forest bridge without moralizing. Resonance in leaf-dissolving mist answers renewal prophecy; ambiguity lingers in seasonal riddles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in leaves/seeds) and lyrical rhythm modulating from hush to sigh; purposeful compression in ritual beats legible under lens. No head-hopping; diction biased to arboreal imagery sustains texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel accumulative beats, but minor paraphrase loops ("tiny monuments... each tribute," "transformed always... steady rebirth") and dense metaphors ("leaves like ancient verses") slightly dull climax ignition without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore decoding via seeds/leaves in skyborne arbor feels inevitable, transforming ritual trope through moonstone mechanics and pact closure; risk in lyric prophecy heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
