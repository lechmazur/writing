<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to debunk conspiracies drives consistent actions like sorting fragments, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or visible internal costs in pivotal assembly beat; competence dominates without blind spots compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from collecting fragments to map assembly to diamond discovery; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page when radiation dissolves after placing diamond, with felt world-shift cost in orchard's pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Irradiated fruit glowing and dust storms constrain navigation and assembly under lantern; recurring orchard trees charge final shimmering image, mirroring internal clarity shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover stillpoint tightens causally via reassembly reversal narrowing to tree location; agency in patient reconstruction forecloses brute force path, but storm pressure feels abstract without tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth blooming from lies emerges via diamond inscription and stillpoint realization, reweighting curse premise; direct quote "Only in stillness does the truth shine brighter than any lie" borders on overt statement in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward clues like ink hues; rhythmic diction modulates from wandering to intense lantern work, maintaining perceptual signature without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "comfortable lies" and "stillpoint" repetitions across paragraphs dull density; minor template cadence in "Mira [action]" stems in assembly beat, but rhythm varies overall without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reassembling corporate memos as map in irradiated orchard transforms post-apoc tropes via debunker lens; fresh synthesis of curse-as-smokescreen and mental stillpoint feels inevitable from early fragments.</comment>
