<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation pulses vividly in "vibration thrumming through the marrow of her bones," rooting pursuit of home's shape in embodied loss, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during painful remembering, making closure endurance feel observational rather than earned through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as feather-brushing density builds to new corridor discovery and CR closure ("home... a resonance that could be summoned"), with legible cost in "image shattered like glass into shards of doubt"; orientation anchored early in bookstore labyrinth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mountain's "labyrinthine" aisles erase home's outline, constraining Lira's path and charging final image where labyrinth "breathed with her"; sensory hierarchy (pine resin, old ink) selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (home's shape) signaled early tightens texturally via "pressed the feather deeper" reversal, forcing confrontation with pain's cost that narrows options to alignment; agency in discovery forecloses doubt with felt price on shattered image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of home as "melody... even in the silence of daylight" emerges organically from feather/stone particulars, offering resonant CR without moralizing; subtext in "maps of feeling" lingers via ambiguity of fixed vs. summoned shelter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in metallic reflections and textural notices ("grain shift under her fingertips"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hum's "resonated through the mountain’s stone ribs," no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering ("pulsed with the rhythm of distant thunder") overwrites revelation beat slightly, risking coherence amid high density, but rhythm varies and propels to closure image; minor "shape of home" paraphrase loop nudges down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone as "maps of feeling" and feather-texture reading transforms bookstore trope into resonant quest; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in "feather’s texture as her guide" hindsight.</comment>
