<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in purpose to rekindle via songs and window; interiority concrete in memory patchwork settling into mosaic. Minor slip: limited contradictory impulses shown simultaneously, mostly declarative alignment without peak embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: songs→light→trees→spirits→renewal tightens density to Charged Poise closure where memories settle with purpose cost. Single scene anchored early ("alchemical orchard greenhouse"); no orientation debt, lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid/selective: mica window, copper-jasmine bark constrain singing/renewal choices and charge final breathing image. Sensory hierarchy (scents, hums, prismatic light) mirrors urgency; recurring orchard evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light feedback loop and spirit gathering narrowing to night-thinning trade-off. Agency in singing forces renewal; cost legible in restraint release and memory alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of weaving hearts/communities emerges organically from dawns/songs/spirits; final image ("true alchemy... weaving together hearts") reweights premise without stating moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (patchwork minds, woven dawns); voice modulates rhythmically from tending to radiant purpose. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but metaphor density in climax ("ribbons of light... tapestry of twilight and gold") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff (-0.4); minor paraphrase loops on "woven dawns" and "forgotten songs". Rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical orchard/memory portal transforms renewal tropes; mica window/dawns risk bold imagery heightening stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from song-light feedback to heart-weaving CR.</comment>
