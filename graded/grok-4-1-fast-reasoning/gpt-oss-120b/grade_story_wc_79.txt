<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in pattern study compels choices like tracing shell ridges and blowing the whistle, with embodied dread shifting to resolve; internal consistency strong in single-POV arc. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak discovery slightly tempers, but change earned by prior mappings. Final vow reveals values hierarchy with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from shell spirals to mosaic glow to watchers' light, culminating in CR closure ("Mira understood that the expedition had never been lost") with undeniable conceptual cost of city's lost listening. Orientation anchored early in Shellhaven on turtles; one tightening at mosaic suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shell ridges, mosaic shards, and flanks constrain her path through corridors and emergence, charging final image of turtles humming patterns; sensory hierarchy (visual glows, whistle resonance) reflects cartographer's bias. No white-room; details evolve causally with sun position unlocking passage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers via patterns to avert fossilization) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at mosaic decoding narrowing to hidden passage; agency in whistle use and tracing forces trade-off from fear to promise. Cost legible in vow's forever listening, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns weaving lost into living emerges organically from shell script to watchers' waves; final image ("tucks the reed whistle... vowed to keep listening, forever") reconfigures premise non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of spirals/fractals; voice texture lyrical yet controlled, modulating dread to resolve (e.g., "sunwashed dread dissolve into a quiet resolve"). Rhythmic compression heightens discoveries without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful pattern repetition (spirals, glows) taught early; varied syntax propels from nightly whistles to climax wail, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor figurative density in openings (e.g., "molten ribbon") purposeful for tone, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-shell city and fractal shell-language transforms expedition trope into pattern CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with irreplaceable world logic inevitable in hindsight vow.</comment>
