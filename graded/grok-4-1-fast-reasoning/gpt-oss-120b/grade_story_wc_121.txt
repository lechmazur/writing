<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Archetypal gravity defier shows resolve aligning paths but lacks concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final acceptance ("must accept the fracturing") reads as summary epiphany over earned micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density tightening to CR closure; conceptual cost legible in tablet's dissolution and "carry the weight of all his fractured selves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viaduct's phosphorescent rainwater and glow constrain path choices via alignment with resolve; charges final image in "viaduct’s glow shifted into a somber sunrise."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to conquer self deepens texturally via widening timelines and algorithm iterations; agency in resolve forecloses paths with cost felt at "pledging to carry the weight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Paradoxical images like darkening brightness emerge organically to reweight self-mastery; final "every ending is merely a drop waiting to ripple" resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("darkening brightness") and rhythmic syntax modulate with internal pressure; stable single POV enhances mythic intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motif-driven figurative density propels but paraphrase loops in repeated pulse/glow phrasing ("tablet pulsed... glowed brighter") dull momentum; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Procedural generation fused with mythic self-labyrinth transforms tropes; "algorithm rendered a final corridor" feels inevitable and fresh in introspective arc.</comment>
