<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlen's polished calm as inherited trait drives consistent observation and micro-choices, like proposing markers, earning his final renunciation of endless loops with felt legacy cost. Contradictory impulses subtle in watching startup panic without cracking. Interiority concrete, embodied in lantern/storm image; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of rise/fall/markers builds density to CR closure where "circles are not failures but... testing" reweights premise with conceptual cost of transformed legacy in final train scene. Mosaic shards taught early via "when" transitions; orientation anchored by ~100 words. Cost legible in pocketing euros and walking to rewrite map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Circus train as micro-setting constrains marker choices and charges closure image with fluttering notes in wind; dusky light recurs purposefully through POV bias. Sensory hierarchy selective (rusted wagons, faded banners mirror calm). Final amber light spilling through windows recharges prior warehouse dusky harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rerouting dead-end loops) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through startup crash narrowing options to personal realization. Agency in dissuading Maya and enduring fall forces stance crystallization; cost visible in investor flight and whispered doubts. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cycles as tests emerges organically from markers guiding paths, resonant in final "every circuit has an exit... every exit an entrance" without stating moral. Subtext in foreign notes shifting from boundaries to pocketed purpose reweights premise. Complexity lingers in measured hope vs. father's legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of dusky/calm diction; syntax modulates rhythm in reflective peaks. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("even in free-form... safety rails") distinguishes Maya. No head-hopping; voice biased toward steady observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs; high density integrates image/action (yen/peso pinned beside lines). Motif repetition ("polished calm," "dusky") voice-motivated, not looped; minor synonym churn in calm variants purposeful. No filter stacks or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber's son mapping journeys via money markers on circus train transforms tropes of inheritance/cycles. Risky mosaic timeframe heightens inevitability of fall; final euros pocket feels inevitable, charging closure without gimmick.</comment>
