<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Concrete actions like slipping into the crevice reveal adaptive traits under pressure, but unearned epiphanies such as "She understood then" dilute interior contradiction and embodied emotion at pivotal discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns and ledger build density to CR closure in glass singing with survival cost legible in "fire she had survived"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via shard discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns on basalt constrain path choice and charge final image of returning veins echoing rebirth; canyon walls amplify sensory resonance purposefully filtered through artist's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebirth tightens accumulatively through ledger-guided discovery narrowing rebuild options; agency in retracing forces endurance with felt cost of prior fire loss charging kiln scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges organically from frost-shard-glass arc, resonant non-literal answer in "light lingered" reweighting survival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light fracturing, resonances) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation apt; capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("drifting resonance" x3, "steadily adaptive" x2) creates paraphrase loops dulling propulsion in reflective ending beats; overwriting with unchecked figuration (e.g., "black snow") pervades without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frost-led rebirth transforms survival trope into luminous pattern-play; risk in lyric accumulation heightens without gimmick.</comment>
