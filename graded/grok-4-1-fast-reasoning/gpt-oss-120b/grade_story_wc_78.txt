<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in turning obstacles to instruments, rooted in traits like cloud-reading. Lacks embodied contradiction or genuine struggle; prophet's competence shows no micro-choices under visible stress, as in effortless refinements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cloud shifts build density to Charged Poise closure where orchard breathes as one instrument. Cost legible in tightening loops folding echoes; orientation anchored early in floating orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and swaying trees constrain strikes and enable resonance, charging final humming image. Sensory hierarchy via prophet's bias (clouds to sound) vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake in proving resonance signaled early; escalation deepens via syncopated dubs mirroring clouds, narrowing to finale. Opposition abstract (fickle clouds), but agency in mallet strikes forecloses paths with felt refinement cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reshaping hindrances emerges from gnarled branches-to-instruments without statement. Final drifting orchard reweights premise organically, lingering ambiguity in promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibration outlines and cloud scripts. Rhythmic diction modulates intensity, matching prophet's euphonic mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in sound-sea integrations. Repetitive "fractal patterns" and "restless euphony" create minor template cadence in middle beats, dulling propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-dubbing prophet on driftwood orchard transforms mythic tropes; final sea-singing image inevitable from sketched premise.</comment>
