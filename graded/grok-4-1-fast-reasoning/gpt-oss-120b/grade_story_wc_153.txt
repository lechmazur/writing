<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied shard against chest and weight of unsent letters; contradictory impulses in holding vs. evoking shown in first glass placement. Final realization earned through escalating evocations with visible cost of surrender. Minor epiphanic polish borders unearned but ties to shard's warmth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from glass pane to lagoon veil, cadence shifts to emergence with CR closure ("apology had never needed words"). Cost legible in dissolving weight and firefly promise. Orientation anchored early in labyrinth entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove roots and spirits constrain paths/choices (roots parting like hands); recurring shard charges final golden hue image. Sensory hierarchy vivid (ethereal choruses, slick pane) mirrors internal evocation. Choreography coherent across glass to lagoon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release letters) signaled early, deepens via shard placements under moon narrowing to evocation-only truth. Accumulative escalation in spirits' roar and veil lift forces stance crystallization with cost (grief evaporated). Agency in evoking forecloses silence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wordless apology emerges organically from condensation script scattering to firefly promise, reweighting silence. Final image ("fireflies, each a bright promise") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in spirits weaving letters into soil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cryptic perceptual signature (roots as "whispered verses," air as "living hymn"). Rhythmic modulation builds to hum/chorus crescendo; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonlight struck the stone" advances healing/causality/image); rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language pervasive but pattern-taught in lyric mode, coherent without muddle. Minor "fierce tenderness" reprise purposeful, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shard-healing and condensation letters transforms medium trope via mangrove spirits' chorus. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final fireflies inevitable from prior particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
