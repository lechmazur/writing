<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to instill light is consistent and intensifies through vulnerability felt in descent and planting; micro-choices like waiting for petals and using the gauge reveal pragmatic traits. Interiority embodied in "each step exposed her heart yet shielded it," showing contradiction without labels dominating. Flaw of guarded exposure drives the fragile offering at climax, earning peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from hush to glowing vines recoiling darkness. Orientation anchored early (Mara descending stacks to harbor). Closure as RR/Charged Poise in final dawn glow with cost of her promised returns, legible in "vines still glowed, their light a silent promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory harbor (silver ribbons on tide, clinking satchel, wet planks) filters through Mara's priorities, constraining ledge-kneeling and vine-planting. Recurring rosebush and fire escape charge choices and final image. Atmosphere mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, evolving causally to lit alleys.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light vs. dark corners/dread) signaled early, escalates via petal wait and latch click under Accum lens, tightening to vines' unfurling. Agency in circular hands mimicking oars forces trade-off of vulnerability for recoil of darkness. Cost felt in "fragile offering" charging final glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pragmatic nurturing emerges organically from vine-planting into hush/darkness; final image of harbor reflecting her glow reconfigures light-as-care without moralizing. Subtext in photon promise lingers ambiguity of recurring dread. Resonance from particulars like oar-rhythm ties to resilient devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light patterns (argent ribbon, silvered leaves); rhythmic prose modulates wistfully from hush to settled chorus. Voice distinct, lyrical diction purposeful without withholding. No dialogue; compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies poetically but incurs -0.8 for patterned loops ("quivering hush" x3, "rhythm of oars" x3) bordering artifact in mid-section without variation payoff. High density integrates action/image; no filter stacks or muddled metaphors. Propulsion strong to closure despite repetition weighing climax glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener-locksmith in luminous vines transforming harbor hush; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of vulnerability without gimmick. Premise feels inevitable from gauge-to-pod click; no derivative echoes, bold perceptual angle on care.</comment>
