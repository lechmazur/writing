<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to magnify magic is clear but abstract, lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; her "didn't see it coming" realization feels told via epiphany rather than earned struggle. Pilgrim remains passive without status dynamics or crucible interaction. Interiority poetic but not character-particular, trending archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure: final tapestry image reweights unseen forces as promise with conceptual cost of embraced unpredictability. Single scene anchored early (cave, Lira by ~100 words). Loose causality fits lens but no tightening turn narrows options sharply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal cave, shadows, pearl vividly constrain choices (pearl responds to prayer, shadows weave light) and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy musical/tactile, POV-filtered via Lira's pulse-sync. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify magic) signaled early but abstract; textural deepening via pearl tear grants prayer, yet low visceral pressure or agency-driven reversal. Cost felt obliquely in Lira's fire/embrace, but no live option foreclosed sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of amplifying unseen magic emerges organically from images (shadows to ribbons, laughter to droplets), resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity in steady unpredictability lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable, perceptual signature biased to flickering visions/music; rhythmic modulation builds intensity. No dialogue. Purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in every high-pressure beat ("shadows slipping through each other," repeated light weaves) muddles clarity (−0.7); minor paraphrase loops (shadows pulse/dance/weave). Propulsion strong but rhythm varies little.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cave as living instrument transforms magic trope via textural buildup; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
