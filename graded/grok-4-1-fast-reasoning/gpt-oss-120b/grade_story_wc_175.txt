<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in esoteric realist traits drives ritual choices, embodied in trembling hands and whispered promise; lacks deeper internal contradiction beyond reverence, but endurance as guardian earns stasis with felt cost in final knot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from knots to glowing spirals syncing monarchs; closure as Charged Poise in dissolving structures' lingering memory reconfigures fleeting permanence with conceptual cost legible in "outlines remained etched in the memory of the sky."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant grotto and bioluminescent moss constrain ritual via reeds and glow pulsing with flutters; charges final image as sunrise stitches silence into day, mirroring thematic transience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring histories tightens via last monarch's passage forcing final knot; agency in placing wing atop structure forecloses via temporality cost, felt in trembling and dissolution under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories via fleeting signals emerges organically from particulars like moth wing veins in amber; resonant end reweights paradox without moralizing, in Lira as "both anchor and breeze."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in blushing stillness and iridescent details; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, perceptual bias selective to winged travelers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motifs like repeated "blushing stillness," but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., lingering/etched glow) and figurative density slightly dull propulsion in peak ritual without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insect homage in cloud grotto transforms reverent trope via knotted signals mapping wind routes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of transience.</comment>
