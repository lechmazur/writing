<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied ritual actions like inhaling "a breath between storms" and scars' felt transformation; motivation rooted in scars as "runes she had failed to decipher" compels choices. Minor slip in epiphany smoothness, but earned through micro-choices like whispering the rhyme. Final change credible with visible cost of shedding unfinished symbols.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from quill placement to mist embrace, culminating in Charged Poise RR where scars transform with legible emotional cost ("not erased but transformed"). Single scene oriented early; no micro-turns dilute closure. Cost proof: "each scar lift... now a luminous rune of purpose."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonstone tea set and crow quill constrain ritual choices, charging final image as quill writes runes into air. Sensory details (jasmine slowing time, crystal shards singing) selective via rune-scholar POV. Platform's descent mirrors internal renewal, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crystallizing shards and dissolving mist narrowing to stance crystallization. Agency in placing quill and releasing breath forecloses old pain with felt cost. Climax tightening: "scars coalescing into light" reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-stories emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonant in final image of "luminous verses ready to be read." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in transformation's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from healing via superstition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (glyphs humming, breaths pausing time) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from hush to chime. Purposeful repetition ("breath between storms") taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid images like "quill’s feathered plume crystallizes," but minor overwrite in repeated "saturated hush" and breath motifs slightly dulls propulsion without obscuring closure. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops or artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune scars, crystallizing quill, and breath ritual transforms fantasy tropes via specific logic. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes organically. Ingenuity in quill-tea interaction feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
