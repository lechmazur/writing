<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness clear but told via summaries like "He believed that vivifying the Duplicate would restore"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the slice climax, with epiphanies feeling unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore from blade swing to glass crack, fluid release, and numbness surge; on-page DC closure at "numbness cracking like ice under a sunrise" shows felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo vividly anchors with "smooth basalt" and "sea of shifting chronologies," constraining center-cylinder approach; sensory details like "air sang" mirror internal paradox without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vivifying Duplicate amid custody pressure tightens causally via opposites-merge to slice; protagonist agency forecloses numbness path with legible chest surge cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of opposites rebuilding post-ego death emerges via slice action, but final "method was simple yet profound: pair each breath..." articulates thesis, muting resonant image payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of paradoxical fusion; voice modulates poetically ("blade forged from... complementary opposites") without head-hopping, though shouts lack subtext depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density peaks problematically in climax ("slices the glass, the sound slicing through pretense"); "slicing through pretense" loops thrice, with paraphrase redundancy in reflection epiphanies dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paradox blade as conceptual opposites fusing calm/fury offers fresh spin on clone trope, with dojo's history-rewrite synthesizing psych-spiritual sci-fi organically toward charged twin-pulse closure.</comment>
