<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through fragment's pulse to final bridge realization, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; interiority poetic yet borders on unearned epiphany in "I realize that my translation has become that beacon."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of images tightening to CR closure as fragment dissolves into shared memory with conceptual cost of eternal carrying; structure continuous with legible reflection anchors, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting's paintings constrain choices by encoding clues that align fragment's glow, charging final market stretch across centuries; sensory details (ozone, rain, wind) selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock lighthouse memory signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern convergence and chain unfastening that narrows to dissolution cost; agency in studying aligns with lens, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring unseen memories emerges organically from fragment's light spreading and final whisper promise reweighting time as anchors; resonant non-literal answer in balcony image avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of brushstrokes and glows; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable first-person POV suits lyric accumulative mode without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor figurative density in peak (e.g., "stars in a quiet sky") borders overwrite but pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market and memory translation transforms memory tropes through specific pigment maps and dissolving fragment; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes to timeless commitment.</comment>
