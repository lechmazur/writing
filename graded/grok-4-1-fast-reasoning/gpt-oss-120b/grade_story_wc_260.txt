<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to balance self-respect and compassion drives micro-choices like inhaling mist and shedding judgments, with embodied emotion in the "taut string" moment. Internal conflict emerges via contradictory impulses in reconstructing amid betrayal tremors. Some diagnostic phrasing like "fragile convictions wobble like a candle in wind" edges toward stock epiphany without full cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist, shedding, and colors builds to Charged Poise closure in chameleon curling and journal's "river" line, reconfiguring balance with scars' felt cost. Single scene anchored early (workshop, post-con). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and workshop tools constrain choices (vial on warm stone, low table arrangement) and charge final image (mist rolling, stars blinking). Sensory hierarchy via Mara's priorities (humming tools, shifting skin). Recurring mist subtly mirrors shedding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct trust post-con) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shedding layers narrowing to tail reattachment. Agency in gathering/arranging pieces forecloses mistrust path with "scars" cost legible in journal vigilance note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance via shedding emerges organically from particulars (layers of deceit → tail merge), resonant in final "river that must be tended" reweighting static point. Avoids morals, lingers via con scars ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in misty/vivid noticing (skin as "tapestry"). Rhythmic poetic diction modulates but drifts elevated in peak ("shimmering stillness" repetition). No dialogue or head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting with metaphors in most sentences ("trembling comet," repeated "shimmering stillness") muddles high-pressure shedding beat. Paraphrase loops on mist curling/absorbing and balance images dull propulsion. Some template cadence in descriptive stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chameleon healing as trust reconstruction transforms con trope via shedding layers mechanic. Risky lyric poise on mist/animal images feels organic, inevitable in tail merge and journal cadence.</comment>
