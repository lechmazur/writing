<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Teacher's expectantly resigned interiority and micro-choices (coaxing chord, inviting child/veteran) root motivation effectively, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no deep flaws complicate the harmonious resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation in velvet library; closure as Charged Poise in final image of children tracing rosette reconfigures vanishing arts with felt ongoing cost; one tightening via townspeople's loosening tension suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet library's sensory details (old paper/rain smell, whispering shelves) integrate purposefully; zither rosette as micro-setting constrains evocation of melodies and charges final image of children's tracing hands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of braiding voices against hatred signaled early; accumulative deepening via chord-to-choir density loosens shoulders with visible relational cost, narrowing to ongoing crusade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art reclaiming silence emerges organically from subtracting noise and intertwined voices; final rosette reflection offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in sound/silence bias; rhythmic prose modulates from resigned inhale to peaceful hush without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density (golden threads, rusting chains) purposeful in accumulative build but borders overwriting in opening; minor paraphrase loops on "harmony"/"vanishing" dull mid-section propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-reconciliation in library crucible transforms reconciliation trope; zither rosette's evolving glow inflects premise organically toward survival motif.</comment>
