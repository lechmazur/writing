<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between restless curiosity and "cold doubts," embodied in tears at the vision; final reckoning earned by postcard alignment unlocking personal "lingering winter." Mural artist trait shown via "stories of forgotten light" but underused in choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (postcards, glass, flowers) builds to CR closure via vision repricing the "nocturnal secret" with emotional cost (tears tracing cheeks). Orientation anchored early in pavilion; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Etched glass cavity with "tiny lenses like dew" constrains revelation and charges final pavilion reprise; sensory details (incense, vibrating stone) mirror internal hush. Recurrent amber light evolves from pavilion to glass to moon, recharging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (night bloom mystery) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via postcard-to-glass tactic narrowing doubt; agency in alignment yields vision with legible emotional cost (reckoning "own lingering winter"). Minor abstractness before cathedral tightens pressure less sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "quiet dialogue between darkness and light" emerges organically from glass vision and flower pulse matching heartbeat; final image of unfolding petals offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting childhood question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (sepia faces "whispering," etchings "responding"); rhythmic modulation builds to hummed heart in closure. Stable close third-person limited, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "postcards... whispering a different era" advances plot/atmosphere); purposeful lyric repetition of "amber"/"dawning hush" taught early. Minor figurative density overload in opening shadows risks coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postcards as "collective memory" unlocking prismatic garden vision transforms discovery trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
