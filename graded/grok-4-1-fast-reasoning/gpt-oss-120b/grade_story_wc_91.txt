<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority poetic yet abstract without embodied conflict. Final realization feels unearned epiphany, not compelled by micro-choices under pressure. Fisherman adds no crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar to sparks, fisherman coincidence, firefly release toward CR closure in realization of transformation's texture. Orientation anchored early (beach, Mara, jar). Cost conceptual in shifted destiny view, legible in final walk back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: black sand absorbs sparks into "luminous carpet," volcano rumble mirrors internal pulse, constraining jar placement and charging firefly release. Sensory hierarchy (glow, hush, ash) reflects Mara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand transformation) signaled early but pressure low; jar release deepens accumulatively yet no opposition or narrowed options. Coincidences (fisherman, prophecy) complicate serenely without cost-legible trade-off at peak. Climax lacks agency-driven tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of accidental transformation emerges from firefly sparks and prophecy alignment, resonant in final image of "texture woven through every breath." Borders pseudo-profundity in stated realization; earned via particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (hush, glow rhythms); voice modulates subtly with release intensity. Fisherman dialogue natural, subtextual in ancestral reveal advancing prophecy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>High figurative density ("captive constellations," "miniature comet") pervades release beat without payoff, mixing light metaphors; "seemed to" loops dull propulsion. Paraphrase churn on hush/glow in final third touches closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcano beach, firefly prophecy, textural hush transforms coincidence trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in hindsight sky tapestry.</comment>
