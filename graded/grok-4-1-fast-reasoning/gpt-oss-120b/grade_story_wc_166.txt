<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ambition to craft cosmic verse drives embodied dance actions; interiority concrete in skin-tingling passages through gaps. Weakness: minimal contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously, leaning toward epiphanic summaries like "exile could become a bridge."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "ink pulsed like a heartbeat," reconfiguring exile as pilgrimage with conceptual cost in spreading light. Orientation anchored early in garden and Lira's exile; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's pool supplies moonstone speck constraining acquisition; blossoms turning and arches subtly guide dance while charging final image of silver petals. Sensory details (salt, spilled ink moonlight) filtered through Lira's priorities, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to etch verse tightens via gap-slipping deepening options, with agency in dance narrowing to skin-inscription trade-off. Cost legible in "skin tinged with pale light" and exile dissolution; escalation driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of gaps as possibilities emerges organically from particulars like tide rhythms and ink curls, culminating in resonant CR without moralizing. Final image of light carrying stanza reweights elective exile non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in cosmic-sea synesthesia; rhythm modulates from patient observation to pulsing climax. Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "speck melting into ink that glowed"; rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in recurring "obsidian grace" (purposeful for tone) but no loops obscuring closure; purposeful lyric diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dance and skin-rune transforms exile trope into cosmic conduit; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Moonstone ink feels inevitable in hindsight from garden pool seed.</comment>
