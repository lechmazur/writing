<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness is clear and embodied through vibrations felt in marrow and chest, earning the final thaw. Interiority concrete via sensory pulses, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal crank-turn beat. Change credible via prior micro-choices without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reversed vibrations builds to forward-song cadence shift reconfiguring numbness. Single scene oriented by ~50 words (cavern entry, purpose). Closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with felt cost in "frost under a sunrise" dissolution image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Petrified drum skin turntable and damp air swallowing vibrations constrain choices and charge final glow. Sensory focus on felt pulses reflects deaf POV bias perfectly. Subtle mirroring of internal frost via stone pulses elevates without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via backward-to-forward tightening narrowing mute options. Agency in rewinding needle forces felt cost in chest pulses. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mirroring silence for emotional revival emerges organically from vibrations eroding apathy. Final image of glowing filament reweights hush as reflective presence without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer via "quiet promise that emotional numbness can always be rewound."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: vibrations over sound, biased to marrow/chest feels. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in climax ("ribbons... tugged at her marrow") borders overwriting but pattern-taught via hush motif; minor synonym loops on "hush" (4 instances) dull propulsion slightly. Rhythm varies read-aloud, high density advances texture. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf teacher, reverse songs, hush filament transforms silence trope into felt symphony. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight via cavern's breathing spirals.</comment>
