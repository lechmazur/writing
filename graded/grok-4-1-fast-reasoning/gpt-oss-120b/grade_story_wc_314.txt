<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in scholarly-sentimental traits, with embodied surge at shard-to-lips moment earning harmony; minor slip in archetypal epiphany phrasing limits to strong band, but contradictory impulses (precise formulas vs firefly nostalgia) act in ritual choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ritual beats (crystal placement to shard arrangement), with clear orientation by orchard/waterfall intro; closure as Charged Poise in final oak embedding radiates pulse with conceptual cost of logic yielding to awe, legible in "everlasting sunrise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (vapor scent, pulsing cold, amber hiss) filtered through alchemist's priorities integrates into action; orchard constrains ritual circle and charges final oak pulse, satisfying 9+ gate without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony ritual) signaled early tightens accumulatively via starling sync and crystal explosion narrowing to shard integration; agency in channeling and incantation forecloses failure path with felt sentimental cost, but lacks deeper trade-off for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of logic-intuition harmony emerges organically from ritual particulars, with final shard-lip kiss and oak pulse offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise; no moralizing, though minor ambiguity in "promise fulfilled" edges from exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (alchemical nature bias in "feathered scripts" and dew verses); rhythmic modulation builds to closure intensity, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but dense figuratives ("phosphorescent snow," "shattered glass") border overwriting in explosion beat without payoff pattern, docking from high band; no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual with starling algorithms and dew shards transforms tropes organically; starling-to-spiral turn feels inevitable from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
