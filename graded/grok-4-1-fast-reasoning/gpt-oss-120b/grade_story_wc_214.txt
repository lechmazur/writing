<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority abstracts motives via labels like "spiritually curious mind" without embodied conflict or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy, undercutting earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "understanding blossomed like a flower in night"; legible cost in vulnerability-to-strength reconfiguration; orientation anchored early in station description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station and lantern as micro-settings constrain purpose and charge final image ("its amber hue spilled across the stone floor"); sensory details selective and POV-filtered, evolving with internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathizing via star paths tightens accumulatively through tremor response and chord; agency in tracing/whispering forecloses isolation with felt conceptual cost in final dawn image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically via lantern/star motifs shifting from yearning to fire; final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cosmic empathy bias); rhythmic modulation builds meditative pressure without slippage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("flourishing stillness" x4, "hush" echoes) and paraphrase loops in stillness descriptions create patterned artifacts dulling late density; figurative density overwrites closure beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor premise transforms stellar tropes via tactile empathy and lantern conduit; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
