<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Methodical kindness drives consistent actions like caching the fragment, earning her visibility; interiority concrete via pulses and resonances. Minor weakness in abstract epiphany at "rendering herself visible" without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of sensory echoes builds to charged poise closure in blue glow and shimmering presence, with felt cost of lingering shadows/outage legible in final image. Single scene oriented early; one tightening via reel fit surges resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vent, pipes, conduits constrain uncovering and caching; sapphire hush and dawn shafts charge final invitation image. Sensory hierarchy (metallic resonance guiding) reflects Maren's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility via sense memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through fragment pulse to circuit surge narrowing isolation options. Agency in methodical pursuit; outage urgency as live cost alters tactics toward commuters' pause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-surfacing visibility emerges organically from caching and reel resonance, answered non-literally in shimmering promise without moralizing. Final image reweights hush as beacon with lingering shadow cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush/pulse diction; rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise. Purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action; varied rhythm propels to glow surge. Patterned "sapphire hush" recurrence (5x) borders loop but teaches lyric texture without obscuring closure; minor paraphrase in echoing motifs ("pulse," "resonance").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl-space archivist caching electromagnetic grief-memories transforms library trope; reel-circuit visibility feels inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
