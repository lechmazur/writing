<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion like "comforting unease settled like a soft blanket," but abstract motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is told without conflicting impulses in the scout lunge climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain to lantern hurl tightening; Charged Poise closure via watch fob placement and whisper crystallizes truce with uncertainty cost in final pier image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration ("salt and ferment," lock crack) guides choices (shadows for slipping, rope for hurl); rotting pier recurs constraining spatial choreography and charging horizon walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant truce-preservation stake tightens via decoy barrel and scout confrontation, forcing agency in hurl with momentary truce break as felt cost; causal lens escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fragile trust theme emerges organically from thwart and elders' relief, resonant in watch fob's ticking repricing history vs. resolve without moralizing; final whisper-image answers central hush question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("echoed against wooden beams"); rhythmic modulation fits pirate lyricism, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but "comforting unease" loops thrice and "false starts" synonym churn dull minor beats; no closure touch, figurative strain minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh "truce of hush" in moonshine-pirate synthesis transforms tropes; watch fob's evolving pulse inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking lyric tone heightens unease stakes.</comment>
