<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher's motivation clear and consistent, with embodied longing via pulses and vibrations; micro-choices like guided steps and shout align under pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning declarative over dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in vibrations and patterns to RR/Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "dissolve the borders of his own thoughts" and lingering pulse. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rail spike as micro-setting constrains choices (pierces veil, guides steps) and charges final image (etched, placed by water). Sensory integration vivid and purposeful, reflecting POV bias toward sound vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to catch goddess echo signaled early, escalates via pattern break ("when patterns break themselves") and cadence shift to shout-merge under accumulative lens. Agency in lifting spike and chant forecloses trapping for freeing, with felt integration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of freeing echo over trapping emerges organically from particulars like spike-merge and final smile; resonant non-literal answer in "set it free in a song that would forever wander." No moralizing, ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in sonic biases ("vibrate," "hum," "resonance"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; motifs like "feral lullaby" taught early without loop artifacts. Minor fig density in climax ("wounded bird") coherent but borders overwrite; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic surrealism in sound wave garden and spike-guided quest transforms tropes; risk-taking in accumulative lyric heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via pattern breaks.</comment>
