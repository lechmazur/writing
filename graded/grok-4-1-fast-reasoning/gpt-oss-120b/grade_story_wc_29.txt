<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's cautious hope embodied in "delicate balance" of modulation compels interference choice under trickster pressure; internal conflict surfaces in legend recall versus hopeful surge; earned closure via mantle-passing renunciation with felt chart weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pulse density builds to subsonic chorus reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure in campus hum and final tone reweights division with legible cost in "weight of all the charts"; orientation anchored early at radio station vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust-touched charts and console constrain modulation tactics; sensory hum/static/flicker filter through Mara's perceptual bias; station evolves from battlefield to lighthouse, charging final shimmer image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to outwit tricksters tightens via interference morphing false alarm into static; agency in algorithm/transmitter forecloses panic path with community cost; lens escalation via pattern density to shared pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of ingenuity balancing power plays emerges via interference weaving unity; final valley chorus offers resonant non-literal answer to division, reweighting cosmic legend without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in stellar arc waveforms and subsonic undercurrent; rhythmic texture modulates from restless static to steady beat; no dialogue, purposeful poetic compression taught early fits ethereal grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High figurative density ("airwaves split like a mirror," "ethereal grit") in opening risks coherence but patterns toward closure shimmer; minor paraphrase loop in "cautiously hopeful" echoes motif without dulling propulsion; strong density in chart-to-waveform integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cosmic tricksters via subsonic radio transforms folklore into communal tech resistance; fresh synthesis of university strife and stellar pulses feels inevitable in valley chorus risk-taking.</comment>
