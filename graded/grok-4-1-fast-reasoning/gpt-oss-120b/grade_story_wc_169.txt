<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arin's logical dreamer traits drive consistent motivation to decode hope via equations, shown in gathering artisans and recording movements; internal conflict limited to abstract balancing of math/whimsy without embodied contradictory impulses in pivotal balloon releases.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through balloon experiments building density to CR closure ("gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror") with felt cost in communal resolve; orientation anchored early in grotto/gauge setup, one tightening via largest balloon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto vividly sensory (sea-foam columns, reflected light kaleidoscope) constrains balloon ascents and charges final image via revealed carvings echoing spirals; selective details mirror rising optimism without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fix gauge/revitalize hope escalates accumulatively via mini-to-large balloons narrowing to alignment; agency in Arin's experiments forces trade-off with visible effort cost at gauge steadying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope's mathematics emerges organically from art-measurement resonance in balloon patterns; final CR image of sea-carved spirals reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single Arin POV with perceptual signature of mathematical whimsy; rhythmic modulation suits serene buildup, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops on "trial balloons" (5+ uses), "patterns," "equations" create paraphrase churn dulling mid-experiment density; figurative density overwrites peak (largest balloon) without payoff, obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of balloon math, hope currents, parallel timelines transforms whimsy tropes into inevitable CR; risk in poetic premise heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
