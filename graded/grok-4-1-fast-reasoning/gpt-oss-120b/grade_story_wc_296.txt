<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Druid's guarded trait compels concrete micro-choices like clenching the pulsing seed and whispering to sate its hunger, rooting motivation in uncanny lost-thing affinity; final heart-unbending earned via shard risk without unearned epiphany. Minor archetypal serenity lacks deeper contradictory impulse in peak chant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds from breath-chant rings to shard-melt surge, delivering Charged Poise RR closure where lake clears with legible cost in seed's inward hunger; orientation anchored early in swamp-lake-vortex. One tightening via expanding rings suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (howling wind, twisting branches, rippling rings) filters through druid's rune-lit urgency, constraining chant tactics as trees bend outward; final mirror image charges closure by contrasting surface/depth. Selective integration avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unbending confession signaled early tightens accumulatively via ring-pull shattering ice into whirling shards, forcing gathering agency with seed-hunger cost; war drum cadence reweights pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hidden-truth theme emerges organically from ice-trapped confession melting into seed-bound guard, reweighted in final lake reflection of subsurface soul-battle; resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing via amulet retrieval image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of nature-blade metaphors modulates rhythmically under ritual stress; no head-hopping or elision, diction consistent in druid's serene idiom. Capped per Q7 line debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting artifact dominates peak chant beat with stacked figures ("ripples outward in perfect rings... gentle force of a war drum's rhythm"), dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on "unbend"/serenity in closing third obscure closure image without pattern teach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-devouring seed ritual amid orchard-vortex transforms druid tropes via circle-unbending mechanics growing inevitably to truth-mirror payoff; risk-taking in poetic compression heightens without gimmick.</comment>
