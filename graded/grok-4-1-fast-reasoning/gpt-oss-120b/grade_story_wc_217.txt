<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear in tending the lagoon via verses and feather, rooted in warmly attentive traits; interiority concrete in seeing ripples as "note missing from an unfinished melody." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no blind spots or flaws complicating choices with visible cost, keeping it strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (ripples, feather, verses) builds to Charged Poise closure in "lagoon glowed faintly, the feather floating like a solitary star," reconfiguring incomplete as thriving with conceptual cost of "honoring the spaces between." Single scene, early orientation, one tightening via gust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon and reeds constrain choices (feather on lily, pebbles in spirals); sensory details selective (iridescent green/amber, amber light on rust) mirror poet's priorities, charge final glowing image. For 9+, recurring lagoon evolves, pressuring harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via gust disruption then feather/verses response, narrowing to endurance of discord; agency in placing feather forecloses flawless mending, cost felt in "gentle rebellion against flawless endings."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incomplete emerges organically from feather, ripples, woven dawns; final image resonantly reweights prior fragments ("dawns are forever woven from fragments") without moralizing. No thematic echo or platitudes; counter-readings in "broken threads" linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature (salt air as "gentle sigh"); diction/rhythm lyrical and biased toward dawn motifs. Minor repetition convergence dulls distinction under peaks, but purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("woven dawns," "burnished hush," "harmonizing discord," "kite string snaps" recur 3-4x each without fresh pressure); overwriting with figurative density in every peak beat (e.g., closure's "solitary star") muddles propulsion. Template cadence in tending descriptions; artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of poet-feather-lagoon transforms nature trope via "drake's tail" magic and incomplete beauty; risk in repetitive motifs heightens textural stakes without gimmickry. Familiar poet-in-nature frame limits to strong.</comment>
