<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to map endless night via silence compels micro-choices like lifting the booklet, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the mapping beat; endurance of obsession feels earned with minimal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from hush to map's growth and dissolution as CR with conceptual cost in impermanence legible in "map dissolve into the very air"; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-tossed fort and sensory details like salt-perfumed pages constrain the hushed mapping act and charge the final turret image, filtering through oracle's tidal bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to chart void signaled early tightens texturally via symbol-unfolding and final question, narrowing to dissolution cost; agency in retelling drives deepening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of knowable endless night emerges organically from silence particulars, reweighted non-literally by map's air-dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with hush-biased perceptual signature and rhythmic hush-modulation maintains tight single POV, teaching poetic compression paid off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm propels but hush/ambered repetitions create paraphrase loops dulling mapping propulsion ("ambered hush" x4, "marbled hush" x3); figurative density risks coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of oracle mapping void via silence booklet transforms mythic tropes, with dissolution CR feeling inevitable; bold textural risk heightens resonance.</comment>
