<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority via tactile wall-tracing and paradox contemplation, with motivation intensifying through patient observations to crystal insertion; embodied emotions in "quiet triumph" feel earned. Mild epiphanic polish in final realization slightly undercuts contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to crystal hum and jar-filling CR, with legible cost in paradox of capture; orientation anchored early in cavern arrival. Single scene causality tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble walls and phosphorescent moss constrain choices via reflection angles, charging final starlit photon dance; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through locksmith's periphery. Environment evolves causally with light return, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harvest echoes tightens accumulatively via angle studies to crystal pulse, narrowing options with patience cost; agency in reverse-engineering forecloses failure path. Escalation coheres under lens, though external pressure mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral listening emerges organically from reflections to "cellar of reason" as library CR, reweighting capture paradox without statement; final journal entry resonates prior particulars. Subtext in light/echo interplay invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with reflective perceptual signature in "thousand tiny mirrors" and light pulses; diction/rhythm modulates poetically yet legibly under pressure. Voice texture distinct, prose as character via locksmith idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like gear-crystal insertion; rhythm varies read-aloud, though minor figurative density in "chorus that seemed to ripple" borders overwrite without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith reversing echo-harvest premise transforms tropes via crystal resonance and jar library; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically. Final sun-arc observation feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
