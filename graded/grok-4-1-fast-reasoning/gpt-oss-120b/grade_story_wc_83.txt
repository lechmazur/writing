<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Embodied grief as "fuel he could not extinguish" evolves credibly to contradictory dread/exhilaration before stepping to fissure; final palm thrust reveals values hierarchy with cost in synaptic merge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from visor calibration to geode glow/fissure surge; CR closure at "unused potential was not a place but a state of being" lands with legible conceptual cost in fracture and clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating observatory's rotors and foundation fissure constrain step to crack and amplify resonance; geode shards as "tiny suns" charge final image, mirroring internal awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hunting potential tightens texturally from probability lattice ripple to energy surge narrowing to internal merge; cost unmistakable in "bleakness of his loss melted" with foreclosed external hunt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of awakening emerges organically from hunt particulars, reweighted at realization unused potential is "state of being"; final shard pulse offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature blends scientific (perturbation lattice) and mystic (crystal hum as second heartbeat); rhythmic modulation fits pressure but minor repetition converges texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pervasive loops in "unused potential" (4x), "unfiltered awakening" (3x), and metaphor density overload climax ("blossom... tide... tiny suns") dull propulsion; template cadence in repetitive phrasing obscures surge beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone grief, quantum perturbation hunt, and geode awakening transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in intangibly tangible lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
