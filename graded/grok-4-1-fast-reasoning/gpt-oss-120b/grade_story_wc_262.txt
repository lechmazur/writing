<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in quest for unused love intensifies through psychometry and humming, with embodied emotion in heart-filling; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat, tilting toward mythic abstraction over flawed struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from film tracing to compartment reveal to melting frames; CR closure lands on-page in whispered goodbye and freed love with felt cost of personal emptiness filled, constraints like booth walls shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth's velvet, dust, and humming walls constrain choices (vibrations reveal box) and charge final image (lens as telescope surveying emotions); selective sensory hierarchy reflects gazer's psychic urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love signaled early tightens accumulatively via humming-forced compartment reveal narrowing visionary options; agency in psychometry/reading drives escalation, climax cost legible in cascading love filling her chambers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming unsent sorrow into released love emerges organically from letter-reading and frame-melting; final image of lantern-carried love offers resonant CR reweighting gathering/incubation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of synesthetic mapping (frames as labyrinths); rhythmic modulation under pressure consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but figurative overload ("liquid light pooled like river," "rooms opening into galaxies") in climax risks coherence without pattern-teaching, minor repetition of "thunderous hush" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on film strip unlocking psychic love-vault in booth transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk-taking in spatial expansion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
