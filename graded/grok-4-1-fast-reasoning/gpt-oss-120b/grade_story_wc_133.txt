<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to thresh meaning clear and painterly-rooted, intensifying to exchange; embodied awe at brooch touch shows particularity. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, making final surrender feel resolute over earned struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density of rain trails builds to convergence CR, reweighting meaning with legible cost of surrendered canvases in "exchange fulfilled" beat. Orientation anchored early in island/Mara intro; single scene progression coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory selection (algae slip, salt-slick stones) filters via painterly POV, constraining trail-follow to pool; final mist "varnish" on cliffs charges closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning from grief) signaled early, tightens texturally via brooch/exchange narrowing options to trade canvases; agency in altar placement forecloses path with felt cost under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of art-from-ruin emerges implicitly via grief-pigments to convergence ribbon image, reweighting exchange without moral; resonance in "island had given her meaning, and she had given it art" lingers complexly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature (colors refusing sleep, rain whispers); voice rhythm modulates intensity to charged poise at hum/tremble, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmos; varied syntax propels to climax. Figurative stack in convergence ("spiraling upward in a thin column... coalescing into a single, trembling note") overwrites peak slightly, bordering coherence dip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars mist-survival, painterly mythos, brooch-convergence transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens renewal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
