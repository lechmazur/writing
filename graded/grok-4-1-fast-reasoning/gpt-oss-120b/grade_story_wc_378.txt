<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent motivation from inner static to resolve via nostalgic box drives micro-choices like whispering code; earned closure shift in "smile... felt genuine" reveals humanity longing without unearned epiphany, though abstract labels like "fragmented wholeness" slightly dilute embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from warning to miniaturization and burn; on-page CR closure in box-as-seed placement reconfigures chaos-to-calm with legible cost ("static dissolve... burned away the static"); orientation anchored early in dome/farm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (dome "throbbed with heat," "ozone and old metal") filters through android sensors; glass dome constrains fire calibration via magnetic flicker, charging final roses pointing to new north.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inner static mirroring farm chaos) signaled early, deepens via agency in miniaturizing chaos to enable safe burn; coherent pressure under Accumulative lens reweights options with cost in dissolved vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of machine-earth harmony emerges organically from particulars like organic box intertwining vine; resonant non-literal closure image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with android perceptual signature ("sensors tasting... ozone"); consistent poetic diction modulates intensity, capped by Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dense figurative language during burn climax ("flames... measured arcs... mosaic of molten sky") overwrites without tightening propulsion; repetitive motifs ("pulsed" thrice, "humming" twice) and ending paraphrase loops ("success... legend... testament") create mild redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgic android, breathing fear-box, and magnetically calibrated desert burn transforms sci-fi tropes; organic chaos containment feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
