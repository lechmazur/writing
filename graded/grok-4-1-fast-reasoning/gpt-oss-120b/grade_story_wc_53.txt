<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, like aligning seashells in spiral revealing hierarchy of values; earned change in pact whisper forecloses eroded path with tears as cost. Minor slip in abstract "chronologically confused" label without fully dramatized tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment collection density builds to Charged Poise closure in camera wheel spin and memory exchange, with legible cost in ghost's fading and lagoon's applause. Orientation anchored early on brass platform; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and rusted carousel constrain negotiation via ripples/mist as story carriers and platform as conduit; body/tool (camera wheel) charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (throbbing pulse narrowing to stilled breath) reflects urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost for abandoned path) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via story spiral forcing trade-off; ghost's eye flicker and memory offer as agency-driven deepening with tears as visible cost. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration dilutes visceral peak slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of regret-renewal emerges organically from fragments to sprouting roots in final image, reweighting eroded ambitions without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in ghost's companion fade. Counter-reading plausible in endless collection cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in time-dissonant noticing (birthdays before they happened echoed in future-past rhythm); rhythmic diction modulates from churn to stillness effectively. Whisper dialogue natural, subtext-laden goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm supporting accumulative build, but minor paraphrase loops on "regret" (e.g., "sigh of regret... regrets added weight") and repetitive "eroded" dull closure image slightly; metaphors coherent overall, no muddle in peak wheel spin.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of scavenger-ghost trade in kinetic world transforms tropes via camera wheel as memory conduit; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes to fractured renewal.</comment>
