<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Caretaker's motivation to preserve names roots in consistent systematic traits, compelling endurance of regret with embodied "foxglove regret" pulsing through breaths; internal conflict layers sorrow into purpose via ritual micro-choices. Final renunciation of full resolution (regret returns softer) earns stasis with visible cost. Minor abstraction in emotion labels slightly dilutes embodiment under peak ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds patterns of light/chime/echo, tightening to traveler's arrival as cadence shift reconfiguring isolation into shared memory. Closure as CR in final image—whispering new name joins choir—with legible conceptual cost of cyclic loss ("foxglove regret return"). Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal library, glass orchids, and cracked chime constrain ritual choices (wind crevices trigger song, light refracts through petals) and charge closure image. Sensory details (trembling flame, swirling clouds like parchment) filter through caretaker's priorities, evolving with action. Recurring objects mirror internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names against fade) signaled early; textural escalation via ritual density and traveler break narrows to endurance trade-off. Mild agency in offering orchid forecloses isolation with felt cost (regret cycle). Pressure coheres but lacks sharp opposition, keeping below 8-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragile revival emerges organically from ritual particulars, culminating in resonant CR: final whisper reweights loss as generative cycle without moral. Subtext in deserted marvels vibrating implies complexity of extinct feelings blooming. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature—poetic bias toward luminescence, echoes, violet sorrow—modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity. Voice texture controlled via syntax echoing chime's "fractured harmony"; no head-hopping or leakage. Experimental lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in wind slips, longer swells in echoes); high density integrates action/atmosphere without major loops. Minor figurative density ("light traveled upward... soft chorus") risks overwrite in ritual beats but patterns coherently. Slight repetition of "gently systematic" and "cracked" tugs propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of museum of extinct feelings with glass-orchid ritual transforms preservation trope via textural echoes and cyclic regret. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes of memory's void without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
