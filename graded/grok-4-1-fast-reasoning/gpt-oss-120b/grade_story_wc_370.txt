<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Recluse's compassion and empathy drive entry and admission to curator, earning chamber access with felt cost of confronting abandonment; contradictory impulses in pacing ("staying while leaving") act in scene. Interiority concrete in sensory tugs like "tide" and "creak as chorus," but epiphanies like "every mistake held a lesson" verge on unearned abstraction, softening final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: invitation anchors who/where/when early, density builds via paradox images to CR closure in mirror reflection and smoothed invitation glowing with conceptual cost of carried grief. Dreamlike attic-to-library transition legible as metaphorical "hatch" opening; no orientation debt, lens unambiguous at ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains: attic hatch portals to library "stitched between shadows and sunlight," market façade hides it, shelves "curve like riverbanks" guide to alcove; recurring invitation handled tactilely charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (creaks urge, fog tranquility) mirrors recluse's priorities; evolves causally from rain-damp to sunrise dissolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth wisdom in mistake) signaled via invitation, tightens accumulatively to curator question and mirror reversal narrowing denial options; agency in admitting error forecloses hiding path with grief cost legible in "carrying grief into world." Pressure coheres texturally without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom-in-mistake emerges organically from paradox nest to mirror self-reflection reweighting premise; final "paradoxes nestled safely within his heart" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in curator's "admitting error is key" layers complexity via ambiguity of library's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in biased noticing (cobblestones "whisper," shelves "breathe"); rhythmic control modulates from humid urgency to charged poise, with purposeful compression in surreal transitions. Brief curator dialogue natural/subtextual, advances stakes cleanly; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sigil of owl perched on spiral" anchors plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud via fragment bursts in pacing. Overwriting drag from figurative density ("ink smeared like secret sigh," "tranquility like fog") in opening beats without pattern payoff mutes early propulsion, but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of secret-library trope via nested paradoxes as lived dimension ("silence hidden in plain sight"), riskily surreal transitions heighten stakes organically; final heart-nestling reconfigures invitation's promise inevitably from particulars, transforming abandonment into compassion without hedging.</comment>
