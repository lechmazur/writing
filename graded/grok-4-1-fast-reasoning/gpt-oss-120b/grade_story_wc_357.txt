<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving probe deployment and release; actions reveal competence under inversion pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene or embodied emotional cost to discovery; interiority leans external and observational.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in "resilience was a rhythm she could now hear and guide," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of cultural listening over artifact. Orientation anchored early in planet/canopy details; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward river constrain navigation ("slipped through a gap where the river ran upward"), charging final basin release; sensory hierarchy (phosphorescence, hum) mirrors urgency. Vivid, POV-filtered without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early; tightening via probe chime and growth demonstration narrows to realization, with agency in handling tip. Under lens, density cadence reweights; felt cost in renouncing artifact for broader practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from echo/listening vs. artifact, resonant in final image of dissolving tip and humming orchard without moralizing. Particulars like spiraling vines shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in endless cycles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual bias toward water glints and echoes; rhythmic prose modulates with inversion hush. No dialogue; diction controlled, lyric compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; motifs like "whirling silence" purposeful without loop excess. Minor density ding for sustained figuratives in descriptive peaks, but coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity orchards and star-metal catalyst transforms tropes; risk in lyric sci-fi world logic heightens stakes without gimmick. Premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
