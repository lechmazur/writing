<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in storm-recording traits compel the tube-sending choice; final realization earned via prior lateral advice. Minor slip: low contradictory impulses limit peak complexity, but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from quarantine ripple to shaft discovery; Charged Poise closure in "meticulous nature...compass" reconfigures isolation with legible conceptual cost of shut doors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting (fountain shaft, balcony tube) constrains delivery choice and charges final sanctuary image; sensory details (bruised violet sky, humming air) filter through POV bias without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver truth past quarantine) signaled early, tightens texturally via intuition/shaft deepening that forecloses direct routes; agency in slipping tube shows visible isolation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of lateral integrity emerges organically from tube-to-shaft arc and final "truth would always find a way" image, reweighting quarantine premise without moralizing; resonant but borders overt in vow to cat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as pulses, wind shifts) and rhythmic poetic texture stable in single POV; no head-hopping, compression apt for lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("layered tranquility" x3, "deepen/ed" x4 in closing) and paraphrase redundancy in final two paras dull propulsion; heavy metaphors throughout risk overwrite, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm recorder profession and lateral smuggling in quarantine transforms isolation trope; courtyard sanctuary with pigeon tube feels inevitable and riskily poetic.</comment>
