<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's defiance drives painting and poetry under rising echo pressure, with embodied emotion in heart rhythm and dust-settling cost; internal conflict subtle in softened spirit. Lio adds minor curiosity pressure. Weakness: abstract epiphanies like "price settle like dust" lean diagnostic over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry and mural beats densify echoes toward Charged Poise closure where spire glows after refracted truths, with conceptual cost of self-offered loss legible in final image. Single scene oriented early (canyon, spire by para 1). No orientation debt; one tightening via louder sessions suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain poetry/painting choices, channeling verses to spire; mist and spire charge final glow image. Sensory hierarchy (auditory echoes over visual) fits urgency; details evolve causally (towers resonate, tremble). 9+ test met: setting shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness price) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via chant-to-mural deepening that forces self-confession trade-off. Agency in Mara's micro-choices narrows to ritual poise; cost visible in "piece of herself." Pivotal mural beat forecloses unburdened path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness price emerges organically via refracted echoes and mural confession, reweighting truth from single to many without statement. Final spire glimmer answers via image, embracing loss ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in canyon's "sigh" response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward light/shards; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to resonant hymn under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (Lio's chant advances echo turn). No head-hopping; voice distinctively poetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but repetitive loops ("refracting"/"shards" x5+, "whisper" x4) create template cadence in peak beats, dulling propulsion (-0.8 artifacts). Mixed metaphors (e.g., "frozen finger" to "shards of glass") strain coherence (-0.4). Closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh refraction/echo mechanic transforms forgiveness trope into art ritual with bone-canyon specificity; bold lyric risk heightens thematic stakes without gimmick. Final "We are the echo" reconfigures organically from particulars.</comment>
