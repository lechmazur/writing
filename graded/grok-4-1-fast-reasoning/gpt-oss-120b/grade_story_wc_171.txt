<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract declarations like "operatively gentle" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; Lira's resolve feels told via epiphanies rather than tested micro-choices under pressure. Chieftains remain generic archetypes without applying immediate pressure. No earned change beyond vague "tear slip down her cheek"; flaws don't complicate pivotal altar moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to ritual closure as Charged Poise (swords on altar reconfiguring war into hope). Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One meaningful deepening via chieftains' softening, with felt cost in laid-down swords; no causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective (fire's amber vs. silver moons, jasmine wind) and integrated into action, with terrace/altar constraining ritual choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's gentle priorities. Altar as micro-setting charges final sword image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure peace) signaled early but lacks agency-driven tightening; chieftains' approach feels accumulative but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces trade-off. Cost legible in swords/grudges but abstract, not viscerally testing commitment at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges organically from ritual images (clipboard amid swords), offering resonant non-literal answer in dawn hymn without moralizing. Subtext in softened armor glances avoids binaries. Repetition of "price of redemption" borders overt but doesn't replace scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (cosmic choreography mirroring heartbeat). Lyrical voice modulates rhythm purposefully, perceptual bias character-specific. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>High figurative density (e.g., "dew... moisten parched hearts") pervades without pattern payoff, creating coherence drag; paraphrase loops on peace motifs ("fragile hope," "lessons"). Template cadence in repetitive poetic stems dulls ritual peak. Some propulsion but overwriting obscures cause/effect in assembly address.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Peace ritual trope transformed mildly via clipboard/swords synthesis, but cosmic dance and negotiator archetype feel familiar without bold inflection. Final dawn reprise freshens slightly, but overall synthesis not inevitable or risky enough for elite venues.</comment>
