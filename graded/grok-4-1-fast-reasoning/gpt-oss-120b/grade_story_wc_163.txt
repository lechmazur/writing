<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to learn belonging's rhythm drives actions consistently, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the chamber scene, making the "She understood then" epiphany feel partially told rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure; feather-to-console ignition deepens texture, with legible conceptual cost in "constellations faded, but the feeling of belonging remained" as dawn forecloses the communion moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective details like bioluminescent walls and coral pedestal guide descent and constrain choices; recurring glass panels mirror internal states, charging the holographic dome climax without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn belonging's rhythm) signaled early tightens via feather placements narrowing to synchrony; time pressure to sunrise forces agency in instrument play, with cost felt in fading holograms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of flowing belonging emerges organically from tidal/star images without statement; final "maps new destinies" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity in transience versus internalization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (constellations in tides) distinct and stable; modulates subtly at dawn, but minor syntactic uniformity softens peak intensity in chamber beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density overwhelms chamber peak ("holographic constellations... mirror of her own curiosity") without breath, dulling propulsion; template cadence in "She [action]... [image]" runs (e.g., pedestal to console) create loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrologer charting underwater tides transforms tropes organically; feather's comet-ash logic feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric communion heightening stakes.</comment>
