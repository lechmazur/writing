<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via calloused hands and scars rippling with tone; motivation rooted in sea memories compels device activation with earned shift in "willingness to hear the quiet places." Minor slip in over-articulated realization ("She realized that to translate silence into music she needed...") borders epiphanic but doesn't flatten closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fork reveal to tone resonating through glass, yielding Charged Poise closure in "the conservatory seemed to exhale, its silence finally turned into song" with legible emotional cost in smoothed scars. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass panes hum and resonate tone, constraining sound propagation and charging closure image of "faint rose veins"; selective sensory filter (frost breath, pulse heat) mirrors survivor's bias. Micro-setting (bench, case) grounds actions; evolves causally warmer with emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence to music) signaled early, tightens texturally at device activation where tone "ripple[s] through her scars," narrowing to endurance with felt cost. Agency in prototype use forecloses raw silence; coherent pressure under lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-endurance emerges via heat-mapped emotions weaving "past storms...into a tapestry of sound," resonant in final pilgrimage image without statement. Subtext in silently expressive case reprise reweights silence; complexity lingers in honored waves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature survivor-tinged ("heavy tide" in chest, sea roar memories); rhythm modulates to peak at "pure tone that resonated through the glass walls." No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fork's polished tine...caught the faintest glimmer" advances setting/action); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwrite in stacked figures ("frozen cathedral," "ghostly harp") during activation but coherent, pattern-taught; no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions to fork transforms survival trope via prototype ingenuity; "unshaken marvels" inflects closure organically from particulars. Risky lyric synthesis feels inevitable, heightening resonance without gimmick.</comment>
