<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via skin absorption and vibrations reveals character-specific perception; motivation to map emotions drives micro-choices like following the melody. Minor slip: epiphany at stillpoint leans toward summary over dramatized contradiction, but prior sensory buildup earns the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from trail notes to crescendo and pure tone; orientation anchored early in forest and abilities. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly on-page at "map of her soul finally complete" with felt cost of dissolved languages into harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring as micro-settings constrain choices via vibrations and glow, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (touch/sound over sight) reflects blind POV bias perfectly. Details evolve causally with her steps, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach stillpoint) signaled early, escalates via melody crescendo narrowing options under accumulative lens; one deepening at pure tone forces entry with embodied cost. Agency in persistent following shows endurance, though external pressure is environmental rather than antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of emotional mapping through feeling emerges organically from sensory particulars and final chord convergence, offering resonant non-literal answer in "quiet blaze of inner light." Subtext in skin languages and forest sighs avoids moralizing; lingering ambiguity on future use enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct tactile/perceptual signature modulates rhythmically; POV stable and biased toward ultrasonic frequencies. Compression and patterned sound imagery taught early, legible at closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm and syntax propel accumulatively without loops, though minor repetition of "sigh" and "quiet blaze" borders ornamental. No artifacts dull closure image; figurative language purposeful in sensory peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sensory cartography and emotional stillpoint transforms fantasy tropes via skin-language absorption; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from ring/forest particulars to soul-map payoff.</comment>
