<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to understand sacred patterns drives precise actions like placing rocks, intensifying against curse's fear; interiority concrete in visions trapping her in loops, embodied in kneeling amid spray. Curse transforms credibly from prison to compass at realization moment. Minor slip: fear vs. resolve not fully simultaneous in peak placement beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rock placement to final red stone touch, igniting flame as RR (Charged Poise) with felt cost in curse's reconfiguration and mantle's weight. Orientation anchored early (Selene at bluff, post-friction world). Single scene coherent; no micro turns deflate closure image of glowing rocks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basalt bluff, tide pools, aurora constrain choices (rocks on ledge, dust in receding pools); painted rocks recur to charge final glowing map image. Sensory vivid/POV-biased: kelp-sheen skin, salt-fire air reflect her pattern-seeking. Environment evolves causally with flame tracing path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness dust for patterns despite curse) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rock sequence to flame ignition narrowing options. Agency in final stone placement forecloses doubt path with legible cost (curse's burden shifts). Pressure coheres texturally; curse complicates but curse-turn pays off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of forging order from chaos emerges via rock spirals bending tide/flame; curse-to-compass arc inextricable. Final image of painted stones singing chord offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in aurora/tide whispers; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature (Fibonacci hues, vibrating grains); rhythmic prose modulates to hum/rise at climax. Voice lyrical-consistent, lyric compression taught early via aurora ribbons/spirals. No dialogue; diction fits her cosmic bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Density high but paraphrase loops on "lingering promise" (5+ repeats) and "sacred patterns" churn dull propulsion in final third. Figurative coherent (violet flame/sunrise) but overwrites peak with stacked vehicles like "inhaling/exhaling mist." Rhythms vary; no template cadence but redundancy drags closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eel herder harnessing supernova dust via Fibonacci rocks post-friction silence transforms tropes organically. Final reconfiguration (tide carrying flame) inevitable from established patterns. Risky lyric poise heightens cosmic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
