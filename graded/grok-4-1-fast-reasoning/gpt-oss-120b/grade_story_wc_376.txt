<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's belief in candor drives refusal to council and map-piecing with embodied reactions via plate's glow, showing consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure; final restoration earns her arc with visible cost to prior isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from plate dimming to map alignment revealing cavern and conduit, culminating in on-page CR where whispered truth reconfigures toxic world with felt cost in her steady heart amid gray; orientation anchors early in workshop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring zinc plate and bioluminescent ferns constrain choices (plate guides honesty, ferns light piecing) and charge final green glow; sensory details like rust-taste wind and vine hums integrate purposefully, mirroring internal states without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring truth via candor tightens accumulatively through plate reactions narrowing to map-driven discoveries and vent whisper; agency in refusal and piecing forecloses dishonest path with legible cost in wilted world pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of candor stitching society emerges organically from plate/map events, reweighted in final brightening without statement; resonant image of vines singing offers non-literal answer to lost-truth question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature biased toward truthful glows and wilts; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with rising discoveries, maintaining perceptual filter without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy revelations amid lyrical stretches; high figurative density purposeful in accumulative pattern but occasional near-paraphrase (wilt/dry motifs) slightly dulls propulsion in cavern beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-detecting plate and bottled conversations in greenhouse transforms post-apoc tropes; map-to-conduit progression feels inevitable from established candor rules, risking magical logic payoff.</comment>
