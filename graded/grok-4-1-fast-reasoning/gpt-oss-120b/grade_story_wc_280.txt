<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost's motivation rooted in yearning for encore, intensifies through embodied synesthesia ("colors that hummed," "voice a chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet"). Final expansion to peace earned via prior echoes, with shopkeeper as crucible forcing relational shift. Minor abstract epiphany ("realized his purpose") lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes and orchard responses builds to Charged Poise closure where timeline aligns and ghost's essence expands ("each echo now a bridge"). Orientation anchored early (theater backstage by ~50 words). One tightening via coin placement and singing narrows to cosmic mend; cost legible in "final echo drift away, leaving behind a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard and maze constrain choices (drifts via apple scent, hedges sway in harmony), charging final image (apples fall like applause). Sensory hierarchy synesthetic and POV-biased (hums as colors/scents). Details evolve causally (coin warms, projects stage).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend timeline) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening echoes/orchard response, forcing agency in singing/amplifying. Tightening forecloses isolation as shopkeeper joins. Cost felt in dimming lights and drifting echo, charging shopkeeper's tomorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of summoning hope from despair emerges via particulars (echoes stitching timeline, apples as luminous notes). Final image (sunrise, coin as sunrise symbol) offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Rising nostalgia reweights prior loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("scent of ripe apples," "violin's sigh"). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic, sensory diction modulating to peak intensity. No head-hopping; elision of backstory purposeful and anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but overwriting via figurative stacks in peak ("ripples of color that painted the night sky with memories") dulls propulsion slightly (−0.5). Purposeful "echo" repetition taught early avoids loop penalty. Rhythms vary for ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost/orchard synthesis transforms stage-haunt trope into fresh cosmic mend. Risky accumulative texture heightens stakes via environmental agency (trees hum chords). Inevitable hindsight: coin/echoes lure possibility organically.</comment>
