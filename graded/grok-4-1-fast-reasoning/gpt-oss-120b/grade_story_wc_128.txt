<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to uplift silent contributors drives choices like slipping the locket and creating the Compassion Register, but interiority relies on labels like "cautious exuberance" without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany at lighthouse feels unearned and tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from envelope misdelivery to lighthouse discovery and full-moon ceremony; CR closure lands in final image of Mara's renewed purpose reweighting community narrative with conceptual cost of shared stories, but structure meanders in summary-like passages without tight beat progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "scent of brine and old paper" and "breezy curtains fluttered under the stars" integrate into action, with library and lighthouse subtly guiding Mara's walk and gesture on balcony; recurring stars and breeze mirror internal states without overt symbolism, charging final ceremony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of returning locket and uplifting contributors deepens accumulatively through realizations, but lacks coherent pressure or on-page reversal narrowing options; low opposition and abstract communal "ripple" dilute cost legibility in climax at lighthouse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges from images like locket on balcony, but direct statements ("cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo") and final-paragraph moralizing ("negotiate not just freight but the flow of kindness") trigger thematic echo penalty, replacing earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in Mara's eye for "slightest flicker of curiosity"; rhythmic prose modulates poetically, but minor overwriting in descriptive runs slightly dulls immediacy without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "cycles of compassion") creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs, and dense figurative language ("constellations twinkled like lanterns") in non-peak beats lacks pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; template cadence in descriptive sentences like those opening pier walk drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cargo broker as compassion conduit via misdelivered envelope transforms seaside tropes organically; ingenuity in Compassion Register ceremony feels earned from particulars, though sentimental arc borders familiar territory.</comment>
