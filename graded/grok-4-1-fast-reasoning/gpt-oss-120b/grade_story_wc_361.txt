<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Courier's jittery embodiment and mentor-rooted motivation compel micro-choices like offering the pendant to the shepherd and girl, earning small triumphs. Internal reflections anchor in present cues without flattening pressure. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses or visible flaws complicating the affirming arc, keeping it from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pendant-synced encounters builds from shepherd's spark to girl's map revelation, tightening mythic resonance. Orientation anchors immediately in ridgeway race. Closure as CR lands cleanly in final pilgrimage image with pendant's dimming as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway vividly filters through courier's perceptual bias, with pulsing lights syncing heartbeat and pendant to constrain onward journey. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal wonder without overt symbolism. Recurring aurora charges final vanishing image, constraining the mythic fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to coax wonder accumulates coherently under Textural lens via pendant's intensifying pulses, deepening from routine shepherd to girl's hidden garden map. One tightening via stronger pulse sensing spirits narrows to legendary scale. Stakes gentle, lacking visceral trade-off or foreclosed option beyond dimming glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of germinating myth from routine emerges organically through accumulating encounters, reweighted in caravan/pilgrimage legacy without statement. Final image offers non-literal resonance on mentor's lesson. Avoids tidy moralizing, embracing mythic ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature of vibrations/glows modulating rhythmically; syntax reflects courier's humming wonder. Minimal dialogue natural and sparse. Patterned elision of mythic fade taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of "vibrate/germinate/glow" as motif, varying rhythm without loops dulling propulsion. Minor figurative density in high beats coherent, not muddled. Slight paraphrase in repeated mentor recalls, but momentum holds to charged end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrating pendant as wonder-seeder transforms courier trope into inevitable mythic relay. Risky lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick. Particular details like dragonfly-wing heirloom feel organic to voice.</comment>
