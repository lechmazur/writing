<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority synesthetic and particular but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under pressure; motivation to certify wonder stated clearly yet untested by opposition in pivotal singing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to cadence shift at "reverberations settled"; CR closure in final image of pulsing sheet and enriched silence reconfigures hush with conceptual cost of enduring promise, legible at "outlast any stone".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aurora-veined ice and amber sheet integrate purposefully, constraining synesthetic perception and charging final pulsing image; sensory hierarchy vivid through POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early via purpose, with textural escalation in song's swelling density mirroring ice's breath; one deepening narrows to affirmation but lacks visceral trade-off at climax toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of essential wonder emerges organically from synesthetic images and hush-song interplay; final "even the coldest places hold a song" offers resonant CR reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature distinct and stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation purposeful in lyric compression, with no leakage during singing swell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overwriting in climax beat (every line metaphorical without restraint) and exact phrase loops ("through the colors of the aurora" x4) dull propulsion; hush paraphrases redundant across ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synesthetic premise transforms hush/song tropes into inevitable continuum; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via ice response without gimmickry.</comment>
