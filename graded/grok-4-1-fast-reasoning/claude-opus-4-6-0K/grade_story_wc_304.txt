<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through pattern-reading skill applied to aurora, with embodied stillness and devotion earning her final endurance; contradictory impulses in weeks of deliberation resolve in on-page choice of aurora over archives. Final tuck of chip into coat shows values hierarchy with world-cost acceptance. No safety-hedging; flaws as guild last-member heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via perceptual buildup holds to Charged Poise closure in final image of pulsing chip and dimming aurora, with legible cost as light "given away" and planet's unwinding. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene fits scope perfectly. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's translucent ice wall and radiant hush constrain infusion choice and charge final image; sensory selection (pulsing light, frost crystals) reflects Lira's priorities without tourist catalog. Environment evolves causally (aurora dims post-infusion). Micro-setting as tool/receptor indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early tightens accumulatively through perceptual deepening, narrowing to infusion agency; cost unmistakable in aurora dimming and her reverent precision foreclosing other archives. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-at-ending emerges from particulars (dead faces to planet's face), with final chip-as-coffin image offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; earned via pattern work, not platitude. Subtext in "mineral coffin" reweights passage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns in static/dead) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds under watchful stillness, diction controlled (e.g., "lucidly watchful"). No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates perception beats; metaphors coherent (chip "mineral coffin," aurora "singing as it unwound"). No overwriting, scaffolds, or artifacts; final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician-for-planet transforms end-of-world trope via specific guild craft and aurora-pattern capture; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure image (+0.3). Non-obvious angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
