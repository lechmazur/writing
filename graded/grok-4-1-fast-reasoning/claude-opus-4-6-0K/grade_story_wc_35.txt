<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in tasting grief yet folding it into meals; ungloved submersion and holding earn closure endurance with bodily cost in "fingers ached with a brittle translucence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to RR closure; cost legible in "bones had briefly become coral themselves" as before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fossil coral stone and tidal pools constrain choice to kneel/palms-down; final hands echo coral, charging image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing memories escalates via deliberate submersion under Textural lens; agency in "held" and "drew it inward" forecloses raw grief with translucent ache cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerges from tasting/folding particulars to CR in bread tasting "only of flour and salt," reweighting remorse premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic tasting/touch; rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at "flexed them. They held."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (sandpapering, folding) integrated into action; no loops, propulsion peaks at shudder/subsumption without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting, touch-contagion, and subterranean coral pavilion; risk in lyric submersion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
