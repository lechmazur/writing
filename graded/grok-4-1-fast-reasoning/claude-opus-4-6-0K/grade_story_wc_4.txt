<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shines in concrete details like arranging damp photos into arcs, rooting her archivist motivation in embodied grief; perceptively calm trait enables ongoing tending without tidy resolution. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+; endurance feels earned but unpressured by live opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from personal arcs to communal field, culminating in Charged Poise closure: "the puzzle... meant to be tended," reweighting grief with ongoing cost legible in lingering amid vines. Orientation anchors early (lavender field, factory ruins); single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (lavender exhaling in waves, vines gripping rust) filters through Maren's bias, with recurring vines constraining final image as slow ascent mirroring transformation. Micro-setting charges closure: bench faces arcs, enabling linger amid "strange, sweet algebra of ruin and bloom."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute pain) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via townspeople's response and completed arc narrowing to endurance; cost felt in "bent not away from pain but through it." Agency in pinning photos and lingering forecloses erasure for holding; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-tended-puzzle emerges organically from arcs, vines, and field, with final image offering non-literal resonance: butterfly-blurred photo bridges to "something kinder" without moralizing. Particulars like child's handprint avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in unsolved puzzle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (visual grammars, cartographies of grief) biases noticing toward transformation; rhythmic modulation peaks in lyrical closure without head-hopping or elision. Lyrical compression taught early via arcs sustains texture under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "scars are just stories the body tells"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, with purposeful arc motif avoiding loops. Minor figurative density ("ribs of a cathedral," "moth's wing") consistent and pattern-taught, not muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief memorial as living arcs/vines transforms ruin tropes; "visual grammar for what words could not hold" offers non-obvious angle. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
