<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's trust arc earned via contradictory impulses (pigeons released empty vs. sharing meteorite lore) and micro-choices like cataloging talon edges; chest unknotting reveals embodied cost pivotal to endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from solo dust-reading to shared melody; Elias' trapdoor arrival causal inciting incident tightens to Charged Poise closure where "mote that refuses to fall" reconfigures stakes with past-loss cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight as micro-setting constrain preservation choices (left drift cues dehumidifier) and charge final image, mirroring internal compass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of preservation vs. hoarding silence deepens agency-driven via Elias collaboration to melody test; "notes mourning its own passing" viscerally charges cost in Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "still point where memory... held, suspended" non-literal resonant answer reweights preservation theme without moralizing, emergent from paper/stone/dust particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (archivist filters via ink stains, thumb-oil) with lyrical rhythm sustains under pressure; sparse dialogue subtextual (Elias' "you'd know what the songs meant" cracks her).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, rhythm modulates (short punchy dust-reading to blooming melody line "opened like a flower and immediately began to shed its petals" perfect for sonic climax).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Meteorite "pitch pipe from another world" on fiddle bridge non-obvious synthesis of alien density/ unearthly notes heightens stakes organically, risk-taking lyric accumulation pays off inevitable.</comment>
