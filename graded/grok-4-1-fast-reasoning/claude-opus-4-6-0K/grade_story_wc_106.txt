<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's tension between "turn and walk sensibly home" and following the light, earning the closure realization; interiority particular via light-obsessed perception. Flawless single-POV embodiment with no stock phrasing. Final portfolio embrace reveals values hierarchy with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: flower code → jar light → portfolio → reinterpretation builds to CR closure in "I see you seeing," reweighting legacy with inheritance cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words at station. No ambiguity; decisive final image pays off pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Station's ivy-sheathed copper and liquid moonlight constrain path via jar light on rails, charging closure's rafter star. Sensory hierarchy (light dominance) reflects POV bias perfectly. Details evolve causally from gold-to-indigo, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grandmother's message) signaled early via kiosk code; accumulative deepening narrows from curiosity to legacy acceptance, foreclosing doubt with emotional cost in portfolio hold. Agency in uncapping jar and translating note drives turns. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in final release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of light-revealed seeing emerges organically from portrait inheritance, resonant CR in grandmother's letter reweighting "beauty belonged to whoever witnessed it first." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "enough." Final image answers without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature light-drenched (e.g., "sun poured honey"); rhythm modulates from anticipatory to poised. No head-hopping or elision withholding. Compression taught early, legible at moonbeam star.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—light motifs consistent. Minor figurative density fits pattern without peak-beat overwrite. Closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of portrait theft, flower codes, moonjar transforms tropes via legacy rule-set. Risky lyric accumulative structure inevitable in hindsight; final reconfiguration bold without gimmick.</comment>
