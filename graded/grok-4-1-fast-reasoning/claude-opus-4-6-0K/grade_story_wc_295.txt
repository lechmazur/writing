<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as lucid dream chronicler roots choices in concrete expertise, culminating in earned witnessing that heals Gregor's grief with visible emotional cost. Interiority particular via dream architecture metaphors; contradictory impulses in balancing solitude and connection subtle but embodied. Gregor as secondary applies relational pressure, his eyes closing a pivotal reveal of boyhood grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density from dreams/glyphs/stars tightens to undeniable correlation, landing Charged Poise closure in "observatory felt...mercifully, close" with Gregor's grief reconfiguration as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in observatory summit and Elara's role. Single scene coherent, no shards or disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's copper dome, tracking motors, archive constrain night work and supply rubbings/charts that enable decoding. Sensory selectivity (creak of dome, hum) reflects Elara's priorities; final Mira pulse charges closure image, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting via notebooks/star charts guides alignment choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode glyphs) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative lens in telegram/discovery tightening options to validation. Agency in aligning notebooks/charts forecloses isolation path; cost legible in Gregor's grief processing. One meaningful deepening sufficient, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges from glyph decode "what two carry together becomes a bridge" and witnessing, resonant non-literal answer in final Mira heartbeat reweighting solitude to connection. Subtext in daylily veins/patterns; no moralizing, complexity in Seda's madness reframed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Elara with perceptual signature (dreams as celestial cartography); voice rhythmic, modulates from midnight solace to closeness. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("She tried to tell people"), advances via Gregor's grief reveal. No head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "daylily...stained glass" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (understanding as "slow suffusion"), coherent without muddle in peak decode beat. Propulsion peaks in alignment moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dreams/glyphs/variable stars as burden-language, transformed via Seda's telegram into witnessing arc. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final image inevitable, no derivative echoes. Bold conceptual integrity in stellar rhythm as ancient script.</comment>
