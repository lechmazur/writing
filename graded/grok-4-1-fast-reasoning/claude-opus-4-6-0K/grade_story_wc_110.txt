<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of intrusion vs. need for honesty) act in her silent holding of the lens and timed apology; final lens handoff earns relational thaw with visible vulnerability cost. Registrar trait particularizes her quiet precision in doodles and speech. Jonah's eavesdropping reveals parallel flaws without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards deepen silence stake, culminating in Charged Poise RR via lens exchange where "honesty, offered plainly, was the only door that opened from both sides." Orientation anchors Maren/forecourt early. Cost legible in relational fear foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forecourt's faceted pillars and chimes constrain eavesdropping detection and charge final image: light through lens scatters "like something breathing," mirroring emotional thaw. Sensory selectivity (water cracks, trembling constellation) reflects urgency. No white-room; lived-in post-rain coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (thaw mistrust) signaled via prior eavesdrops; single tightening via her apology and his ticket reveal narrows options, forcing trade-off of pride for transparency under Accumulative lens. Agency in micro-choices (not turning, lens placement); cost felt in "fear" endured. Escalation coherent without reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (honesty frees after silence) emerges implicitly from doodles' ambiguity shifting to plain speech; final hush reconfigures "words...impossible" premise without moralizing. Relational irony (eavesdropping to hear apology) builds resonance. Particulars (lens light) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Maren-dominant, clean Jonah shift via action); perceptual signature in "half-sound, half-silence." Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven: her registrar-quiet apology pursues thaw. Prose rhythm modulates tension to hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density (e.g., "grief needed a target and love needed a witness" layers stakes/emotion). Rhythm varies for propulsion: short declarative dialogue amid lyrical setting. No figurative muddle; "scattered light moved like something breathing" propels peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via projector lens/doodles synthesis, yielding fresh "ambiguously clear" communication; forecourt whispering innovates quiet reconciliation. Risk in lyric hush closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry. Organic integration avoids templates.</comment>
