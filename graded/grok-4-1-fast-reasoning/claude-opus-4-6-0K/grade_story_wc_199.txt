<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orderly traits drive concrete micro-choices like sorting and monument-building, earning transformation; interiority embodied in "feeling the arbor hold its breath"; subtle contradiction in eleven-season failure resolves via prior devotion without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaf patterns + speck discovery + monument prodding accumulate to CR closure ("She emerged transformed"); orientation anchored in first line; cost legible in root-threaded fingers foreclosing old stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor constrains precision ("misplaced seed could sprout nightshade"); recurring workbench/tools charge final image (sorting while singing); sensory hierarchy via Wren's ear for seed hums and leaf veins reflects priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via speck-monument beat narrowing to self-realization; agency in prodding forces trade-off (old devotion for transformation); cost unmistakable in chest-cracking shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (devotion ripens receiver) emerges via particulars like leaf veins and monuments, reweighted in "the message had never been in the leaves"; final image answers without stating: arbor sings back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("veins spelled something"); stable close-third POV biases to orderly details (seed hums, spirals); rhythmic modulation peaks in transformation beat without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "built it a monument" advances character/cause); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence like "moss believes in stone" enhances without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-arbor folklore + seed-sorter alchemy transforms trope of prophecy quest; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes via irreplaceable monument-speck pivot; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
