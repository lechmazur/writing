<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between crisis actor betrayal and survivor authenticity acts in scene via chessboard touch and walking choices; final unbinding renunciation earned with felt cost of "merciless toward the fiction." Micro-choices like spelling names reveal values hierarchy under self-imposed pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry/purpose to walking pattern to CR closure where whisper returns unchanged, reweighting memory with conceptual cost of unrecorded acts; persistent gallery constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains walking/spelling choices and charges final whisper image; chessboard pawns as micro-setting recur to mirror internal states; luminous emptiness tactile via rain entry and footsteps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind via remembering gestures) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through pattern spelling names that narrow to borderland realization; agency in footsteps forecloses staged performance path with betrayal cost legible in "small betrayal."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncelebrated pawns/kindnesses emerges organically from chessboard, walking names, and final echo reweighting spectacular history; resonant non-literal answer in gallery "remembering" without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "luminous" absence and embodied motion; rhythmic syntax modulates from reflective entry to charged walking propulsion; purposeful lyric compression taught early via footsteps pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythms and no loops; figurative language purposeful in peak realization ("nomadic penumbra," "borderland drifts") without muddle; minor density elevation in metaphors fits accumulative texture without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking-as-writing in acoustic gallery transforms crisis actor trope; risk-taking in pattern-taught choreography and pawnless chessboard heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
