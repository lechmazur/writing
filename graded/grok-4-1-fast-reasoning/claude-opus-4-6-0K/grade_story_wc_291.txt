<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in building empathy manually without recognition create interior tension; final weeping earned by 44 days' strokes. Methodical trait compels portrait completion with visible emotional cost. Minor slip in naming "prosopagnosia" but embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of strokes builds to coherent face on day 44, reconfiguring case indifference. Closure as Charged Poise in holding drawing to water, with quarry's mist as felt witness-cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quarry's granite walls and mist constrain station setup and charge final image of "mist patient and faceless." Sensory hierarchy (mist as milk, swallowed sound) mirrors Maren's structural perception. Recurring water evokes submerged evidence, guiding choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct face to awaken empathy/reopen case) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to "face becoming coherent." Agency in daily devotion forecloses indifference with on-page weeping cost. Pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence from absence emerges via opposites unification, resonant in final rearview mist sharing secret. No moralizing; ribbon's tremble recharges motif non-literally. Complexity in manual empathy lingers without tidy arcs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: structural deductions ("if left zygomatic arch... nose must project"). Rhythmic control modulates to piercing awareness; diction purposeful, no head-hopping. Voice as methodical mind intact under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "Each charcoal stroke was a logical deduction"). Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent ("needle penetrates fabric"). Minor elevated diction fits artist lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind artist logically reconstructs unseen faces transforms cold-case trope. Risk in methodical opposites method heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via quarry communion. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual limits drive ingenuity.</comment>
