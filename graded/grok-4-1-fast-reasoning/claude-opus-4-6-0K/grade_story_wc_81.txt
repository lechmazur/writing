<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between industrial speed and personal depth act in the blackout shift; final slower indexing earned by stamp discoveries with cost of Bureau rejection. Interiority concrete via grandmother's trembling hands memory anchoring present choice. Tranquilly perceptive trait enables dim-light impressions without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of stamp impressions builds to cadence shift in reclaimed stillness; closure as Charged Poise in final deliberate smoothing of page reconfigures options with conceptual cost of speed foreclosed. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in library blackout. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "not proof. Not yet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent cables and barnacles constrain via blackout-forced dim headlamp, enabling stamp discovery; recurring endpapers charge final stamp match image. Sensory hierarchy (groaning bones, pressure regulators) reflects indexer's priorities. Micro-setting of waterlogged shelves guides tactile search without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace origins vs. Bureau speed) signaled early, tightens via blackout-deepened alternative hypothesis narrowing to family legacy; agency in manual documenting forecloses fast scanning with felt cost. Escalation as density increase under Accumulative lens coherent to closure. No abstract stakes; price in unuploaded notes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honest origins via stillness emerges from stamp particulars, not statement; final image of pocketed stamp against impression offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moral. Subtext in grandmother's disbelief ache interleaves with present discoveries. No tidy binary; ambiguity in "not proof yet" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (indexer bias to stamps/endpapers); rhythmic modulation accelerates in discovery, breathes in stillness. Diction controlled, syntax reflects tranquil perception degrading to purposeful touch. No head-hopping; elision of Bureau upload taught early, paid in deliberate restart.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density with propulsion (e.g., "faint impressions... nearly become the paper itself" advances multiple jobs). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no figurative muddle, metaphors apt (city's bones groaning). Paragraph cut test passes; opening anchors stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library indexers tracing ink stamps synthesizes archival sci-fi freshly via tactile family legacy; quiet Accumulative closure risks lyric poise successfully, heightening stakes without gimmick. Transformation of trope (lost city) through hypothesis shift on printing integration. Bold in solo-POV stillness payoff.</comment>
