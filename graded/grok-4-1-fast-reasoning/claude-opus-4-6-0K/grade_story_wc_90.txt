<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifism roots every choice, from enduring raiders to final stitching, with embodied bittersweet sorrow ("deep, clean sadness that paradoxically made her lighter") acting as contradictory impulses that earn the closure's resolve without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from drift to archive ritual to dimension's eye-opening CR, with legible cost in her undefended grief; orientation anchors immediately in spaceship/post-human void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recycled hull panels and tear-shimmered photos constrain ritual choices and charge final blooming light; sensory hierarchy (air billowing, emulsion rivers) filters through her archival priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to open Undershadow via sorrow escalates accumulatively through lightness and stitching, narrowing to her agency in "I see you"; cost of lifelong renunciation felt in thinning shadows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief-lightening repression emerges organically via relics joining, culminating in resonant CR where shadows answer, reweighting pacifism's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (ghost-memories, weightless sorrow) modulates rhythmically with intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure's eye-opening image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures ("cathedral built from bones," "opened like an eye") without muddle or loops; peak stitching beat clarifies cause/effect flawlessly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tear-emulsion physics and shadow dimension transforms sci-fi tropes through her relic-ritual; risky pacifist premise commits fully, with stitching turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
