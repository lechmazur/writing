<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory stoic sensitivity acts in unflinching wade and note-writing choice; hierarchy of values revealed when inkwell presses "like a heartbeat," earning final renunciation of mere measurement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as note discoveries build to Charged Poise CR in sealed exchange; cost legible in "pavilion sinking another imperceptible fraction" blurring against dark water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's cracks constrain wresting action and supply notes; headlamp's "hushed fire" and cold water "climbing her thighs" charge final bank vigil, filtering through surveyor's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to claim final note and respond deepens via prior discoveries, forcing endurance trade-off; agency peaks in sealing reply amid erosion threat, with physical exposure as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "two strangers' words... pressed together like palms in prayer" non-literally answers absence-with-love question, reweighting decay as connection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "concrete resisted... small bone snapping"; propulsion via varied syntax peaks at note unfolds, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of surveyor decoding builder's grief in eroding pavilion feels inevitable; quiet risk in solo accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
