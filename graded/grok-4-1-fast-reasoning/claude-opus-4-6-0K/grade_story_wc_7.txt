<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shines in concrete embodiment like pruning as "act of faith," revealing contradictory impulses of quiet defiance against regulations; final grafting earned by causal buildup of patient tending. Flawless micro-choices under inspector pressure align traits without idealization. Single-POV coherence with no therapy-speak elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pruning to alignment-triggered growth, tasting, grafting, sprouting, resolving in Charged Poise closure with inspectors' tears losing paperwork as felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Maren, greenhouse, mornings). One tightening via seed's burst suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and "rust-streaked soil" constrain choices (daily pruning, potting rust/glass), charging final image of window-planted seeds. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (feral growth respected); spatial coherence flawless. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal decay-to-beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle rebellion vs. regulations) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to inspector lunch where memory-soup forces trade-off, foreclosing enforcement path with visible emotional cost. Agency in offering lunch tests commitment; no coincidences resolve. One tightening via celestial trigger coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion-through-nourishment emerges organically from pruning images and memory-tasting, culminating in resonant final line "feed you before you realize you were starving" reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like soup-evoked childhoods charge subtext; ambiguity lingers in implied future costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("decay not as an ending but as a conversation") biases noticing toward adaptive growth; rhythmic control modulates from calm pruning to burst-growth intensity. Stable third-limited POV with no leakage; sparse dialogue natural when present (mother's "It'll know when").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pruning was an act of faith — removing what existed to make room for what might"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful ("sky between copper and grief") without muddle in peaks. Propulsion aligns with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory-tasting chef trope via knowledge fruit's synaptic growth and grafted rust-pots, synthesizing into fresh "gentle rebellion" premise. Risky celestial trigger and adaptive plant yield inevitable hindsight ingenuity; no derivatives, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
