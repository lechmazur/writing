<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete embodiment like "throat had forgotten the shape of words" and micro-choices under pressure (holding still as vine nears swan), earning final endurance without judgment; contradictory temptation to interpret yields to stasis with felt cost of crumbling peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to vine's approach and withdrawal, delivering Charged Poise closure in final exhale and stillness; cost legible in "peace of the catacombs was crumbling" reconfigured by regenerative silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Overgrown library and swan constrain witnessing (vines pull books, tendril brushes swan), charging final image; sensory selection (river pulse through walls, pale flowers breathing) reflects POV looseness without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness without judgment) deepens via vine's rhythmic advance narrowing to swan's peril, forcing endurance; agency in poised inaction forecloses interpretation with cost felt in encroaching dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of change as regeneration emerges organically from books-to-shoots and vine-swan tension, reweighted in final "river's patient hand shaping stone"; resonant CR without moralizing, ambiguity in vine's retreat lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("gripped reality loosely," folds as burrowing) modulates rhythmically under subtle pressure; stable close-third POV biases toward loose witnessing, no elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, coherent metaphors (silence "actively restored," paper like earth); rhythmic propulsion peaks in vine's brush and exhale, varying syntax supports regenerative hush without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami chronicle in rotting library transforms witness trope via geometric recording and vine interaction; risk in lyric poise pays off, inevitable hindsight from early folds to final burrow.</comment>
