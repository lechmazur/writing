<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caul's personalities drive actions like molting to charm the warden; Maren's arc from closed fist to blooming hand earned via shelving choices. Minor smoothness in her epiphanies lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sorting to reorganization to handoff; CR closure in onionskin pages gifted, reweighting resistance with cost of physical proof memorized. Orientation anchored early in rusted library arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Open-sky library constrains night work and inmate privacy; recurring stars and rusted beams charge final parking garage image mirroring premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of blooming resistance signaled early, tightens via warden threat forcing Caul's molt; cost legible in reluctant moon and page handoff foreclosing preservation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges organically from shelving by wound to poems on pillars; final concrete image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting destruction without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Maren's perceptual bias in star-sieve imagery; dialogue subtextual as in "Resistance that blooms opens into a hand," distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic control with varied syntax and purposeful similes like "stars poured... like light through a sieve"; minor density slip in simile clusters mid-story but no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional shelving and personality-molting poet transforms prison trope; risk in non-alphabetic reorganization heightens stakes organically.</comment>
