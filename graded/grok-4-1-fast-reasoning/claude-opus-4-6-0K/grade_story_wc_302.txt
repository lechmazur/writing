<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (exuberance tempered by gravity) act in decoding and peak in tearing pages; final selective documentation earned by prior causal buildup with visible cost on shelves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream layers, decoding cycles, and revelations tightens to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "tore out seven pages and fed them to the mist," reweighting silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing library, mist, and watch constrain decoding and final dissolution of pages, charging exit image; selective sensory hierarchy (honeyed light, ticking delays) mirrors interpretive urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access unspoken words) signaled early, deepens via decoding gravity under Accumulative lens; agency in selective documentation forecloses paths with on-page trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("some silences...seeds waiting") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise from hidden loss to propagative potential, emergent from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (reversed patterns, delays as meaning); rhythmic control modulates from dream-shrouded to synchronized heartbeat, elisions taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated figures (e.g., "symbols blooming...peeling back"); zero loops, no muddle in peak decoding beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Library of unspoken words and delay-cipher premise synthesize fresh conceit; risk of reversed temporality heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
