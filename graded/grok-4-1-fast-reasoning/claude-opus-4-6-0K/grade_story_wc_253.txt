<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blank-faced performer excels in embodied micro-choices like whittling the sparrow's beak, revealing contradictory impulses between distance and unnamed tremor; final endurance of narration earns change with cost of shapeless grief. Interiority particular via stage cadence in empty room. No therapy-speak flattens crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: narration layers density from whittling to bouquet to breathing, tightening to Charged Poise closure in "something shifted... she begins again" with legible cost of turbines' endless turn. Orientation anchored early (turbines, farmhouse, post-funeral). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbine shadows sweeping kitchen constrain hands during whittling, charging final image of blades strobing bare fields; bouquet and pine tactile, mirror internal void via scentless gesture. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (performer notices cadence, light). Micro-setting (knife, wood) shapes choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via narration's deepening (from sparrow to tremor), forcing endurance that forecloses raw feeling with cost in "did not chase it." Agency in persistent whittling/narration under mandate pressure. One tightening suffices, cost unmistakable in ongoing blankness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of performed vs. genuine emotion emerges organically from particulars like lopsided sparrow beside scentless bouquet, resonant non-literal answer in "she begins again" reweighting mandate's hush without moralizing. Subtext in ambiguous survival ethics lingers via counter-readings of narration. Final image recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in performative narration ("pitched to the empty room in the cadence of a stage performer") biases noticing toward shaped story over raw feel; rhythmic control modulates from precise whittling syntax to breathing pause. Stable close third, no head-hopping. Prose reflects blank mind's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "turbine shadows passed over her hands" advances atmosphere/action/closure); rhythm varies naturally, no loops or scaffolds, read-aloud propulsive. Zero figurative muddle in peak (tremor beat clean). Opening anchors stakes via whittling narration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with quiet farm whittling/performance transforms grief trope via turbines' mechanical hymn vs. organic sparrow; risk in accumulative lyric closure heightens stakes of emotional hush. Inevitable hindsight from narrated tasks to tremor. Non-obvious angle on survival ethics.</comment>
