<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory distrust of volunteers clashes with "pressure into diamonds" theology in real-time micro-choices like texting back, earning the volunteer decision with embodied cost in chest pressure; no safety-hedging, flaws drive mercy toward other self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as message density and manifestations (patterns to solid, bolt appearance) tighten toward on-page collapse with legible cost ("every dimension's worth of pressure settle into her chest"); closure as Charged Poise in diamond image reconfigures multiversal permutations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms constrain choices (bolt in substrate, lean on projections) and charge final image (diamond scatters rainbows across ceiling); sensory hierarchy (blue hands, damp earth, copper-starlight dust) filters through farmer's tactile priorities, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold quantum collapse) signaled early, escalates via textural density (glitchy messages to physical fear shadow) driven by agency (text back, thread bolt), narrowing to volunteer trade-off with on-page cost in geological inward fold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-alchemy emerges implicitly via pyramid betrayal to diamond proof, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting promise (false exponential vs. patient luminosity) without moralizing; conceptual cost undeniable in multiversal thanks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (fungi "pulsed with their own cold light," dread "crystallize like frost along her vertebrae") biases noticing toward growth/resurrection; rhythmic control modulates from cool to warm blaze under pressure, stable without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("She threaded the submarine porthole bolt onto a chain of mycelium fiber"), varied syntax/rhythm supports accumulative build; figurative language purposeful and coherent (light "solid smoke"), no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms multiverse trope via mushroom-farm specificity and shadowseam physics into inevitable diamond synthesis; bold risk in concepts-physicalizing charges stakes organically, no derivative hedging.</comment>
