<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied "shivering bliss" at patterns revealing contradictory thrill amid withdrawal; final reach for fruit earns change from retreat to fertile silence, with cost of shed armor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from pattern-tracing to reality shift; closure as Charged Poise in fruit-reach reconfigures possibilities with legible cost of foreclosed knightly past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard's glowing fruit and silver mist constrain perceptions and charge final image as "warm as a living hand"; selective details mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to grasp possibility tightens accumulatively via pattern-induced shift; agency in whispering oath forecloses past with on-page armor drop, cost felt in deepened night layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from orchard spiral to final unnamed luminous beginning; resonant fruit-image reweights withdrawal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward geometric mysticism; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to "trembling structure," heightening pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from "air...texture" shift to greenhouse-breathing cadence; no loops, figurative layers purposeful and coherent in mystical register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marionette diagrams, knightly patterns, and alchemical fruit transforms withdrawal trope; bold lyric risk in reality-folding payoff feels inevitable.</comment>
