<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via persistent needle-pressing amid numbness versus experiment persistence; final relic renunciation earned by causal buildup of failed sessions, with embodied cost in silent weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from backstory shards to nightly sessions tightens to frost-night DC (sternum hum), reconfiguring numbness with legible emotional cost in "She wept without sound."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Limestone walls as membrane and stone floor constrain sensory reception, charging final image where palms on ground enable breakthrough; seasonal frost anchors time, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, escalates via pattern break in reversed lullaby tightening options; agency in nightly endurance forecloses defensive numbness with on-page weeping cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unrecognized emotion bypassing defenses emerges implicitly via backward songs' unraveling; final hush-as-gathering-space reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with vibration-biased perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from hush-density to humming release, elisions taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence; figurative "filament of hush" purposeful without muddle, clarity peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reversed audio for deaf emotional repair feels inevitable via phonograph accident seed; risk in lyric reflection interleaving transforms disability trope organically.</comment>
