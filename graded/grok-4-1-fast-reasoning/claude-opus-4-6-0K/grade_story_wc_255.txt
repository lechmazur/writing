<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Maren's softness disarming merchants while cunningly boosting Aster's business; final garden arrangement earned by reed integration with felt relational cost. Interiority concrete via values over colors. Voice particular to her perceptual limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden to reed affixation to Aster's breath unlocking a reconfiguration. Closure as Charged Poise in "small unlocking" and barter completion with undeniable relational cost legible in final line. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/phoenix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard heat warps air, constraining painting via kiln warmth and herb placements that guide Aster's choices; final furnace image recharges phoenix motif. Sensory hierarchy via Maren's values-not-colors filter. Micro-setting (reed/canvas) charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of imperfect resonance tightens accumulatively with reed's affixation narrowing options to vulnerability; agency in protruding "metallic wound" forecloses safe art. Cost felt in Aster's shift and unequal barter. Minor abstractness before reed slightly mutes peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect resonance emerges from reed's whisper reweighting colorblind limits; final image of breathing furnace answers without moralizing. Subtext in Aster's rosemary reading ties barter to awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "luminous grammar of what remains when color is taken away"; rhythmic control modulates from molten shimmer to half-dark breath. Dialogue subtextual: Aster's "junk" reveals status shift. Stable close third, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "reed tongue protrude like a small metallic wound" advancing texture and image; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops. Purposeful lyric metaphors coherent, no overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind painting interactive via breath and plant-code commerce transforms disability trope; reed's imperfect note as awakening hinge feels inevitable. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
