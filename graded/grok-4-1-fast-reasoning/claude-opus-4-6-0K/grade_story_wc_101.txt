<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in protecting anonymity and building support shows through micro-choices like never ringing before midnight and her quiet declaration; interiority concrete in feeling the bell's weight and pressing the drawing to her chest. Contradictory endurance of silence compels the final act of replacing the drawing. Flawless under pressure with visible cost in sustained community silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: layers of absences and runs build to declaration then child's drawing as CR closure, reweighting anonymity with conceptual cost in "enormous silence." Orientation anchored early in arbor and ridge. One tightening via speech to envelope suffices; cost legible in placing drawing back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like pillars "catching the last warmth" and "ruts beneath her boots" filter through Maren's priorities, constraining runs (patrols, switchbacks) and charging final arbor image. Micro-setting (pillar, bell) shapes choices and resonance. No white-room; lived-in evolution from night climb to dark ridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival via anonymous pulse tightens texturally through ninth-month absences to declaration forcing silent affirmation; agency in runs and speech forecloses recognition path with felt cost in unthanked hands. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; drawing crystallizes stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent generosity emerges organically from particulars like pillar envelopes and drawing's "For everyone," reweighting premise in final image without statement. Resonance in intergenerational rhythm (Yelena/Tarik) answers central question of unseen giving. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in protected silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile details (bell's "cold weight," shoulders burning); rhythmic control modulates from run's urgency to arbor's quiet poise. Speech natural, amplified without tags. No head-hopping; diction biased to Maren's protective lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture (e.g., "arches darker than the sky"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, purposeful figurative language like "skeleton of memory" integrates without muddle. Propulsion peaks in declaration to silence cadence. Zero artifacts; read-aloud flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions-era exile with anonymous child's drawing transforming arbor into generational handoff; risk in quiet declaration heightens stakes without gimmick. Non-obvious angle on survival via silence feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold tone commitment elevates.</comment>
