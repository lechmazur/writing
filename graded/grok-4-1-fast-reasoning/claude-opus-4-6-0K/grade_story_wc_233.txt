<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment and dream-pull create contradictory impulses shown in leaving despite warnings and pressing on at ember grotto; final renunciation earned by embodied residue (metallic taste, bruise) and rawer mutual yearning realization. Maren's softly commanding silence forces micro-choice reliance without exposition. No diagnostic labels; flaws (disenchantment) complicate throne-abandonment with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream residue accumulates to cobalt grotto revelation as CR (wound reweights to seam), with cost in "I am not going back." Orientation anchored early (Elara, Vethara Ridge climb); one tightening via fireflies weaving silver threads pays off charged poise closure. No ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember/cobalt grottos constrain climb/rest and charge final image (starlight pooling, fireflies rising); sensory hierarchy (warm stone, hissing threads) reflects Elara's dream-biased urgency. Spatial choreography clear (base to cloudline); details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams vs. throne warnings) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fireflies' gold-silver absorption reweighting unraveling to yearning; agency in climb/observance forecloses return path with legible cost ("throne will not wait" echoes). No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of pretenses vs. raw seams emerges from particulars (cold treaties to bleeding threads met by fireflies); final image offers non-literal answer ("kneeling inside it") reweighting crown-power without moralizing. Subtext in Maren's hand-squeeze and shared exhale; ambiguity lingers in open abandonment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable on Elara's perceptual signature (lace/bruise metaphors); rhythm modulates from dream-texture to terse dialogue ("We keep going"). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elisions taught via residue priming revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "lace made of something that could cut" layers menace/beauty without muddle); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak (fireflies rising). Figuratives coherent/patterned around bleeding/weaving; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of queenly disenchantment with cosmic yearning via grottos/fireflies transforms trope; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick. Final reconfiguration ("mutual yearning... like destruction") inevitable from dream particulars; no derivative templates.</comment>
