<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (grasping crumbling auk cries); contradictory impulses (endure exile vs. live through memories) act in reorganization beats; final endurance of brittle losses earned with visible cost in daily brass captures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: memory density and tidal mappings build to charged poise closure; cost legible in "caught it in brass before it disappeared," reconfiguring solitude with undeniable price of dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal shelves and stone circle constrain choices (rope bridges built, hum triggers memories); brass sundial as micro-setting charges final image of preservation amid loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dissolving memories, redefine isolation) signaled early, deepens via reorganization under accumulative lens; agency in endurance forecloses loneliness path, cost felt in brittle fragments threatening to dissolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of chosen independence emerges organically from extinction theft contrast; final image ("alone. She was not lonely.") offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tides as "sea" rhythms); rhythmic control modulates from brittle awakenings to poised mornings; stable close-third with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "sharp enough to cut" metaphors coherent, purposeful); zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to closure image without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation memories, tidal library, extinction neighbors feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
