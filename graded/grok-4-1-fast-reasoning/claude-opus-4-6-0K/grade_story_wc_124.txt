<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's aromatic caution creates contradictory impulses, constraining her vial uncapping amid silphium scent; grief as fidelity earns closure change with embodied cost in tear recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as scent density builds to CR in "bonds written in chemistry"; vial uncapping delivers Charged Poise with legible emotional cost at "tears... recognition."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>UV lamps and extinct plants constrain revelation, fluorescing veins to mirror internal unveiling; recurring crystal shadows charge final walk, grounding extinction parallel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand scent-tears tightens via silphium-vial collision, forcing endurance of grief; agency in uncapping forecloses avoidance with on-page embodied price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silphium-lavender as "third thing, unprecedented and devastating" resonates chemical memory without moral; extinct plants reweight personal loss organically in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (scent-veins-shadows) biases toward olfactory revelation; dialogue subtextually advances via Fen's explanation contrasting Elara's embodied response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; metaphors like "ghost remember its own heartbeat" cohere in UV beat, varying rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silphium revival synthesizing extinction with limbic echo transforms memory trope; vial collision risks lyric payoff, inevitable in chemical fidelity CR.</comment>
