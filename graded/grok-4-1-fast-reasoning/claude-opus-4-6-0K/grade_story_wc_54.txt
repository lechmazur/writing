<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through engineering lens on architecture ("maze of intentions"); "functionally creative" trait enables pivotal sketching with acknowledged naivete as flaw and cost; final micro-choice to label/save file earns renunciation of mere assessment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to Charged Poise/CR closure; sextant discovery anchors orientation early; cost legible in "proposals died in committee" paralleled by builders' "foolish" act, reconfiguring potential without decisive plot act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting's dormant flows (rainwater, geothermal) constrain and enable sketches, mirroring internal state via "reef absorbs shipwrecks"; micro-setting (sextant) charges final image; sensory hierarchy (silence as "atmospheric pressure") reflects engineer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Internal stake (reimagine vs. failure inevitability) signaled early, tightens texturally via sextant pivot to "equations for hope"; agency in sketching forecloses official role with felt cost (naivete admission); pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection via flows emerges organically from particulars (redirected water/heat/memory); final image ("carrying angles between what was fixed and what was possible") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (reads eras in "geometry," prioritizes "load-bearing walls"); rhythmic modulation (short sentences in silence beats) heightens wonder; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels (e.g., "She slipped it into her jacket pocket" punctuates discovery); metaphors coherent ("cathedral of transit," "blood through a body on life support") enhance without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport decay and engineering hope transforms tropes (forgotten relic to viable future); risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes via sextant reprise; inevitable in hindsight from early "maze" setup.</comment>
