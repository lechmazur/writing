<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to spin prophecy into possibility roots consistently in her trade, embodied through fingertip charges from buttons; final ledger addition earns change with foreclosed path of mere prevention. Interiority concrete via grandmother's sayings anchoring present sorting. Lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices under night-long pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorting density builds pattern spiral, tightening to dawn realization and jar-speaking CR with conceptual cost—"The prophecy did not vanish. It softened." Orientation anchors immediately in warehouse entry. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring buttons/jar constrain choices (sorting, speaking) and charge final image of sealed jar/ledger beside drawers; textures (bone cold, brass hum) filter via turner POV. Sensory hierarchy urgent in night work narrowing to pricks/emotional charges. Cliffs/echo mirror internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy) signaled early, Accumulative escalation via pattern emergence by dawn forecloses prevention option, forcing stance crystallization in speaking—"questions could be lived with." Cost legible in softened prophecy and night labor felt through hands. Agency in cataloging drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen pattern enabling possibility emerges organically from buttons/echo events, reweighted in final "cliffs...still deciding what they wanted to become" without moral state. Subtext in layered echo voices invites ambiguity on fate's fixity. Protagonist arc inextricable from shared wisdom growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in turner-noticing (button charges, spiral patterns); rhythmic control modulates from thick silence to resonant hum. Voice texture distinct in syntax evoking fabric-folding time. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "Pearl buttons...glow...remembering ballrooms"); varied rhythm accelerates in dawn pattern reveal, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent/patterned (spirals, folding), no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons-as-moments, jar-echo prophecy transform familiar fate trope into turner logic; risk in Accumulative discovery cadence heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable premise integrity to closure image of growing wisdom.</comment>
