<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines via chain link handling and embodied weeping; motivation rooted in navigation past compels endurance, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal chamber moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure: chamber realization reconfigures provincial knowledge with conceptual cost of "simpler religion," legible in final image of ongoing learning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Benthic city and crystal membrane constrain anchor metaphors while charging impossible starlight image; sensory pulse/hum filters through navigation POV without tourist excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn alien nav) deepens accumulatively via edge geometry to weep-tightening, forcing renunciation of old limits; cost felt in provincial reframing, though no live opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unfolded horizons emerge organically from diagrams/sky reveal, offering resonant non-literal answer in final chamber image that reweights seafaring premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with navigation-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation builds revelation texture without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied syntax, with purposeful poetic rhythm elevating accumulative closure untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alien edge geometry synthesizes deep-sea first contact with multidimensional nav ingenuity; risk-taking in refracted stars heightens stakes organically.</comment>
