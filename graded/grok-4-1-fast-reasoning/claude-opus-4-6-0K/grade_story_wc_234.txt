<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between precision and romanticism drives micro-choices like naming furnaces and using the shell; Cael's whisper earns the final resolve palette with vulnerability cost. Final sphere press reveals earned presence shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure; nautilus as template tightens prior failures into "one dense, irreducible point," with legible cost of absence/memory. Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nexus vents and twilight inversion constrain extraction timing; nautilus shell as micro-setting charges closure image by templating spiral light. Sensory selection (amber/rose embers, salt skin) reflects alchemist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bottle presence) signaled early; return method deepens via Accumulative cadence, foreclosing straight-line approach with 16-failure cost. Agency in flask uncap forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Presence-as-return theme emerges from particulars like columella curl and Cael's whisper; final sphere image reweights premise non-literally, embracing absence cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (measuring love letters, ember-breathing); rhythmic prose modulates to lyrical intensity at "light thickened," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; figurative layers (palette colors, photon corridors) cohere without muddle. No loops; closure line rhythm recharges motifs cleanly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy with nautilus geometry transforms presence trope; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via return method.</comment>
