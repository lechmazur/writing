<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Della's escalating offers/threats/appeal reveal hierarchy of values; playback tears earn handover with embodied cost. Maren's steadfast calm forces Della's tactical shifts, altering relationship state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: false starts densify to truce, playback cadence shift reconfigures opposition into Charged Poise RR. Handover ("placed it in Della's hands") lands closure with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pier rot and water seepage constrain timeframe/choices; watch fob as recurring micro-object charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (silences, brine) reflects Della's runner heritage bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart sale) signaled para 1, textural escalation via deepening hush/truce narrows to playback agency turning emotional options. Cost felt in tears/vulnerability charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust's silent break emerges from recording/playback particulars, Della's line ("It just stops") reweights without statement. Final dual-hold image answers non-literally with ghost/cost resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rhythm of silences); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (refusals build pressure). Rhythmic diction modulates from tense commerce to intimate hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels without loops; read-aloud rhythm breathes with negotiation beats. Opening/final lines recharge motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wax cylinder betrayal in hush market transforms artifact-sale trope via sound/silence angle; quiet handover risks bold emotional synthesis.</comment>
