<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solitary POV shines with concrete interiority and sensory embodiment; motivation to collect textures compels precise micro-choices like noting the hum stutter, earning her routine's endurance. No internal conflict impulses act simultaneously in scene, missing 9+ test. Final consecration reveals hierarchy of values with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in descent carrying "textures it would never know," with conceptual cost of solitary invention legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in climb/path; one tightening via stutter-to-upheaval translation narrows invented history's rhythm. Pattern taught from first silence signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and lamp constrain routine (switchbacks, plateau center) and charge final image (sun clears ridge, lamp hums redundantly). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: stationer notes "gold-leaf thumbnail," dew refraction mirroring craft. Micro-setting (thumbnail dew) evolves causally, filters through textural bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect temporal textures) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum stutter forcing "minor upheaval" in chronicle, reweighting empire's fall. Agency in charting/translation forecloses real history path with felt isolation cost. Escalation density-driven, cost unmistakable in "histories it would never know."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (sensory invention > remembered past) emerges organically from particulars like stutter-flood, refracted dew; final gold-press gesture offers resonant CR answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/dawn tension lingers with ambiguity of "better fiction." Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (textural precision: "crunch of frost," "mineral scent") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from climb's hush to dawn's hum. Voice texture distinct in syntax evoking stationery craft. No elision or POV slips; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "hum stuttered twice, then steadied" advances plot/texture/theme). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (sediment, refract) pattern-taught without muddle in peak charting beat. Propulsion matches scene: steady build to sun-clearing cadence.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stationer's gold craft + bonsai labyrinth + hum-charted fictions transforms routine into conceptual CR; risk in lyric accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable particulars (stutter-election, dew-empire) make turns inevitable. Bold premise commits fully.</comment>
