<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief/joy in Maren's return and performance; motivation rooted in father's silence-mapping compels collaboration and climax signing. Contradictory impulses (freedom in erasure vs. luminous grief) act in scene via camera-framing and performance choice. Minor slip in overt "grief so luminous it almost resembled joy" but doesn't touch closure; final endurance of silence as music feels earned with cost of rusty voice/unrecognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pier signing to collaboration to performance closure. Orientation anchored in first para (Maren on moonlit pier, forgotten returnee). Charged Poise CR in final camera press reconfigures silence as "architectural, mapped and magnificent" with conceptual cost of unseen music. One tightening via Clement's rhythms advice narrows to pier performance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor/pier constrains performance stage, moonlight charges hand gestures into "language and lightning." Camera as micro-setting frames stillness, evolves to notation, charges final shutter. Sensory selective (silver water, amber lights, lapping signed); POV-biased toward silence patterns. No slips; environment shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt music via silence-mapping) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to performance under Textural lens. Agency in signing/collaboration forecloses "erased" isolation with relational cost (rusty voice, unrecognition). Cost legible in "grief so luminous"; one deepening via Clement forces public crystallization. Minor abstractness in stakes but pressure coheres to charged end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (silence/music translation) emerges from signing, camera-framing, performance without statement; final image non-literally answers via "capturing everything" in nothing. Subtext in Clement's whispers bridges worlds; joyful sorrow in crowd cry/laugh layers complexity. Recurring light/hands reweight premise organically; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in unseen music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV on Maren; perceptual signature in silence-architecture noticing (e.g., "cupped hands hold rain"). Lyric rhythm modulates to performance intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Clement's whisper recognizes signing grammar). No head-hopping; diction biased to luminous patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies poetically without monotony; high density in gestures ("fingers into something between language and lightning"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors but consistent/patterned, no loops/muddle at closure. Propulsion builds to final image clarity; zero scaffold, precise verbs (stilled hands, lowered).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Deaf signing as visual symphony in forgotten harbor; camera-no-film transforms relic into notation/closure image. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens silence stakes organically. No derivatives; irreplaceable premise angle on music in body, not ear.</comment>
