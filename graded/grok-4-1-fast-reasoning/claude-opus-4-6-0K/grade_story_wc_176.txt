<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via casting metaphors and embodied guilt-forgiveness arc; final weeping earned by prior micro-choices in rebraiding under past failure's shadow. Contradictory impulses (unworthiness vs. honest hands) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from braid unwinding to voices echoing; Charged Poise closure in sanctum-filling sounds with legible emotional cost in "wept with the specific grief." Orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora/ice constrains tuning choices via resonance feedback; recurring rope/scrap as micro-setting charges final melt image, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (name preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via light-guided braids narrowing error options; agency in patient rebraiding, cost felt in tears and melt foreclosing silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-structure emerges organically from rope/organ parallel; final voices/melt offers resonant non-literal answer to preservation's cost, reweighting destruction-creation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory-casting filters ("coaxing form from molten metal"); rhythmic control modulates from precise work to emotional peak without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from setup to climax; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "veins of molten color") taught early pays off in resonance without muddle or loops in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax/organ encoding into rope-memory premise transforms preservation trope; risk in solo experiential closure heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via wire vibration cue.</comment>
