<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between lifelong motion and sudden anchoring act in scene via weeping and deliberate star-dances; final fledging earned by glyph accumulation with cost of earthly severance. Interiority concrete and embodied in "invisible mooring... fastened to bedrock."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of glyphs building to RR closure (rising as fledging, basin reflection reconfigures stillness/motion); orientation anchored early in exile walk to garden. Cost legible in "anchor... dissolve" and garden darkening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden and basin constrain dances/specks and charge final image (reflection as "proof"); sensory gaps (starlight pools, cricket silences) selectively mirror transformation. Micro-setting (granite rim speck) enables pivotal glyph touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoid erasure via becoming) tightens accumulatively through speck-to-glyph cadence shift narrowing to fledge; agency in persistent dances forecloses return with cost of garden's darkening and distant tide weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stillness/motion as "stanzas in the same unfinished verse" emerges organically from tide-to-star dances and basin image reweighting premise without moralizing. Final reconfiguration answers exile/remembrance question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in gap-observations and rhythmic syntax ("swell... summoned carried the rhythm"); voice modulates lyric density purposefully under transformation pressure, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythms and concrete images (e.g., "rip current into a waltz"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (gaps/glyphs) without muddle at peak fledging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia ban, tide-dancing, and glyph-fledging transforms exile trope via gap-grammar and cosmic verse; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
