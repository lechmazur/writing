<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to rescue arts compels specific micro-choices like using the lens and arguing for flour, rooted in consistent cultured traits; embodied dread as "rosewater poured over something rotting" reveals particular interiority. Lacks on-scene contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning on retrospective summary over live tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from decline ("children stopped singing") to revival pattern, culminating in Conceptual Repricing at "We were historically oriented people... refusal to disappear" with felt cost of persistent dread. Orientation anchored in opening lines; one tightening via bread ceremony narrows despair options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity (roar, moss "velvet alphabets," damp seepage) reflects POV priorities, constraining choices (rationed flour, fading frescoes); recurring lens and oven glow charge final image as "their stage now."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts vs soft despair) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lens lesson to bread ceremony tightening, forcing trade-off with rations; agency in teaching/arguing forecloses erasure path with dread's lingering cost legible in "faintly nauseating" persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stubborn cultural endurance emerges organically from particulars like lettered loaves and emerald glow; final image ("make our own sweetness... refusal to disappear") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting displacement without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (historical lens on "silent grammar of oil paintings," caves as cathedrals) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to charged closure, POV stable with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "flour — a precious, rationed store"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, metaphors consistent (rosewater dread threads without muddle).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of refugee arts revival via lettered bread and Hapsburg lens transforms displacement trope; risk in reflective accumulative structure heightens refusal's stakes organically.</comment>
