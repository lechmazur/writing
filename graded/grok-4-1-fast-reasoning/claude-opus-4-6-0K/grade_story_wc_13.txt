<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in sparing pendant use versus free spending under deadline pressure, earning the humming choice; interiority particular via illustrator's precision on vanishing things.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density buildup to lattice discovery and CR closure ("pendant cooled... future... thinner"); orientation anchored early in narrowboat/canals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Junction of seven waterways as infinity loop constrains discovery and mirrors pendant, charging final image of resuming water; sensory hierarchy favors sound geometries reflecting POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens via giant's nap window narrowing to lattice stress point; agency in humming forces release with legible time cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final sketching of "empty space where captive music had been" reweights freedom's loss non-literally, emerging from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with illustrator's perceptual signature ("sketched furiously," "drew the lattice's structure"); rhythmic modulation heightens echo release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; purposeful figurative control ("time thicken... like honey") propels without muddle in peak lattice beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of sound-creatures, time-sculpting, giant bedrock transforms tropes; rooftop canals/echo larvae feel inevitable and risky.</comment>
