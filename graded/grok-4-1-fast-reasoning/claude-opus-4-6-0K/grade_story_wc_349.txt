<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to map story origins via absence shapes clear, intensifying choices like logging the spiral void; embodied via pulsing parole band. Interiority concrete and particular, with flaws (own wiped slate) complicating endurance. Hairline slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building density from customer recap to journal spiral to final charged poise of "stylus ready... one void closer to the source." Closure reconfiguration legible with cost in her fragmented self ("woman made of removed pieces"). Orientation anchored early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard and cloud sea constrain reflection via prismatic drifts mirroring voids; moonlight fills grooves, charging final image. Sensory selection POV-biased (quantified absences). Recurrent journal/stylus as micro-setting shapes logging choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin mapping) signaled early, deepened by rare spiral void that reweights architecture of self. Accumulative tightening narrows via catastrophic attachment recognition. Cost felt in paroled endurance, legible at "freedom was borrowed light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative origins via forgetting emerges organically from absence shapes to final "fragmented cartography," reweighting premise without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in voids composing wholes, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (quantifying lacunae, spirals); diction/rhythm lyrical yet precise, modulating reflective poise. No head-hopping or withholding; voice embodies quantifying mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied rhythm (e.g., "void with motion, an absence that still churned"). Metaphors cohere without muddle; propulsion aligns with lull cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-erasure as quantifiable voids mapping origins; transforms trope via journal grooves and spiral. Risky lyric world-building heightens stakes organically.</comment>
