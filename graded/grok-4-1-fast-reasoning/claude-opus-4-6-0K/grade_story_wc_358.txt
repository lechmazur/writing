<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in concrete lines like "facts were hard. The meaning was vapor," rooting motivation in traits; final endurance of loneliness as cost earns the change without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensor data density builds to convergence map; closure Charged Poise in saving file and fog-door image reconfigures death with loneliness cost legible at "valuable and what made her lonely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Containers as wind canyons constrain every sensor placement and charge final image; fog's "hazy precision" mirrors stakes, with sensory hierarchy via professional notice of gusts and salt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to map wind for foresight tightens via junction gust data overlaying crane path, forcing renunciation of official narrative; cost in her isolation felt on-page without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges via vectors meeting, resonant in Derry's patch and final refusal to let death repeat; non-literal answer in fog closing reweights particulars without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in wind-as-killer diction and rhythmic modulation ("hair whipping sideways") biases noticing; stable close-third POV with voice as character, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "forty percent amplification would have pushed gusts here past thirty"; varied rhythm propels without loops, metaphors integrated like "pendulum work."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind-modeling as foresight crucible transforms accident-probe trope; risk in lonely professional arc heightens stakes organically.</comment>
