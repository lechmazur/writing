<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (choosing safety over song) act in scene via backstory-cued micro-choices like noticing the bolt ring; final singing earned by guilt's embodied toll, foreclosing silence with irreplaceable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoloration sparks causal chain to turret discovery and Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "one voice held against the winter," reconfiguring survival as endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Piano bench as micro-setting constrains climax (tilted seat prompts sitting/singing) and charges final image; sensory details (radiators' "mechanical prayers," ice-cold wood) filter through Oren's mute devotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt-fueled silence vs. voicing survival) signaled early, tightens via bench discovery narrowing to renunciation; agency in singing forecloses prior stasis with "unbearable courage" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of cracked note answers "cost of safety" non-literally, reweighting silence as "wrong memorial" through particulars like tilted bench; ambiguity lingers in "never fill the space of forty-three."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (tasks as "genuflection"); rhythmic control heightens via short, fractured sentences at "He opened his mouth," eliding backstory into present seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images without loops; varied rhythm peaks in "a single, fractured tone that cracked against the turret walls," no figurative muddle or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conservatory-turned-clinic under guilt's lens; risk in quiet Accumulative closure via bench transforms survivor trope, inevitable in hindsight from bolt cue.</comment>
