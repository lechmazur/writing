<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in testable belief about heartbeats as maps drives ritual choices; embodied patience (knees in frozen ground, steady fingers) reveals character under cold's pressure. Earned endurance in seal forecloses doubt with physical cost (stained hands, curved spine). Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but coherence suits resolute focalizer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds from listening to seal, culminating in Charged Poise RR where copper warms and map emerges legible. Orientation anchors early (crater orchard, solstice). Cost undeniable in "ridges and valleys... geography of longing" reconfiguring her prior map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Subarctic crater's mineral walls trap safekept starlight as resource constraining ritual (absorbed by paper); withered roots supply living pulse. Cold channels pressure patience physically, charges final image of starlight persisting post-exhale. Sensory hierarchy (breath hangs, starlight trembles) reflects alchemist's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture orchard's heartbeat map) signaled early, tightens texturally via pattern density to ignition/ignition seal narrowing to success under lens. Agency in deliberate placements/endurance forecloses failure path with embodied cost (immobility in killing cold). One deepening sufficient; moral calculus in preserving vanishing light adds depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mapping longing emerges organically from heartbeat geography and flash-paper's preserve/vanish tension; orchard's map reweights her dedication without statement. Final image ("tracing... the road the roots had dreamed") offers resonant CR answer to seeking amid deadness. Subtext in grandmother's plate ties personal history to cosmic patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (rhythms over sound, starlight as rainwater); diction/rhythm modulate from poised listening to ignited brilliance. Lyrical compression taught early (pulse translation) pays off legible at closure. No head-hopping; voice particular to alchemist's conviction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (crater as cupped palm → starlight pools) without muddle, rhythm varies (short pauses mimic placement). No loops/scaffold; every line advances texture to seal. Minor figurative density in opener purposeful for atmospheric teaching, not overwriting in ritual peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: flash-paper etching heartbeats via safekept starlight in ritual crater transforms preservation trope organically. Risky stillness heightens ingenuity without gimmick; final map of roots' dream inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in pulse-as-map premise.</comment>
