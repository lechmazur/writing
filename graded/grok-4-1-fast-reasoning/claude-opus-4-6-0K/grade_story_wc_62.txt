<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to trace collective grief drives chisel shift to spiral carving, embodied in controlled breathing amid monarchs; interiority particular without therapy-speak; earned change via ribbon causality, though grandmother's directive slightly shortcuts internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from ribbon discovery through poem-guided dusks to CR closure in spiral tracing and perpetual conversation realization; Marguerite's fading and migration end provide felt cost in final image; orientation anchored early in greenhouse at dusk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's rippled glass, ferns, and dusk copper smoke constrain meditative carving by fading light and enable monarch settling; recurring butterflies charge final gyre image, mirroring grief's widening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief's shape signaled early tightens accumulatively via weekly spectral deepening of poems, narrowing unanswered chisel stasis; agency in retracing forecloses old methods with visible carving cost as migration ends.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as endless conversation emerges organically from ribbon custom and spiral; final gyre image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting absence into connection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with lyrical perceptual signature in poetic noticing like "thundering calm"; diction/rhythm modulate meditative intensity cleanly; spectral dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid, coherent metaphors (steam specter, widening gyre) propels without loops or scaffolds; syntax varies for ear-test rhythm, peaking in spiral-finger run.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poem-ribbon map, spectral greenhouse guidance, and grief spiral transforms carving trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
