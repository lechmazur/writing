<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harmon's motivation roots deeply in grandfather's loss and failed fertilizers, compelling bird-guided persistence with embodied grit ("dirt-black hands"); contradictory belief in pacts versus soil refusal acts in every planting beat. Final sprouts earn closure choice via prior causality. No unearned epiphanies or stock traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reef death to jetty bloom to sprouts, reconfiguring reclamation premise (CR) with cost in encroaching sea ("the sea kept coming"). Orientation anchors by para 2; no shards exceed scope. Closure image ("sprouts did not answer, but they grew") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty and battlefield constrain choices (tidal paste, fish carcasses carried to hardpan); twilight "pulsed with impossible garden" charges final image. Sensory selection (violet/green glow, bruised fruit light) filters via Harmon's eye, mirroring internal softening. No white-room; spatial choreography clear across hill-road-jetty-field.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim violence-remembering soil) signaled early, tightens via bird-call method shifting from compost failures to jetty gifts, narrowing to dusk plantings. Cost felt in endurance ("no passengers") and sea threat; agency in carrying/mixing/pressing forecloses old future. Escalation coheres accumulatively without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of submerged pacts emerges via seeds/birds/languages, resolved non-literally in sprouts growing amid grief ("some version of the future that might have included gentleness"). Final image reweights narrow vastness without moral; ambiguity lingers in sea's advance. No sermonizing or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (dead tongues "taste like iron," bird calls as coordinates); diction/rhythm modulate to bruised dusk intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; voice distinct in syntax reflecting coachman's ruts. Prose texture controlled under persistence pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "salt-stunted vines threaded... glowed violet and green" packs setting/atmosphere/action). Rhythm varies (short punches in planting: "He pressed the mixture into the hardpan at dusk"); metaphors coherent, no overwriting in peak sprouts beat. Propulsion peaks at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman hauling ecosystem gifts via Sumerian whispers and whimbrel hymns transforms eco-reclamation trope; bird calls as pre-Sumerian coordinates inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in dead languages/blooms amid decay heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivatives; singular vision.</comment>
