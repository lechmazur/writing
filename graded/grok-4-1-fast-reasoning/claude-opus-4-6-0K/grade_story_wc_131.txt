<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory fear of "being seen wrong" versus notebook decision earn final renunciation of hiding with exile cost; embodied sense memory in tape inhale particularizes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via discovery density to charged poise closure in palm vibration, reconfiguring visibility options with felt discovery cost; orientation anchored early in crawl space drop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pipe chases constrain hidden movements and charge final desk wait; dawn "blue so deep it felt almost audible" hierarchies sensory detail to Maren's marginal life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Notebook placement as agency-driven tightening under accumulative lens forecloses invisibility path, escalating to undeniable exile risk in sustained wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tape fragments and chair-straightening build emergent tenderness-as-belonging theme; vibration answers visibility question via resonant reconfiguration without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "sapphire hush" and "chemical sweetness" sustains single-POV bias; rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "kindly and methodical" logging propels to vibration close; varied rhythm and purposeful figures avoid artifacts in peak hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tapes-as-nervous-system synthesis transforms squatter trope into fresh belonging angle; crawl-space poise risks quiet closure payoff inevitably.</comment>
