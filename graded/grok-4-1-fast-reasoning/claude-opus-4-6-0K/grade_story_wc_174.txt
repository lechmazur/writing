<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's urbane traits shine in concrete interiority (thumb along notches triggers epiphany) and micro-choices under pressure (lettering accusations verbatim), earning the serene reversal; secondary characters apply relevant pressure without muddling POV. Final renunciation of authority forecloses their prior path with felt cost. Group peripheral but choreographed clearly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds to half-lit epiphany ("the question was never whether...") and CR closure in reversal decision, reweighting ethics with cost (handing away baton-like stick). Orientation anchored early (dome post-argument). Single scene, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dome's parabolic hush and slashed moonlight constrain staging (pedestal as stage, paper backdrop) and charge final image (empty dome "collecting signals"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (mineral-tasting quiet). Harbor externalized via external image, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant ethical stake signaled early via argument recap; accumulative deepening in epiphany narrows options to reversal, with agency in "give them the stick" and cost ("It might be terrible"). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of power reversal emerges organically from lettering transcript and stick-handover, answered non-literally by final debris-streaking sky (illuminating "shapes already there"). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "might be terrible."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with calligraphic perceptual signature ("gorgeous, trembling script"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You want the audience...?"). Rhythm modulates hush to propulsion; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in epiphany); metaphors coherent/patterned (smoke refusing to rise, dome swallowing noise). Zero loops; propulsion peaks in "They packed the puppets."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher's artistry flips puppet ethics via live audience lettering; risky lyric tone transforms tropes (epiphany in dome) without gimmick, heightening closure charge.</comment>
