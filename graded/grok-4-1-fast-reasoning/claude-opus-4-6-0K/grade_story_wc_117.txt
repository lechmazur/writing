<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's adaptive micro-choices, like offering the curl wordlessly, reveal hierarchy of values under pressure of Jonah's silence. Jonah's embodied caution and breakthrough earn change via prior signals read "like a sailor reads wind." Contradictory patience vs. force impulses act in the eclipse sharing; final link forecloses isolation path with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to totality's pattern break, with melody passing as tightening that changes knowledge of Jonah's capacity. Closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in his rusty sentence and shared notes, cost legible in wet eyes and voice texture. Orientation anchored early; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sagebrush, thinning light "like watercolor left in rain," and temperature drop constrain timing and charge totality's corona flare. Juniper roots' "dreaming" motif mirrors slow wonder, evolving with coyote yip and resuming sage scent to frame final heartbeat tap. Micro-setting (blanket, kalimba) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture Jonah's voice via wonder) signaled early, deepens via eclipse-timed curl offering narrowing guardedness. Agency in thumbed notes forces relational trade-off; cost unmistakable in rusty voice after months' silence, charging poise without resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges implicitly from curl, eclipse firefly notes, and bird-kalimba echo, reweighting silence as bridge. Final image ("song neither had finished writing") offers non-literal answer to wonder's nurture without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited perceptual signature biases to signals, embodied states; diction/rhythm modulates from thinning light to hanging note "like a firefly." Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden: Jonah's query rusty, Elara's reply crystallizes theme. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sense/action (e.g., "crescent... narrowed to a wire. Then totality."). Varied rhythm breathes with eclipse cadence; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Opening anchors stakes; final recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Solar eclipse as therapy crucible via kalimba-curl synthesis transforms muted grief trope into ordinary magic's fresh angle. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes via heartbeat tap; inevitable in hindsight from ridge's dreaming roots priming wonder.</comment>
