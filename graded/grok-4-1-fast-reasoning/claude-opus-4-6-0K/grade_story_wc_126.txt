<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in unfinished score and playing fragments act on-page; final smile earns stasis with cost of unrelieved loneliness, embodied in solitary hearing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from hush buildup to Charged Poise/CR in apple drop; cost legible in "only Maren heard it," reweighting silence without resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and wrecks constrain sound propagation ("glass walls... caught the sound"); final apple in orchard charges image, mirroring internal unfinished beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of filling silence tightens via fragment play over full score; agency in unbinding forecloses resolution path with felt cost of perpetual hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges implicitly through score, fragments, bowl; final "beauty lived" reweights hush non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with acoustic perceptual signature ("shape of the space... density"); rhythmic control heightens hush texture without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("notes fell into the mendicant's bowl of the night"); zero loops, metaphors cohere (firelight sharpening notes), read-aloud rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh acoustic hush post-rainforest synthesis feels inevitable; risk of lyric stasis pays off in apple CR without gimmick.</comment>
