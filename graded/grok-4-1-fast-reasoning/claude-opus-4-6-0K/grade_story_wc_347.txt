<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant duty hatred shown concretely in opening ("hated every single one") contrasts precise micro-choices like muttering measurements and nut ritual, earning closure endurance with curse's felt limit. No stock epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging. Families' arrival tests but doesn't deepen due to brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blueprint discovery → nut planning → four-hour work → guidance, with frost as motivated deadline tightening to Charged Poise closure in nut's final "period" image bearing duty's conceptual cost. Orientation anchors instantly; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical birds' "glass eyes clicking" and curse's no-touch rule constrain choices throughout; salt air's "slap of grace" charges harbor emergence. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (measurements, sap); frost evolution causal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost deadline signals dominant stake early, agency in indirect work narrows options with curse constraint; visible cost in effort and "graceless" passage forecloses switchback deaths. One tightening via blueprint payoff coheres under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Graceless beauty theme emerges implicitly from cursed orchard/no-touch duty to safe guidance; final nut image reconfigures inheritance as "sentence finally written" without moralizing. Particulars like birds and sap avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in exactitude ("seventeen meters"); rhythmic control peaks in montage ("kicked doors... sang low notes"). Minimal dialogue natural and sparse; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("breath fogging... tucked their wings"); varied syntax, no loops or scaffolds. Final line's image rhythm recharges opening without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, mech birds, no-touch curse, and nut ritual transforms tropes organically; blueprint payoff feels inevitable from particulars, risking "graceless" ingenuity.</comment>
