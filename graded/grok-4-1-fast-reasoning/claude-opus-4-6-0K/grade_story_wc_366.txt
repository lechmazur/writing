<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. felt pressure behind sternum) act in scene; final cairn choice earned by prior observations with ongoing commitment cost. Reticent trait shown through silent actions, not labels. Interiority embodied and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: cairn discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure in her cairn and chain continuation, with felt cost of chosen isolation. Orientation anchored early (Maren's history, Duskpoint). No causality breaks; pattern taught via first cairn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern room shadows and fractured lens constrain choices (oil access, cairn reading); sea glass charges final image as pocketed warmth. Sensory details (brine, iron, humming grief) selective via POV bias. Micro-setting (gallery railing) guides protective act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore/protect light) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cairn sequences narrowing to realization and relighting agency. One deepening (understands protective haunting) forces stance crystallization with visible cost (her silent vow). Cost legible in "every two weeks after that."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared prayer for safety emerges organically from stone chain and light; final cairn reweights without moral, embracing ambiguity of living/dead dialogue. Resonance from particulars like sea glass shift. No tidy resolution or statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cataloguing suffering tenderly). Rhythmic control modulates from observant to charged ("radiance exceeded the flame"). Purposeful compression in stone messages pays off at closure; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful ("light seen through water") without muddle in peaks. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: protective ghost via stone semaphore transforms lighthouse trope organically. Risk in quiet, ongoing closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Cairn language as haunting feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
