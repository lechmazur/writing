<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional ceramic intuition ties potter traits to micro-choices like reading warped wood and lantern light, earning the CR realization; contradictory impulses in initial wrong question vs. final reconfiguration compel higher-stakes presence. Internal conflict embodied without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of erasure shows earned stasis with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thrumming deepens density, layers timelines for CR closure with legible conceptual cost in "stacked like clay coils" image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (potter, oasis, wasteland). Single scene, no shards, lens taught early via sun patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Oasis constrains choices (kneel low per wind/smoke, hives frame intuition); lantern glass charges final image as carry-home vessel. Sensory hierarchy potter-specific (light crawling skin). Setting evolves via thrumming visions without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand resistance) signaled early, tightens via thrumming visions under Accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance choice with cost in fragility recognition; agency in lantern turn forecloses erasure path. One deepening suffices, charges Charged Poise at kneel.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-anchored persistence emerges from visions' particulars (water left, seedling), reweighting premise in final "small mercies stacked" without statement; resonant CR answers question non-literally. No moralizing, ambiguity in timelines lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature potter-biased (clay memory analogies); rhythm modulates from patient to thrumming intensity. Purposeful compression in visions legible under Accumulative lens, no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light bent... layered like transparencies"); zero loops, varied rhythm passes ear test, metaphors coherent (phototropic kindness). Propulsion peaks clean in thrumming without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timelines/oasis/kindness via potter lens transforms post-apocalyptic trope; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from early sun-arc. No template echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
