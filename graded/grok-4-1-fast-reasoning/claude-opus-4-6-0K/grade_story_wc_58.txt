<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the obituary-writing scene, where Maren critiques her own "projecting presence" while embodying it; final endurance to stay is earned by prior absences' cost, scaled perfectly to length. Interiority concrete via thread's ridge and garden's "lonesome splendor." No safety-hedging; flaws complicate without tidy arcs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to self-obituary realization, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"She stayed, and the autumn stayed with her"—with legible cost in "buried nowhere" desire. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (island, last ship, garden). One meaningful deepening suffices; no micro turns disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden and thread as micro-setting constrain choice: isolation post-ship forces rooted presence, charging final image where "shadows lengthened" and rose defies frost mirror internal ache. Sensory details (decaying chrysanthemums, moss emerald) selective via POV urgency, integrated into reflection without stalls. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wandering vs. rooted healing) signaled early, tightens texturally via obituary's deepening that forecloses departure with felt cost—"justification and peace were different countries." Agency in writing/renunciation; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, one reversal sufficient. No abstract stakes; isolation clock viscerally narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of presence-as-leaving emerges organically from obit particulars ("touched...intimately...direction of leaving"); final image reconfigures as non-literal answer—she becomes presence—reweighting absences without moralizing. Subtext in thread's silk connecting imagined/decaying beauty; ambiguity lingers in "ache that was also an opening."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: notices "latticed shadows...like breath," biased toward healing geography. Lyrical rhythm modulates from wandering summary to present compression under realization; diction controlled, voice as character via wound thread's intimacy. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to cues like ship horns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "She wound it around her finger now...feeling how the thread connected"), propulsion varies with scene—lyric expansion to tight closure image. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; rhythm read-aloud natural, openings diverse. Minor overwriting in garden motifs purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise transforms trope of wanderer via obituaries-for-living ingenuity, synthesized with thread's paradise/decay into inevitable self-obit turn. Fresh angle on healing geography; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivatives; particulars (Hokkaido fisherwoman) personalize universals.</comment>
