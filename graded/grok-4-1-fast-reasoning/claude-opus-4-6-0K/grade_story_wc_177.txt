<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between foresight/hindsight and present awareness act simultaneously during the storm, compelling the transcendence choice earned by dream-parsing and directive decay. Interiority particular via time-seam metaphors and embodied trembling hands. Final renunciation forecloses prior horizons with felt cost in raw presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream patterns and directive corruption densify toward CR closure: "She let go of both horizons" reconfigures time-seam premise with undeniable cost in storm's fist. Orientation anchored early in bunker/forest. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vines "breathed audibly" and "tore free," constraining climax action and charging final image of green conquest. Sensory hierarchy (vine-smell, dripping dark, thunder) narrows with storm urgency. Bunker evolves causally from organic-softened concrete to groaning stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve path-choice) signaled early via directive/wafer, escalates accumulatively as storm bleeds present tense, forcing seal-press agency. Tightening via directive's final line narrows options; cost legible in "raw, uninterpreted" presence amid whipping vines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of path as walking emerges organically from dreams ("You were the door before you were the walker") and archives flood, resonant in final image reweighting seams-to-fabric without moral. Complexity in playful decay avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in time slippage ("tomorrow's rain pooling... yesterday's moss"). Rhythm modulates from meditative to propulsive storm ("fist made of sky"). Prose texture distinct via spectra-split light and breathing vines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "decay felt precisely playful" advances plot/character/tone); varied rhythm accelerates in storm without loops. Figurative language purposeful and consistent, no muddle in peak ("vines tore free and whipped").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-displaced guardian and mutating directive transforms post-apoc tropes via resonance-selection premise. Risky lyric transcendence inevitable from established patterns, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
