<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steadily curious trait drives all actions with embodied emotion peaking in "laughed, and the laugh had tears in it," earning the descent; internal conflict subtle in curiosity vs. dissolution risk; no safety-hedging, flaws fuel persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from signal decoding to kaleidoscope breakthrough to audible bell (RR/Charged Poise closure) with descent cost legible in spiraling image; orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea vapors ("burnt pennies and regret") and green sun constrain alloys and glider descent, charging final push-off; sensory hierarchy reflects curiosity (gears groaning, bell felt in body); micro-setting (arrow tip) enables climax scoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode signal) tightens via kaleidoscope transliteration, forcing descent trade-off; agency in building machine forecloses surface life with acid risk cost felt in "churned below, green and patient and terrible."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Endurance beneath dissolution emerges organically from yearning algorithm and bell's invitation, reweighted in final image of gears turning/acid dissolving/bell ringing without moralizing; complexity in stubbornness vs. inevitable corrosion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drunk philosopher," "longing made systematic") modulates with awe at breakthrough; stable third-limited POV biases toward mechanical curiosity; rhythmic compression heightens descent poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The gears turned. The kaleidoscope rotated. The arrow tip scored"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("world clearing its throat") even in peak bell-ring beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea workshops, yearning algorithm decoding via kaleidoscope transforms trope of quest into textural resonance; risk in descent premise heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
