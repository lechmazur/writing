<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist vividly embodied in workshop chaos and listening dedication; contradictory fear vs. need peaks in diary hesitation, earning closure realization with emotional cost in weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tuning densities build to diary gasp and CR closure ("Warm like a hand almost touching yours"); cost legible in reframed rejection, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop/open roof constrains tuning and charges fireworks image; sensory selectivity (tones to stars) mirrors internal hush, with diary as micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's silence) tightens via town hush + tuning into diary agency; one deepening forecloses misbelief with vulnerability cost in final catalog entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Empathy-through-silence emerges organically from parallel catalogs; final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant answer in "silence of being loved without knowing it."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (silence idioms) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, elision taught early via catalogs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors ("pressed cotton") without muddle; propulsion peaks in diary entries, zero loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh silence-catalog premise synthesizes listening tropes into CR payoff; risk in lyric accumulation feels inevitable, transforming mother-daughter silence organically.</comment>
