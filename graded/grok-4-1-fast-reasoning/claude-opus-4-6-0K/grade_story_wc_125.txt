<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in rope's tactile layers culminate in earned surrender; contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the uncoiling moment, revealing values hierarchy with visible cost. Ethically playful trait shown concretely in counter-question to being. Final ropeless tethering reconfiguration feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from walk to grotto encounter, pattern break at rope dissolution, CR closure via poem image reweighting freedom with surrender cost. Orientation anchored early (foothills grotto, seventh night). One tightening sufficient; cost legible in "dissolved into light."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta layers and starlight constrain revelation, charging final palm-press and poem with tactile centuries. Sensory selection (milk-sieve light, hemp fibers) POV-biased and purposeful. Micro-setting (clay wall) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture discovery) tightens via being's offer, narrowing to relic trade-off; agency in surrender forecloses path with on-page dissolution cost. Escalation as density increase under lens forces stance crystallization. Moral calculus (relic vs. revelation) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rope motif shifts from binding relic to time's braid, offering non-literal answer to freedom question in poem's "wisdom to choose which ones to tie." Emerges organically from particulars; final image recharges premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (texture obsession: "grain beneath her fingers," "coarse and warm"); voice poetic yet grounded in poet's idiom. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Depends on who's asking"); rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with metaphors cohesive (rope-time-clay braid); rhythm varies (short insight sentences peak at "Time was not a river"). No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in dissolution beat without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: energy beings as time-teachers transform rope myth into textural CR; counter-south migration risks bold defiance. Rope-time equivalence inevitable in hindsight; lyric risks heighten closure without gimmickry.</comment>
