<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority via scarf's "geography" and embodied warmth like "a hand feels when another hand has just released it"; sanely eccentric trait shown through emotional notes and literal belief, compelling search with earned endurance at model activation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure—"the space between the shelves seemed deeper"—reweighting linear reality with perceptual cost legible in final image; anchors clear early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic aisles and crochet models constrain project and charge final "curvature of the room"; patrons' hum as "low collective hum" mirrors internal resonance, selective details integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stories' dwelling place) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Bolyai discovery and scarf activation narrowing to infinite divergence; cost felt in deepened space foreclosing Euclidean limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative excess in hyperbolic planes emerges organically from particulars like "parallel lines diverge"; final "stories breathed" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in spatial sensations ("cinnamon" kitchen expanding); rhythmic prose modulates from study to warmth, distinct texture without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and zero loops; figurative language purposeful ("maps could chart the interior of feeling") without muddle in peak scarf beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog scarf memories, and narrative space feels inevitable; risk-taking in topological model integrates organically, transforming tropes boldly.</comment>
