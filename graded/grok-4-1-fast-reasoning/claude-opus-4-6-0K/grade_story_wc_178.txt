<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frugal traits shown concretely through mended robes and reed tools drive micro-choices like patient audiences, culminating in earned belief shift; contradictory impulses (empirical caution vs. sacred pull) act in the final hand-on-tile moment, compelling acceptance with visible cost to skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from tile observation to celestial mapping, landing CR closure in "She whispered the coordinates aloud... an acceptance" with conceptual cost of signing the covenant; single scene anchors orientation early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tile, schematics, and palace dust/starlight constrain choices (undisturbed study) and charge final image (hand on cool glaze under emerging stars); sensory hierarchy (astronomical bias ignores lavish details) integrates purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncloaking tile) signaled early tightens accumulatively to constellation revelation, narrowing empirical to devotional options; agency in mapping/acceptance forecloses disbelief with felt cost in "frugal enough to know that some offers do not come twice."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of devotion via precision emerges organically from tile-to-constellation path, answered non-literally in clasped hands image reweighting rational/sacred divide; no moralizing, complexity in ironic confirmation lingers via counter-reading of unanswered prayer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (schematic metaphors like "thread-maps," "celestial geometry") modulates rhythmically to charged poise; diction precise and voice-motivated, elevating without register drift in peak realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax accelerates from description to propulsion in "What emerged was not a single constellation but a sequence"; final line's image ("quiet certainty... document she did not know she had been asked to sign") resolves motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magic square as stellar covenant synthesizer transforms arithmetic trope into devotional encoding, risking ancient math-astronomy fusion that heightens stakes organically; fresh clasped-hands constellation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
