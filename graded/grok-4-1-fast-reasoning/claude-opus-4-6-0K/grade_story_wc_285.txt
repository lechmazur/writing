<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harlan's interiority shines through concrete perceptual bias and micro-choices like threading the needle amid fog's tangle, earning his declarative closure; contradictory endurance of layered noise vs. singular focus acts simultaneously without alternating summaries. Woman subsidiary but pressures via document without diluting drive. No unearned epiphanies; competence balanced by struggle with ambient complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sounds percolate to silt-like separation of layers, yielding CR closure when fog lifts post-listening—"The land is yours... crossing stays public"—with patience cost legible in needle's focus. Orientation anchored in para 1 (coachman at Sable Bend); single scene coherent, no shards. Lens taught early, unambiguous payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog-bound river constrains waiting and charges final lift as spindrift serenity, mirroring internal distillation; recurring gutters' tick/stop and heron call filter via Harlan's auditory bias, evolving causally. Needle as micro-setting tool enables focus under pressure. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to sounds in fog, no checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discern oldest deed layer) signaled early, tightens texturally as percolation deepens to "oldest promise... holds," narrowing to public-crossing renunciation with felt endurance cost in fog-sit. Agency via attentive stasis forecloses private claim. One decisive intensification suffices under lens; cost unmistakable in thinning mist post-declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Palimpsest theme emerges implicitly via fog-preserved oaths vs. scraped deeds, reweighted non-literally in final needle-thread/crossing-open image without moralizing. Subtext in Harlan's "fog does not lie" implies listening's cost yields essence. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in binding fog-memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in sound-percolation diction ("seep through... ink bleeds"); rhythmic control modulates from dense murk to serene exhale. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, advances revelation without exposition. No head-hopping; elision of deed details paid in on-page listening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rain gutters tick" builds time/atmosphere); varied rhythm breathes with percolation, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors coherent (palimpsest/silt/needle), purposeful without muddle in peak reveal. Propulsion peaks in fog-pale, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog-as-palimpsest memory with needle-distillation transforms ghost-story tropes into perceptual ingenuity; risk-taking in textural lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick. Final horses-forward image inevitable from auditory pattern. No derivatives; voice commits boldly to fog's logic.</comment>
