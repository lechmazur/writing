<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via "quiet pressure behind her sternum" embodiment and character-specific gift constraining choices; final endurance of holding the king earns change with isolation cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but act in humble rebellion vs. larger pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in grotto image ("town's unspoken words were shifting"); legible cost in her solitary listening reconfigures resignation. Orientation anchored early; shards cohere without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's "mineral veins" and magnetic pull charge final image, constraining Maren's attentive poise; cobalt mist recurs purposefully, mirroring internal states through selective sensory filter. Spatial choreography clear in window progression and quarry edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening town tightens accumulatively via window "hum" reaction narrowing to her heard "question mark"; agency in displays forces felt cost of tentative shift over surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-to-second-thought emerges organically from chess metaphors and final "something before hope"; resonant CR reweights prior resignation without moralizing, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of "hearing" unspoken via embodied knowing; rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure, diction biased to her empathetic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative layering ("frequency you felt in your teeth"); no loops or artifacts dull propulsion to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess rebellion and unspoken-hearing transforms decline trope; window displays and grotto king feel inevitable, risking lyric quiet for stakes-heightening ingenuity.</comment>
