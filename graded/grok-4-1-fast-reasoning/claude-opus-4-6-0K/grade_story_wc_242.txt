<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Particular interiority in cultivating estrangement as garden and purpose "to teach endings how to begin" compels final welcoming line; embodied emotions via tunnel hum and disc tone; micro-choices like holding disc to receiver reveal values with estrangement cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via pattern of wrong-number friendships building density to closure; conceptual repricing lands on-page in final call where "another ending folded over and became a beginning"; cost legible in perpetuated loop through dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's sweating copper and penny-taste air constrain isolation; glass disc as micro-setting charges closure image; sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's priorities, narrowing to hum and tone during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake in looping calls tightens accumulatively through ritual cadence and past examples; final agency in "Then you've reached exactly the right wrong number" crystallizes stance; deepening via new caller's six-year silence forecloses reconnection path with felt estrangement cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dislocation enabling honesty emerges from particulars like Tulsa boy and grout argument; final image reweights estrangement as generative loop without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in disc's looping tone carrying forward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in tunnel-as-garden bias; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "the air tasted like old pennies"; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful and coherent, enhancing closure hum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost operator premise with glass disc loops transforms isolation trope; bold accumulative lyricism risks quiet closure but heightens stakes via pattern payoff; inevitable in hindsight from early ritual seed.</comment>
