<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in her refusal of hibernation, embodied via sensors translating awe and new white emotion; fossil palm-press moment reveals character under pressure without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: emotion density builds from amber/gold to full white CR closure; "let the unknown speak through her instruments, through her body" delivers legible conceptual cost of solitary endurance as voice for the unmapped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (salt/iron air, knee-deep geothermal water) constrains progress and charges final image; cave as nervous system mirrors her mapping, with fossil shelf guiding pivotal touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catalogue unmapped via emotions) tightens via fossil-induced white that narrows to deeper chamber; agency in recalibrating and floating forecloses safe return, but cost felt more conceptually than viscerally on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of caves remembering emerges organically from emotion maps and fossil; final white chamber offers resonant CR repricing her purpose without moralizing, reweighting hibernation refusal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (mystical cartography, emotion-as-color); rhythmic control heightens immersion in "pale, shimmering white that floated off the projected map like smoke."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels without loops or artifacts; purposeful lyric metaphors cohere in peak white-mapping beat, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-heat-mapping post-hibernation caves and transitional fossil transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in "factually mystical" maps feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
