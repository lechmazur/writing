<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction—trembling hands amid "shoulders back, chin high"—earns final commitment; flaws like doubt complicate without hedging. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, scaling to closure renunciation of fiery tactics for resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stalled rebellion to resonant hum, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("the hum carried her breath out... like a promise"). Orientation anchors early; cost legible in final exhale after eleven-month lull.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Repair bay's "ribcage" and stone pillars constrain barefoot choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (cold soles to subsonic hum) mirrors POV priorities. Micro-setting (jammed roof revealing sky) evolves with daylight's margin, pressuring resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite lull) tightens texturally via hum's deepening and glyph pulse, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in endured stillness over violence. Minor abstractness in "patterns the stars repeated" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resonance-from-stasis emerges organically via particulars (Argument stars, hum); final image reconfigures "lull as breath before next word" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from stillness-not-surrender question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with stargazer perceptual signature (stars "close enough to whisper"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "thunderous serenity" paradox. Diction reflects embodied mind under emerging resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/image (e.g., "hum... lived more in bone than air"); no loops, varied rhythm supports textural build to closure. Figurative control elevates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ancient glyphs in sci-fi spaceport transform rebellion trope via barefoot resonance; "Argument" stars and opera glasses yield inevitable, risk-taking lyric closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
