<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the vault scene as trembling hands and internal debate force the micro-choice to photograph rather than destroy; final transmission earned by prior causality with personal risk cost. Interiority concrete and embodied, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density tightens from letter discovery to elevator surprise narrowing options, culminating in Charged Poise closure via transmission with felt societal/personal cost legible in final "ice shifting" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cryogenic vault and snow constrain choices (clumsy gloves, delicate handling) and charge final image (snow settling mirroring silent shift); sensory hierarchy (cold air taste, hum) reflects archivist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release truths?) signaled early, tightens via elevator reversal forcing blink-decision; agency in hiding/photographing/sending forecloses compliance path with legible risk cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-breaking truths emerges organically from letter's intimacy vs. suppression, answered non-literally in final soundless crack reweighting compliance myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (silence, cold focus); rhythmic control heightens pressure, brief dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, diction biased to archivist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "gram of data that could detonate a nation"); varied rhythm propels to closure without overwriting, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen archives/dormant nets transforms dystopian trope via intimate scandal; risk in quiet provocation inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
