<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in love for heartbreaking work; contradictory impulses peak when she almost sweeps seeds away but chooses to test one, earning the final reconfiguration with embodied gasp and laughter. Blind spots in entropy vs. deliberate vanishings drive genuine struggle. Final endurance of ongoing work shows earned stasis with felt cost of incompleteness resolved into migration insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from missing paths to seed revelation, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where memories migrate rather than vanish, with cost legible in "before the last of the foam dissolved" urgency and tern's departure scattering more. Orientation anchors instantly in geode cave. Single scene tightens meaningfully via bird's seeds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geode's prismatic waves and crater glass constrain choices (seed held to light reveals fragment) and charge final image of light casting emotional notation across surfaces. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's priorities: foam transliteration amid iridescent gloom. Lived-in choreography: workbench, shelves, fissure track cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (missing paths) signaled early tightens via seeds' arrival, narrowing options from conjecture to urgent transliteration with time cost before fading. Agency in testing seeds forecloses entropy hypothesis, reweighting under accumulative lens. Felt price in race against dissolution charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scattering memory emerges organically from foam gaps to seed vectors, resonant in final image of complete stories amid ongoing migration without tidy moral. Particulars like grief-love linkage avoid platitudes; tern's unintended planting reweights premise with conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: Maren's bias toward emotional notation filters light, foam, seeds idiomatically. Rhythmic modulation peaks in "Maren laughed, and the sound bounced cheerfully through the gloom." Lyrical diction purposeful, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines like "grief compressed into salt, laughter crystallized in bubbles" advance world/character without loops. Varied rhythm propels from conjecture to revelation; no scaffolds, clean syntax under pressure. Final image recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory migration via bird seeds transforms folklore tropes into geode-bound logic; tern's passage as unintentional planter risks bold conceptual pivot that heightens stakes inevitably. No derivatives; irreplaceable world feels lived.</comment>
