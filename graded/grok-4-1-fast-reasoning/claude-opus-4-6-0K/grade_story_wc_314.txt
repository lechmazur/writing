<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—precise logical flame fails, sentimental memory via starlings enables intuitive drop—with final harmonization earned by prior tension and embodied tears as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern (flame-memory-crystal) builds to CR closure in apple bite and orchard hum, cost legible in "tears arrive before understanding did" and notebook renunciation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard and waterfall constrain choice (trees shudder at light, apple falls) and charge final image; alchemist-filtered sensory hierarchy (colors defying pigments, air of green stone) integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition) signaled early, deepens via agency-driven shift from controlled flame to intuitive drop under accumulative lens, cost unmistakable in emotional tears and foreclosed logic path charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sentiment as catalyst emerges organically from particulars (mother's hands to starlings to apple); final image non-literally answers via "wonder distilled," reweighting logic/intuition braid without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (alchemical defiance of colors/pigments); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to charged compression at crystal drop, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "both vanished, replaced by a light"); minor figurative density in opening colors pays off accumulatively without muddle or loops in peak drop beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical Great Work via bird patterns and dew threshold transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in apple's "mother's kitchen" taste.</comment>
