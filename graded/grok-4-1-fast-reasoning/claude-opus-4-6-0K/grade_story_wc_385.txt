<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Richly perceptive trait shown concretely in cataloguing echoes and residue-sensing; final purpose earned via layered listening but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of voice layers tightening to CR closure; cost legible in "reed-blown melancholy" and lifelong corridor commitment as Maren rises and walks deeper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine corridors and starlight column constrain path choices and charge revelation as she sinks to knees; bare feet ground tactile progression, mirroring internal deepening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover echoing tightens via grandmother's voice into web, forcing purpose crystallization; agency in singing/following yields felt cost of endless duty in final hum alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of voices exceeding moments emerges via web particulars, answered non-literally by her shell-singing layering voice into stone; reweights premise with connective duty cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in subtleties like "grief bent the air" biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from exploratory to resonant in "canyon trembled with recognition."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory images without loops; figurative layering like "river that had forgotten how to flow" coherent and purposeful, varying rhythm to closure cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-memory web from accumulated singers transforms echo trope; bold accumulative risk in voice-density closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes via perceptual commitment.</comment>
