<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to illuminate assumptions roots every micro-choice, from stripping the room to layering loops, culminating in earned exorcism; Maren as secondary pressure via her doubled voice forces his escalation. Internal consistency shines in his "strange vocation," but lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as loops density-build to entity recoil and Maren's single-voiced scream (DC/RR with conceptual cost in unraveled assumptions); orientation anchors in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor's geometry constrains entity movement, forcing Elias's loop tactic and charging climax glow/pulse of grey circle; sensory hierarchy (muffled tear, anti-shadow) reflects priestly bias and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise via assumption-unraveling before completion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through provoked response ("She invited me") to scream/closure with felt cost in Maren's weeping; agency in pedal presses narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unchosen assumptions as possession-doors emerges organically from looped questions to final "scattered threads," offering resonant CR repricing surrender-as-peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in recursive phrasing mirroring loops; dialogue subtextual ("Did she?") advances pressure; rhythmic modulation peaks in climax silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via layered loops without redundancy; vivid, coherent metaphors ("fabric tearing underwater," "anti-shadow") enhance without muddling; zero artifacts, read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully to silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop-pedal philosophy-exorcism in dimensional anchor transforms possession trope via "unraveled stillness"; risk in abstract-concept grounding feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
