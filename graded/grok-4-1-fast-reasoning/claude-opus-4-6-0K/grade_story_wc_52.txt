<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses embodied in handling the wood blank versus fear of admitting Teodor "finished"; final carving choice earned through layered lessons with visible cost of letting go. Micro-choices like thumb-pressing pencil marks reveal values hierarchy. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via kettle stages paralleling "here and gone," culminating in Charged Poise RR/CR as she carves ("pressed the blade into the ash"), reconfiguring grief with undeniable emotional cost of release. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph. Persistent wood constraint shapes every beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skylight rain beads/rivers and ash blank constrain choices (lap light, thumb pressure) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (visual rust-hued, tactile grain) reflects widow's priorities. Tactile navigation (cross loft to kettle) coherent. Environment mirrors internal without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process grief via lessons) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through three lessons narrowing to carve-not-preserve agency; cost legible in "admitting he was finished" felt in wood-handling hesitation. Final act forecloses preservation path. No abstract stakes; all viscerally on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of using loss emerges organically from particulars (wood fossil, contain lesson, hand carving); final image non-literally answers "preserve perfectly?" via open-palmed hand holding nothing/anything. Complexity lingers in ambiguity of ongoing "harvesting." No moralizing; resonance from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (refracting droplets as "tiny lens," "crystallized time") biases via widow's craft lens; rhythmic modulation breathes with reflection to action. Stable close-3rd; purposeful compression taught early pays in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "contain... give it a shape it can live inside" advances theme/prose/closure); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors coherent (fossil/season, border crossings). Propulsion peaks cleanly at "pressed the blade."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion-tamer lessons ("timing," "contain") transform grief into carving hand-not-lion, risking quiet lyric closure that heightens stakes via irreplaceable wood motif. No template tropes; widow's perspective memorable/idiosyncratic. Bold non-obvious angle on widowhood.</comment>
