<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via notebook of displacements and embodied noticing (e.g., trellis rotation); motivation to understand alive houses drives surrender at door with earned cost of personal commitment; contradictory impulses subtle in protesting vs. surrendering to house's logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build to CR closure when hand feels inhale after shard return, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of persistent devotion; orientation anchored in para 1; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (amber hum, cool glass hush) filters through Maren's bias, constraining porch action; cherry blossoms in railing charge final image, mirroring internal realization without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand alive houses) signaled early, deepens texturally via displaced signs to hush-thickened realization; agency in returning shard narrows options, foreclosing detachment with felt cost of ongoing prayer; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sanctification via repetition emerges organically from particulars (doorknob, shoe, shard as stolen hymns); final hand-on-door reconfigures premise non-literally, resonant with counter-reading of love's persistence; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing migrations, daydreaming hour); rhythmic prose modulates to hush's texture under realization pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short hush sentences propel peak); metaphors coherent and purposeful (hush as textured glass), propelling to radiant silence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alive houses collecting prayers via displacements transforms haunted-house trope; risk in conceptual CR (loved, not haunted) inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
