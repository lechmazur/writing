<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sable's resourcefulness and patience drive micro-choices like gap-researching over brute search; Maren's grief reveals embodied emotion at discovery. Internal understanding shifts credibly without epiphany dumps. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak negotiation moment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via diary cross-referencing to negotiation to discovery; CR closure in "tuning the world... to what had been playing all along" reweights premise with conceptual cost of ignored wisdom. Orientation anchored early in Thornspire's description; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thornspire's granite corridors and altitude-native flowers constrain search tactics; final "humming faintly... melody she could almost hear" charges closure image. Sensory details (old paper/rain smell, acoustic fossils) filter through Sable's linguistic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Unlearned Lessons) signaled early, tightens via gap-convergence and Silence negotiation forcing trade-off (hours-long breath). Agency in speaking pre-writing language; cost felt in relenting and Maren's grief-simple realization. No agency-driven 9+ escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of refused wisdom emerges via petal-sentences and shifting-text books, answered non-literally in symphony metaphor recharging prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "simple the lessons were"; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (languages as acoustic fossils, shadows of references); dialogue subtextual ("Will they listen? ... music will be playing"). Rhythmic control modulates from patient to charged closure; elision of floors taught via gaps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gaps converged on Floor 7,744"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("negative shape, like a missing tooth") in research beat risks overwrite but fits accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel, linguistic mountain, chlorophyll cipher transforms tropes; diary-as-map/wards and "unheard symphony" CR feels inevitable from particulars. Bold premise commitment heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
