<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with sharpened senses from poverty driving micro-choices like uncorking bottles; contradictory impulses in accidental generosity yield earned realization. Final palms-on-sand moment reveals hierarchy of values with destitution's cost. Backstory anchors tilt present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bug pulses to full sync with volcano/celestials, landing CR closure in "transformation is not a moment but a texture" with legible cost of returned knowledge through skin. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity. Single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Black sand glows in sympathy with bugs, constraining release and charging final image; sensory hierarchy (sulfur/salt, tectonic hum) reflects Maren's sharpened perception. Evolving details (ash plume as phosphorescent snow) mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of transformation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bug sync/orbit to realization; agency in sequential uncorking forecloses ignorance with destitution's felt authority as cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of accidental weaving emerges organically from bug release and sand-glow image reweighting prior prophecies; resonant non-literal answer in "rough, luminous, endlessly reworkable" avoids moralizing. Complexity in poverty's authority lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (texture/grain metaphors) biases noticing toward molecular change; rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical hush. Stable close-third POV with clean psychic distance; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bugs' "cold fire painting Maren's gaunt face"); rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative layering taught early pays off in closure image. Propulsion accelerates to vibrant hush without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philanthropy, bugs, prophecies into textural CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame inevitable via "orchestrated coincidences." Bold celestial/volcano sync transforms tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
