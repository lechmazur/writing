<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in self-forgiveness ("narrower door") act simultaneously with embodied grief (pin as "bruise"), earning the final insertion as renunciation of hiding; flaws as caretaker complicate acceptance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure: pin slid into hair reconfigures grief cycle with legible cost in "willingness to remain rooted"; orientation anchored early in grotto climb, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vines as micro-setting constrain realization ("held inside themselves every summer"), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (cool stone, cloud gaps) mirrors internal hush through tactile POV filter without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment vs. exhaustion) deepens accumulatively via hairpin reflection, forcing endurance choice with cost in "cutting back"; agency in micro-turns (tracing ridges to insertion) narrows options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cycle of rebirth emerges organically from particulars (hairpin ridges, dormant vines), reweighting forgiveness without statement; final descent image offers resonant non-literal answer to thematic question of grief's hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (thumbnail on ridges, air "tasted of stone") biases toward tactile embodiment; rhythmic modulation heightens hush without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "clouds shifted like slow water" integrates sense/action); varied syntax propels from reflection to propulsion, flawless read-aloud rhythm untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom pilgrimage and vineyard dormancy transforms grief trope; climbing frame risks bold lyric structure, heightening stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
