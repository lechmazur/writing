<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's tinkerer motivation compels higher-stakes persistence, embodied in grease-blackened fingers and cracked voice; micro-choices like cradling the tendril reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: internal conflict leans toward steady resolve over simultaneous contradictions in pivotal singing beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from solo reconstruction to communal seventh hymn; on-page RR closure in vine uncurling with felt three-year cost. Orientation anchored early in arbor dawn; one tightening via villager gathering suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor's tendrils constrain first/last actions, charging final image; sensory dew drops and honeyed light mirror internal states through Maren's biased fixer lens. Micro-setting (tendril in palm) evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arbor restoration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to communal song narrowing solo-risk options; agency in progressive hymns forces trade-off of isolation for collective pressure. Cost legible in neighbors' worry and voice strain, charging vine response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-repair emerges organically via tinkering metaphor, reweighted in final "remedy... with the same care"; resonant non-literal answer in arbor's tender reach avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fixer idiom ("gear that skips," "talk a seized clock back"); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to charged hush without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates to climax; metaphors cohere (honey sieve, green reaching) without muddle in peak hymn beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkering-folklore restores tropes via specific songs/vine; risk in whimsical repair of sacred feels inevitable in hindsight without late rules.</comment>
