<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's backstory of near-death anchors her observant gift as both curse and compulsion, driving micro-choices like pausing at the mainspring and climbing for the box; final release mirrors her own "pressure held too long" with embodied ease in her chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust observation accumulates to light dying → ghost pressure → ceiling discovery → release click; charged poise closure lands with legible cost in eased chest pressure and promised action on letters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust strata and fluorescent drone as micro-settings constrain choices (thin dust spots observation, counter for climbing); recurring mainspring charges final lighter pocket image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of professional duty deepens texturally via ghost pressure tightening observation to engagement; agency in tile push forecloses hidden stasis with felt chest cost, though escalation subtle rather than sharply narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Burden-as-air theme emerges organically from dust/mainpring cracks/letters, reweighted in final "mostly air, mostly time" image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to hidden pressures via release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dust as sediment, ghosts as pressure) biases noticing; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under ghost stress, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (mainspring tension) without overwriting peaks; varied rhythm propels from drone silence to sun simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech's ghost-sight via pressure/dust in circus decay transforms tropes; mainspring as cracked endurance feels inevitable, risking lyric observation payoff.</comment>
