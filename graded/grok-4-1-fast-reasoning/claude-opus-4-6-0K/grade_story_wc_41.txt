<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's precognitive forgetfulness embodied in chalk ritual compels endurance against loss, with contradictory impulses (vision then erasure) peaking in Threnody step-in; final palm-press reveals hierarchy of values with shortening chalk cost. Flaw drives inevitable chalk-reliance compounding isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers from driftwood to vision to hum-realization; CR closure in "He listened. He forgot. He listened again" reconfigures echo-clinging with undeniable conceptual cost of endless cycle, chalk-nub image legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog and pipes constrain (markers needed, hum viscerally felt in sternum) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (hush presses eardrums, ice sings) mirrors POV's echo-obsession, selective via urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture echoes/sound vs. forgetting) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via girl-vision tightening to hum-repricing; endurance agency forecloses retention path, chalk-shortening cost felt charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clinging-to-echoes theme emerges from particulars (sculptures as ship-remains, chalk archive), final pipes-palm resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise: memory sediments into loss without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tidal perceptual signature ("mind were a tide"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short final sentences, diction biased to echoes (fog-ocean, hum-cells).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (fog "swallowed sound the way old videotapes... swallow time" does triple atmospheric/motivational/textural work); varied rhythm propels to charged closure image unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Junkyard prophet's forgetful visions transform precog trope into echo-archive; risk of lyric stasis pays off in hum-realization, fresh synthesis inevitable from garden particulars.</comment>
