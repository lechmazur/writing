<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (harden vs. forgive) act in scene through embodied anger/grief processing; final reconstruction earned by causal shedding of self-blame, with cost in foreclosed certainties. Interiority concrete via scarred hands and falcon scar; no unearned epiphanies. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("fragile convictions") embodied enough not to touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection density builds to Charged Poise closure in notebook-writing beat, reconfiguring stance with felt cost of shed assumptions. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (workshop, mist, Sable). No causality breaks; cost legible in "layer by layer, she shed what was false."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty workshop/stars constrain reflection (mist thickens mirroring process, jars supply chameleon cue); recurring tail tip charges final shelf-set image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pigment shimmer under lamplight). No white-room; spatial coherence via workbench/rafters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild convictions) signaled early via trembling hands/letter; accumulative deepening via neither harden-nor-forgive realization narrows to shedding, with agency in emotion-processing micro-choices. Cost unmistakable in foreclosed paths ("pretense that she could continue exactly as before"). One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (shedding for durable conviction) emerges organically from chameleon image shift (tail sacrifice → imperfect regrowth → Sable's report); final image offers non-literal answer reweighting betrayal without moralizing. Subtext in mist/stars mirroring fragile presence. No tidy binaries or statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (biological remnants as transformation cues); rhythmic control heightens stillness ("mist breathed through the workshop"). Elevated diction voice-motivated (lyric workshop voice); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "She picked up the smallest jar... a sacrifice of self" advances character/atmosphere/theme). Varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion; figurative layer purposeful without muddle in peak shedding beat. Zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chameleon tail transforms betrayal trope into shedding/regrowth arc, risking lyric reflection over plot action. Bold voice commits to shimmering stillness without retreat; no template echoes. Transformation test passes via workshop/biology grounding.</comment>
