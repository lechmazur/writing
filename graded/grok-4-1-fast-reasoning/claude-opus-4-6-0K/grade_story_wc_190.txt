<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's motivation to catalyze comfort through silence is embodied in concrete micro-choices like humming and slowing the gondola, earning the passengers' subtle transformations without epiphanies. Interiority feels particular via noise parsing and vial monitoring. Final endurance of return crossing shows hierarchy of values with cost in solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of noise, light, and vial fog builds to resonant reconfiguration when vial clears amid violet light curtain. Orientation anchored early in terrace and role. Closure Charged Poise in "silence finally teaching her," reweighting passage with felt emotional cost on return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prism light and cables constrain choices (slow to match drift) and charge final hush image. Sensory hierarchy via Sable's noise focus narrows perception purposefully. No white-room; spatial coherence in gondola transit through refracted haze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (turbulent vial/passengers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via humming pulsing light, narrowing to cleared vial. Agency in fluid adjustments forecloses discord with emotional cost legible in passengers' shifts and Sable's solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transit as transformation emerges via vial, light, silence without statement; final image of "hand offered in the dark" reconfigures premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars like dendrites dissolving, inviting ambiguity on silence's agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "parsing the ambient hum" biased to Sable's frequencies. Rhythm modulates with intensity; purposeful compression in transit pays off at violet glow. No head-hopping despite passengers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density: lines like "cables threaded... silver nerves" advance atmosphere and voice without loops. Metaphors coherent (whistle "blade through silk"), rhythm varies read-aloud. Zero artifacts; propulsion peaks in violet curtain beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional storm glass and prism transit transforms silence trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via vial's dendrites. Inevitable hindsight in return hush recharging opening echo pause.</comment>
