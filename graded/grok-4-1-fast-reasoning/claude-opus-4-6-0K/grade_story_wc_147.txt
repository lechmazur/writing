<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the knife-reaching moment versus borrowed calm from priestesses, earning the final renunciation of force with embodied cost in panic overridden. Interiority particular via voice's "lilted upward... invitation." Flawless single-POV execution under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush and time builds to Charged Poise closure in final ascent image, where vial's tremor reconfigures ephemeral stake with silence's conceptual cost. Orientation instant; one tightening via unsnarling suffices. Cost legible in "risking... death" vs. patience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Temple constrains pivotal unsnarling (tangle, depth force stillness); bioluminescent glyphs and "coral crusted... candles" charge hush motif into final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows crisis to rebreather hiss and console ticks. Micro-setting vial/body evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vial for voice amid air clock) tightens accumulatively at unsnarling, where overriding instinct forecloses cut-cable path with death-risk trade-off. Agency in "easing... outermost loop"; cost alters tactics visibly. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral theme emerges organically via priestesses' paradox, vial's laugh-to-tremor shift reweighting prior loss without statement. Final "silence... honest reply" answers invitation non-literally, charging sun's indifference. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close-third POV stable, perceptual signature in "gathered hush... held its breath." Rhythm modulates panic (short console checks) to poise. Diction purposeful ("spectral blue," "lonesome splendor"); no head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; density peaks in unsnarling ("outermost loop... next") with propulsion via varied syntax. Figuratives integrated ("cable... nightmarish snarl") without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with time pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-perfume vial in drowned temple transforms artifact-trope via ephemeral cult logic. Risk in quiet poise ending heightens thematic stakes. Irreplaceable hush-vial-sun arc feels inevitable.</comment>
