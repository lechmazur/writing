<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in sensory memories like scallion oil and mulberry tree; micro-choices in writing fortunes reveal values with exhaustion as cost. Contradictory impulses harmonize toward earned realization without tidy rationality. Final endurance of homesickness forecloses return, scaled perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map to rapid fortunes to CR closure in final fortune/image of stranger's cookie. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards, single scene fits defaults. Cost legible in "slow tide of exhaustion" before dawn reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and frozen lake's mirrored horizon constrain reflection and charge final dawn image, mirroring internal infinity. Sensory details selective (pearlescent spiral, gold on ice) filter through POV homesickness. Spatial choreography coherent in glass spire desk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping homesickness signaled early; Accumulative escalation via writing rush and realization tightens to Charged Poise. Agency in pen choices forecloses literal return with felt exhaustion cost. Minor abstractness in "symphonies" but legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent harmonies emerges from shell, lake, fortunes without statement; final image reweights mapping as conduction with stranger's inexplicable taste. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. No moralizing, ambiguity in "unheard and whole."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (logarithmic shell as music) modulates rhythmically; POV stable, no elision issues. Compression taught early pays off in dawn hush. Syntax reflects porous mind under liminal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm sings aloud; no loops, purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle. "Silence inside was so complete it almost sang" propels closure image. Minor figurative density in reflections but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing as symphonic mapping transforms homesickness trope; nautilus-logarithm angle non-obvious. Risky lyric hush heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight from shell to cookie.</comment>
