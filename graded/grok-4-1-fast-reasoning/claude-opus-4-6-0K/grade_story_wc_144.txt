<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's heartfelt intuition shines in tactile calibration ("vibrations through her fingertips"), balancing competence with blindness's struggle; micro-choices like jeweler's pick reveal values hierarchy. Maren applies timed pressure without dominating. Final endurance of ongoing repairs earns closure with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via repair beats to Charged Poise closure: drone's "seamless" hum and figure eight reconfigure stakes, cost felt in time pressure ("horn sounded") and her adaptive limits. Anchors clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fountain mist constrains calibration ("tilted it slowly, letting its sensors drink") and charges final image ("mist closed behind her"). Sensory bias (sounds, vibrations) filters through Elara's tactility; depot evolves with ship's horn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drone pre-voyage) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via servo adjustment and fountain test narrowing options. Agency in her method; cost visible in clanking chain as she succeeds. Subtle escalation fits lens but lacks sharp micro-turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intuitive mending emerges via particulars: drone mirrors Elara's sight loss, final image ("every departure begins with something mended") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of perpetual breakage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in embodied senses ("hum was seamless"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("How do you know it's right?"). Rhythm modulates calmly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels (e.g., short hum sentences build to flight); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (mist "patient and luminous"). Propulsion peaks at "precise figure eight."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan calibrates light-drone via mist vibrations transforms disability trope organically. Risk in non-visual repair heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from opening fountain cue.</comment>
