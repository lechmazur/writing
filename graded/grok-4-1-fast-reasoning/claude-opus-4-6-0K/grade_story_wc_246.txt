<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Confidently uncertain trait acts as contradictory impulse throughout, embodied in "sure of the mechanism, unsure of the cost"; final endurance of restrained authorship earned by prior error corrections with fading pen as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from signal errors to pen discovery to final Charged Poise; closure lands on-page in "pressed the nib to the page" with legible conceptual cost of impending final edit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Locus as gravitational anomaly constrains all signal work and pen use; recurring pen charges final image, with "spacetime pooled like water in a cupped palm" mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of responsible history-editing tightens accumulatively via deepening from error fixes to "strange comfort"; pen's lightening provides felt cost charging closure without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of threshing meaning emerges organically from signal edits and contingency; final image reweights authorship premise non-literally as "sure that the signal meant something. Unsure what it would mean once she was done."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in signal metaphors like "electromagnetic whispers" and "harmonic ghosts"; rhythmic control heightens reflective pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "pooling silence of bent time"; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, though minor "unbend" repetition purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of anomaly-distorted signals and contingency-pen transforms time-edit trope; risk of subtle sci-fi logic pays off in inevitable-feeling closure without gimmickry.</comment>
