<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of enthusiasm and stellar doubt act simultaneously in the humming beat, earning the final song; "stellar doubt gnawed at her" embodies internal conflict with micro-choice to persist, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static density increases to resonant tone; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via song triggering cosmic response with legible cost in doubt's confrontation; coins melting into stars reconfigures premise on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber walls and coin cloth constrain actions (ear pressed to wall, sliding coins); final glow and melted coins charge closure image, with sensory vibrations mirroring internal tuning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of alignment tightens via faster bursts and vibrating coins under accumulative lens; agency in pitch adjustment forecloses doubt path with felt emotional cost crystallized at song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonant purpose emerges implicitly from reordered prophecy and matching hum; final image of melted stars offers non-literal answer reweighting contraction as listening without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vibration-feelings and coin-pattern bias; rhythmic modulation heightens during hum-to-song escalation without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (backwards sentences, frequency wavelength) taught early; minor density overload in opening cosmic setup slightly dulls propulsion before humming beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy and coin-stars synthesis transforms cosmic contraction trope into resonant listening premise; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
