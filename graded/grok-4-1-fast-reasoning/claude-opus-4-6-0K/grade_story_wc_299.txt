<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied details like pressing the cloth's weave against his thumb, revealing contradictory impulses of certainty dissolving; final realization earned through prior micro-choices in appraisal ritual. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("confidently uncertain") borders therapy-speak but ties to pivotal Harrisburg failure without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from cloth analysis to tin box discovery, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing ("it was never the sound... the thread in the weave") with felt cost of "loss stacked like geological strata"; orientation anchored by ~50 words in trailer/quarry setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry's "echo valley" and trailer heater ticking constrain isolation-driven reflection, charging final image of walls as "cupped hands"; cloth as micro-setting mirrors internal state through tactile handling, selective sensory bias (silence vs. past vibrations) purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose post-loss signaled early, tightens via tin box deepening knowledge under accumulative lens; agency in wrestling lid and aligning cloth/photo forecloses doubt-path with legible emotional cost in uninsulated realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of uncelebrated purpose emerges organically from cloth/photo bridge, final image ("silence would know what it was holding") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing; no thematic echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (audio-honed details like "frequencies that bypassed thought"); brief Rita dialogue natural, goal-driven (drops box), voice rhythmic under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (short punchy realizations amid longer reflections); no loops or artifacts dull closure—"He placed the scrap back... began writing"—rhythm breathes with scene, minor metaphor density purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie past/quarry present via Saranac cloth linking expo failure to pavilion photo; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically, no derivative hedging.</comment>
