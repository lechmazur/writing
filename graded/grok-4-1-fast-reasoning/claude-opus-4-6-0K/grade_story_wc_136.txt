<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong character-specific interiority and motivation rooted in devotion to mapping; micro-choices like marking the chart reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses evident in trembling hands against steady hand; final endurance to complete map before reading earns closure with cost. Minor reflective backstory anchors well without flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-building discoveries (cracks, punch, door) converging on CR closure: map completion and mother's letter reconfigure premise with personal cost legible in "She picked up the envelope." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (fog diffusing stars, phosphorescent moss) filter through mapper's bias, constraining choices via arrow-cracks and keyhole. Setting charges final image: archive mirrors internal mapping devotion. Micro-setting (punch, paper slip) indispensable to entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel map to archive) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepenings narrowing options (lock opens, door yields); agency in daring insertions forecloses retreat. Cost felt in transition to personal truth ("her mother's"); one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of devotion transcending evidence emerges organically from particulars (maps as key, archive of silences); final image—wet ink shining, midnight strike, reading—resonates as non-literal answer reweighting obsession's price without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (geographic intention in cracks); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive poise to charged intensity. Perceptual bias (analyzing fractures) character-specific; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; varied rhythm propels (short sentences in descent). Minor overwriting in opening descriptors ("analytically artistic") but purposeful and non-closing; no loops, artifacts, or muddle in peak (door/entry).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping as literal key to truths' archive; phantom punch transforms trope ingeniously. Risky conceptual pivot (cracks/arrows) feels inevitable; bold, non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
