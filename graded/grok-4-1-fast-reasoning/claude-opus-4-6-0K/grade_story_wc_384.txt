<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via thorn pain and brush strokes; contradictory endurance vs. release impulses act in the key's realization beat, earning the final renunciation with felt cost in lingering shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of forgeries, names, and objects building to CR closure; "unlink" reconfigures self-imposed chain with legible cost in "taut wire... loosen—not snap," no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora light reveals key engraving and paints final shadow, charging closure image; stalactites' drip as metronome constrains temporal pressure, sensory hierarchy fits calligrapher's precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unfinished pardons tightens via key's arrival and realization, forcing renunciation with on-page cost in settling names as "memories, no longer debts"; single deepening under textural lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-pardon emerges organically from forgeries, thorn, and key without statement; final image of empty hands and stretching shadow reweights "wisely enduring" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light ("pearl twilight") and precision diction; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in exit beat, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels to closure, figurative coherence ("ribs of some delicate beast," "architecture of what she owed") enhances without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Calligraphy forger's "calibrated treason" premise ingeniously synthesizes bureaucracy exploit and self-unlink metaphor; key's engraving as maternal permission transforms trope of unfinished duty into fresh CR.</comment>
