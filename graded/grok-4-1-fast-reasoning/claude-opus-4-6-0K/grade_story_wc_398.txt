<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion (knot undone in chest) and contradictory impulses (grief vs. meaning) acting in scene; final micro-choices (folding letter, harvesting) earned by causal buildup of parallels. Voice coherent and specific to Maren's vineyard-rooted worldview. Flawless single-POV execution with no therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bus departure to letter handling to decision, with Charged Poise closure in final harvesting action; cost legible in "not all thirty acres -- that was impossible alone." Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (wind scattering papers, ripe fruit scent), filtered through Maren's priorities; pavilion and vines constrain choice (harvest now, alone) and charge final image of pulling cluster. Atmosphere mirrors internal shift from dusk dissolution to planted resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (embrace mismatch vs. bitterness) signaled early, tightens via letter-cued parallels that force stance crystallization; agency in renunciation (hate Luca unnecessary) with felt cost (solitude, partial harvest). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches as teachers emerges organically from letter, Elise/Luca parallels, and vines; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (harvesting as monument) reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity embraced in holding dual truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (vineyard textures, light shifts); rhythmic prose modulates from wind-rustled reflection to subtle resolve, diction controlled and voice-motivated. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "She was not stranded. She was planted."); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (embers/fog) without muddle. Clean grammar, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard isolation and generational letter transforms breakup trope via "mismatches as architecture"; risk in lyric accumulative close heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early letter cue.</comment>
