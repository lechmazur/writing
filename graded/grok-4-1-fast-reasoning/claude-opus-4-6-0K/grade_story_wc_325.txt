<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobic contradiction embodied in "heart hammering" history and peaking at "lungs tightening, vision narrowing," compelling micro-choice to whisper names and endure for mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via discovery density to CR closure; tide constraint ("eighteen minutes") shapes tactics, paying off in "climbed toward daylight with the weight" cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment> Tidal "seeped through hairline fractures" and "groaned" constrain pace, mirroring internal state; gold flecks and codex charge final "golden flecks... against her spine" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of retrieval vs. phobia/tide deepens agency-driven at "worked faster" under clock; cost unmistakable in endured constriction foreclosing panic path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere" entries reweighted by carried codex into surfacing voices; final image answers unremembered attention without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in tidal/facility breath sync; rhythm compresses under stress to "Real people... erased," stable third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful figures like "altars to an abandoned faith" propel without muddle in peak discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cold War post as ocean-voice listener via slack tide/gold codex synthesizes fresh cosmic angle; risk of lyric CR heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
