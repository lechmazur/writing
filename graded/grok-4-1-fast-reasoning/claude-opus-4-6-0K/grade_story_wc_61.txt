<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied emotion (gear "bite softly into her skin") and contradictory impulses (tenderness vs. ache) compelling the final endurance; generational flaw complicates without hedging; micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in "She would seed it... petals spiraling... She let the petals fall," reweighting perfection's cost legibly on-page; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden and sonar-constrained body charge choices (altering transit to darkness) and final image; petals recur to mirror internal states through action; sensory hierarchy (listening over sight) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pure light curation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via unease to seeding decision narrowing options; agency in endurance forecloses fire-path with felt perpetual cost; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impossible purity emerges organically from gear-petals-fire particulars, resonant CR in final seeding reweights generational premise without moral; ambiguity lingers in "troubling serenity."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature (pings mapping change); rhythmic modulation builds texture; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pings advance nav, map change, echo lineage); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (petals as "gentle deaths"); propels to charged end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardening and recursive infinity transforms tropes via sonar-petals specificity; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in pocket-of-darkness turn; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
