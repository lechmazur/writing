<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction of swallowed silence vs calibration need drives micro-choices like studying smudge; descent decision earned with relational cost of imperfect love.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to oracle's thermal inversion curve as CR; cost of stagnant truth legible in "prevented everything around it from moving," charging descent resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Smudged gentian and corner oracle constrain perception, mirror internal sway; "copper light" and ozone integrate purposefully to charge final altitude image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Swallowed truth stake signaled early deepens via oracle curve narrowing to confrontation; agency in query and descent forecloses isolation with mechanism-of-love cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "clarity and cold are often the same thing" reweights precision vs fault-tolerance without moral; smudge reprise resonates imperfect restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Meteorological perceptual signature ("barometers know weather") biases noticing; rhythm tightens from hollowed body to humming copper under post-fever stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "weighed exactly as much as stagnant air"; varied rhythm propels to "stepped outside" without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle transforms inheritance lie into inversion calculus; margins synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric closure on corroded love.</comment>
