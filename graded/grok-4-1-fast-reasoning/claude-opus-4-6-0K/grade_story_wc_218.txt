<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices like copper wiring reveal character-particular resolve, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure as Conceptual Repricing in final paragraph ("She had not cured anything... worth whatever time remains") lands with felt cost of mortality reconfigured as integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Orchard pillars constrain choices (water channels, shade dictate wiring targets) and charge final image of "ancient, shared breath."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal secrets before death) tightens accumulatively through project stages; agency in remodeling forecloses isolation with cost of time legible in diary's final entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interdependence emerges organically via copper tracery and pillar shadows; final image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting death as "part of what they tend."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (botanical precision in "capillary channels," "cambium layer"); rhythmic control heightens calm under terminal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (wire "becoming part of the tree") without muddling peak closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bio-mineral engineering transformed via copper staining and death-acceptance risk; feels inevitable in "every caretaker eventually becomes part of what they tend."</comment>
