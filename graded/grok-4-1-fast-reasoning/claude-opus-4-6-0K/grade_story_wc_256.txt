<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with pulse in fingertips revealing character under pressure; realization of taxidermy vs. resonance shows contradictory impulses acting in the grid collapse reflection and vault descent. Final stance of sacred attention earned via lens discovery. No safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from habit-lamp to lens revelation to Vault Nineteen resonance. Closure as CR in final bell strike reweights preservation with conceptual cost of past work's emptiness. Orientation anchored early in lab post-stabilization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vault Nineteen wax cylinders constrain choice by enabling sympathetic resonance through lens; golden shadows as recurring micro-setting charge final image. Sensory hierarchy sound-biased via POV. No white-room; tactile lab evolution mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of true listening tightens texturally via lens harmonic surfacing and vault whispers; agency in questioning deepens to foreclose mechanical preservation path. Cost legible in woven voices texture, charging Charged Poise close. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-texture emerges from lens-folding overtones and cylinder whispers, not statement; final wave image non-literally answers loss via "nothing was lost." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound geometries and vibrations; rhythmic control modulates from habitual lamp to trembling air crescendo. Stable close third-person limited, no leakage. Prose texture reflects sound-preserver mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "golden shadows climbed the walls"; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (woven cloth threads), propel without overwriting in peak resonance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archive as resonance pilgrimage transforms preservation trope; lens as talisman-tool enables non-obvious harmonic revelation. Bold lyric risk in textural drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
