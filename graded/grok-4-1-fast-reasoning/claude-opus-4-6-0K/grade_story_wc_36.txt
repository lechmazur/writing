<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal shift from static keeper to active weaver earned via flute-playing climax with embodied fossil-pressed knowledge; contradictory preserve-vs-use impulses act in uncasing hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo-density layers to CR closure in "failure like a seed—cracked open"; driftwood markers motivate return ellipsis with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt canyon throat constrains flute resonance, enabling world-weave; "silence resettled around her, enormous, patient" with canyon breath charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of harvesting failure tightens via multiplying echoes forcing realization; agency in playing forecloses preservation path with seed-growth cost legible on descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood marker declaring "stopped keeping and started listening" resonates non-literally on preservation-vs-use theme; reweights relics via concrete flute visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geological perceptual signature in "loom made of geography" and "fossil into shale" biases noticing; rhythm swells with sound architecture then hushes coherently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "single tone became a chord became a architecture of sound" propels without loops; varied syntax matches hush-to-climax needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flute as world-loom in echo-geology transforms guardian trope organically; lyric ascent risks quiet CR that heightens stakes via irreplaceable resonance spot.</comment>
