<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—respecting Fen's silence versus breaking her rules—act simultaneously in reflections and culminate in the forging choice, earned by prior failures with embodied cost ("sharp pull" in chest).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: reflective density builds to cadence shift in coin's creation and hanging; closure as Charged Poise RR with legible cost ("luminous regret for the rest of her life").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Foundry's wet iron, furnace heat, and silver rain threads constrain forging and charge final image (coin spinning in rain/light outside door).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (call Fen home) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven forging that forecloses balanced path; felt cost unmistakable in "Something was taken."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of filled coin reweights blank-center question non-literally, emerging organically from kintsugi particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystical facts like "balance... factually mystical"); rhythmic control heightens introspective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, coherent metaphors (stars surrendering, metal sang); propulsion aligns with accumulative builds to "the metal sang" closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical kintsugi and zodiac blank reconfigures redemption trope; risk of imbalance break feels inevitable from established rules.</comment>
