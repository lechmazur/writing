<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization excels in particular interiority via embodied actions like tracing stone as equations; release of gauge as micro-choice reveals value hierarchy with cost. Minor slip: opener's "logical dreamer" edges into label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density tightening to Charged Poise closure at "pressed it into the wet stone and let go," legible cost in forfeiture of heirloom amid rising tide. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto and tide constrain choices (threaten erasure, force release) and charge final image; sensory details (light scattering on beads) POV-filtered via math/wave lens. Micro-setting via gauge/beads integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (modeling hope via patterns vs. tide) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as tide "crept across the grotto floor," narrowing to release agency with on-page cost. Escalation reweights via density to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hope-as-system theme emerges organically from bead timelines converging; final "small paper lantern... climbing past 3,200 feet" offers resonant non-literal repricing, reweighting grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in math-refracting prose (e.g., "mathematics of wave interference"); rhythmic control modulates serene intensity, stable close-third POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., bead colors map timelines in action); varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors taught early—no loops, minor figurative density in reflections doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math/grief/sea erodes tropes via bead timelines; risk-taking in abstract modeling pays at gauge-tide convergence, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
