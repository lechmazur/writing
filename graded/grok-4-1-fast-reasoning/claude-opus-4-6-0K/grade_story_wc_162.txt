<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via grain-tracing inheritance and log patterns; "featherly determined" embodies persistent micro-choices against rage, earning final realization with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as log entries densify to CAVOK CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph, closure reconfigures distance with legible cost in palm-press image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drifting terrace and prismatic light constrain perception, mirroring internal fracture; oak grain as micro-setting charges final intuition, POV-filtered through architect's lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of paternal distance tightens texturally via pattern-deepening, forcing renunciation of lost-child narrative; cost felt in "channels diverged" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thresholds as "distances compressed into a frame" emerges organically from maze/log/grain particulars; final "I was watching" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-reading (grain, weather codes); rhythmic control modulates hush to charged clarity, stable single-POV with no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "light broke and reformed" propels to closure without figurative muddle or overwriting in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather-log-as-maze for distant watching transforms estrangement trope; lyric accumulation risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via CAVOK payoff.</comment>
