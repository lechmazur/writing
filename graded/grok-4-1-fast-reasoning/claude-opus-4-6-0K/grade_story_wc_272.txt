<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (flee vs. embrace pressure via "what if she didn't flee?"), culminating in earned choice to layer fragments with visible cost to prior method; interiority concrete and particular (stomach turns at style match).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density from card discovery to painting crystallizes RR (Charged Poise) in "something crystallized"; cost legible in room's shrink/expansion and splintered truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library constrains choice (source of cards, pressure via walls pressing "by inches"); recurring crescent shape charges final vastness and mirrors internal fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (fractured art) deepens via agency (hold mismatched eyes, "let them" close); cost unmistakable in endured compression yielding shimmering portrait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (portrait to horizon as "splintered...true") resonantly reweights fragmentation from failure to inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (artistic: "jawline splitting into two competing angles") with rhythmic control; stable limited POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (multi-job lines like "luminous, aching with attention"); propulsion peaks in compression ("The room shrank to the size of the canvas").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of portraiture inheritance via face-fragment cards transforms failure into "tapestry of overlapping moments"; risk in abstract layering heightens closure.</comment>
