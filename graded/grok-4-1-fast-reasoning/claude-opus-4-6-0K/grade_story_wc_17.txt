<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal sitting with diaries embodies contradictory legacy pull versus isolation fear acting simultaneously; micro-choice to pack and proceed earns closure with felt cost of potential self-consumption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo taps layer to waveform proof, tightening via mother's diaries/negative; charged poise closure ("walked deeper... following the sound") reconfigures options with "trembling" wall as undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corridors/walls constrain via acoustic mapping ("tone spiraled... layered whispers"), charging final palm-press image where building's "faintly trembling" mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake deepens agency-driven from echo resonance to visual neural proof, narrowing to obsession trade-off; mother's disappearance and "frequency just below grief" make cost visceral on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Waveform "dendritic branching like thought" offers non-literal answer to walls-dreaming premise, reweighting legacy without moralizing; final echo-follow crystallizes conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acoustic perceptual signature ("echo told her things... vibrating at a frequency just below grief") biases noticing consistently under rising pressure, with rhythmic modulation intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in peak discoveries ("half-burned diaries... pages curled but still partially legible") propels without loops or artifacts; varied rhythm sustains closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Echo cartography's acoustics-as-neurons synthesis transforms haunted-building trope into inevitable legacy crucible, with bold "walls dream" premise risking and rewarding conceptual payoff.</comment>
