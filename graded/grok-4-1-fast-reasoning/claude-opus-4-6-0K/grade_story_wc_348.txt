<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via polymer lens on foam and chrysalis; motivation to atone intensifies through embodied grief release ("unlocked something in her chest"); earned change in resolve to credit Jonas first, with flaw of past numbness complicating without safety-hedging. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to CR closure ("She would write it with his name first") with felt emotional cost in grief motion; single scene oriented early (ravine, boots, atonement); no causality breaks, pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ravine/foam micro-setting constrains insight choice and charges final image ("The foam caught light"); sensory hierarchy via chemist's bias (geometry, structure); body/environment interplay embodied (crouched, wet stone, jacket pocket). Recurrent birch canopy and water voices evolve purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via rebonding) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through foam observation reversal that narrows to new-paper agency; cost legible in grief release and confrontation resolve; lacks overt trade-off in scene for 8.8+ entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of separation-as-information emerges organically from foam/polymer/chrysalis particulars, resonant CR in final ravine image reweights premise without moral; subtext in divergent paths enriches ambiguity; no thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with symphonic perceptual signature ("hearing the whole chord"); rhythmic modulation under insight ("pieces fell into place"); diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects chemist's precision; no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., foam observation multi-job: sensory/insight/theme); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful and coherent (braiding as language); read-aloud ear flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science/river foam/metamorphosis transforms grief trope; chrysalis insight turn inevitable from particulars; bold lyric risk in nature-observation epiphany heightens stakes organically.</comment>
