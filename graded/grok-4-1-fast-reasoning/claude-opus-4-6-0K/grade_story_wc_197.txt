<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's invisibility as deliberate choice roots motivation deeply, with endurance in solo broadcast earning her reappearance; interiority concrete via "every act of invisibility was a choice." Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers exceptionalism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from unraveling to puddle-guided discovery, landing CR closure in "The signal pulsed outward... The broadcast held" with felt cost of isolation and uncertain reception. One tightening via reflections suffices; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Puddles as micro-setting constrain navigation choice ("each reflection revealing what her forward-looking eyes had learned to ignore"), charging final auric lagoon image. Sensory selection (amber/violet dusk, golden luminescence) purposeful and POV-biased; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast truth vs. indifference) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via unraveling → resourceful solo path → charged poise at transmission with legible cost in solitude/risk. Protagonist agency in puddle method and key use drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured indifference as breakable emerges organically via Bureau softening and final "people paused. Some remembered," reweighting premise without statement. Lagoon image offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in reception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("looked at it sideways, in the mirror of water"); rhythmic modulation builds to lyric close. Voice texture purposeful in selective compression, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("She set the forms down, straightened her desk, and walked out as if leaving for lunch"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language (puddles/golden water) coherent and pattern-taught. Zero scaffold obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puddle reflections as map transforms dystopian rebel trope into fresh, sideways ingenuity, synthesizing with auric lagoon for inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
