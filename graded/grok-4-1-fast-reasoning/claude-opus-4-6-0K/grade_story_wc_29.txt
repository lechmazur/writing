<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete traits like ignoring subsonics and pinning charts everywhere compelling her interference; final hope earned via patient endurance against factions. Contradictory impulses (brilliance vs. unproven reputation) act in broadcast choice with visible isolation cost. No on-page relationships, but single-POV execution flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure in final paragraph reconfigures stakes via responses and "they were watching," with felt cost of isolation amid hope; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of signal realizations. Single scene anchored early (radio station, no sleep); one tightening broadcast suffices. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station micro-setting (burnt coffee, ozone, pinned charts) constrains broadcast and charges final study moment; sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's priorities (subsonics over standard). Body under stress (four days sleepless) narrows perception purposefully. Recurrent charts evolve from mapping to hope anchor.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit via unpredictability) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through probe logic to broadcast agency; responses force stance crystallization with faction pressure cost. One deepening (subsonic pattern) narrows options legibly. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, cost felt in risky 2 a.m. solo act.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of manipulative signals emerges organically via nested whispers and faction engineering, resonant in "third option" proposal without moralizing. Final "starlight filtered through smoke" reweights premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in patient outwitting amid blind spots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual signature (astronomical patterns as "voice whispering beneath a scream"); rhythmic control heightens under stress (short sentences in broadcast buildup). No dialogue on-page; voice distinct, modulating to raw steadiness. Elision minimal, all legible.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "recursive structure, a signal nested inside a signal"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (whisper/scream), no overwriting in peak broadcast. Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh SETI inversion—tricksters probing human blind spots via subsonics—transforms trope through Maren's randomization tactic; inevitable in hindsight from charts/signal mapping. Bold conceptual risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
