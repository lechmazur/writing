<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via music-specific metaphors reveals contradictory wistfulness and resolve; final endurance of playing on earned by prior strategic traits. Minor label-speak in "strategically creative" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: fingers not stopping as night arrives reconfigures time/stasis with clock's frozen cost legible on page. Backstory shards anchor to present piano/clock without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (salt/jasmine air, rising clouds) filters through pianist's priorities; arbor vines constrain piano/keys and charge final image, mirroring internal tidal pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surprise fate via music) signaled early, textural escalation via motif density forces endurance agency; cost unmistakable in defying clock/night with "fingers did not stop."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden passages emerges organically from film/clues/arbor; final image of persistent playing offers resonant non-literal answer to fate's finality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical syntax/rhythm distinctively embodies POV perception; prose modulates intensity toward closure without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "tide of silver") coherent under lyric mode without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film-reel map, floating arbor, clock-defying encore transforms loss tropes; risk in poetic conceit heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
