<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("shimmer eat another degree," cold as "second skeleton"); contradictory impulses act in volunteering despite tumor; final renunciation of clinic call earned by work's accumulation with visible cost in postponed certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via trawling days to pattern break ("woke up changed") and Charged Poise closure ("She would call... Or she would not," parasol shadows); cost legible in foreclosed immediacy and "shifted with it, loosely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choices (groaning piers, grapple drags) and charges final image (lace shadows on ice); sensory hierarchy (cold in lungs, wind sounds) POV-biased toward endings; micro-object (parasol tip) as setting evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (controlled ending vs. windborne living) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via worsening vision offset by parasol solace; agency in ignoring call forecloses path with on-page cost (uncertainty embraced); pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (endings' multisound nature) emerges from particulars (creak, drag, click); final parasol image reconfigures prior ice/work without moralizing; subtext in artifact's survival vs. clinic choice lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature (shimmer halo, wind hymns); diction/rhythm modulate with intensity (short work sentences, lyrical calm at end); purposeful compression in day elisions taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "busy hands... quiet even a mind convinced"); rhythm varies (long undulating to crisp finale); metaphors integrated (patience "fold," coral rebuild) without muddle in peak (waking changed).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism via Arctic trawling yields parasol epiphany; transforms tropes (death quest to work solace) organically; quiet Charged Poise risks bold stasis heightening stakes.</comment>
