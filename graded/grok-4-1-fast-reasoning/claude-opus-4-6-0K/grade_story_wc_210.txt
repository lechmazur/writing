<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—doubt from desertion versus resolve to rebuild—act in scene through rejection of offers and precise lantern work, earning the final endurance with isolation's cost. Interiority concrete via sensory memory (hands vibrate, nose recalls). No unearned epiphanies; realization anchors in accumulated practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory layers build to CR closure in "Cove... felt like a beginning," reweighting wishes with labor's conceptual cost legible in restored lanterns. Orientation anchored early (dock, Cove, post-wish). One tightening via memory-realization suffices; no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lanterns as micro-setting constrain choice (rebuilt for resonance) and charge final image ("humming faintly"). Sensory hierarchy alchemist-specific (vibration, copper smell). Details evolve causally from torn to restored, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival sans wishes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through memory-conception narrowing to resonance plan. Agency in micro-choices forecloses leaving with felt isolation cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise endimage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (labor over wishes) emerges organically from seed-Residuum image shifting to lanterns' hum, offering non-literal answer: "beginning that had rejected... wished for." Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature: alchemist biases (reactive vibrations, night-blooming sweetness). Rhythmic control modulates from reflective to propulsive in rebuild beat. No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (advance mood/character/action). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful ("throat that had forgotten song") without muddle. Propulsion aligns with accumulative rise to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Residuum-as-seed transforms wishing-well trope into resonance-labor revival, inevitable in lantern reprise. Bold quiet risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
