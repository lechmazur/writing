<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's curator trait and "listening heals" conviction compel contradictory impulses—pry vs. endure—acting in her daily arrivals and culminating in earned stasis by not opening the mailbox, with visible cost of sustained mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens gathers neighborhood fragments into density-tightening climax of woman's arrival; Charged Poise closure in locket display and final mailbox shift reconfigures options with conceptual cost of unopened release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard's "bruised orange light" and jasmine trellis constrain patient observation while charging final "amber stillness," mirroring internal suspension against construction roar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of validating listening via mystery deepens accumulatively through leads, narrowing to endurance choice; cost legible in forgone tools and sustained whisper, though agency leans passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of communal narrative healing emerges implicitly, answered non-literally by "unsent letter of forgiveness" window card that reweights mailbox burden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature—"jeweler gives to uncut stones"—modulates rhythmically with pressure, rendering woman's dialogue subtextual and natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops, though minor figurative density ("eye of a sandstorm") in opener risks slight overwrites; peak stillness contrast clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mystery trope transformed via passive "following" into healing stasis feels organic and risky, synthesizing mailbox/locket with neighborhood chorus inevitably.</comment>
