<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied tears and dream-revelation tying past lives to present whispers; contradictory gift/wound emotions act in weeping scenes. Final remembrance earned through bead's progression. Minor lack of simultaneous impulses caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cameo density tightening remembrance stake to RR closure; bead shattering and veil-to-gold shift deliver legible emotional cost of lifetimes' separation. Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemical fruits and moonlight channels constrain appearances and charge ripening at closure; sensory hierarchy (hum, scent) mirrors awakening urgency. Final greenhouse as "cathedral of recollection" integrates setting into thematic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant reunion stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening resonances narrowing to final unification; one decisive cadence shift on longest night forecloses separation with wept losses as cost. Protagonist endurance shows agency under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Devotion-as-promise theme emerges organically from cameo particulars, reweighted non-literally by "There was never a debt, only a promise" into charged final handclasp. Ambiguity of debt lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (whispers to trees) and rhythmic modulation (short peak lines like "You will."); sparse dialogue carries subtext advancing plot. Distinct ghost idiom in "lovingly venomous" voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulative beats; alchemical metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor figurative density ("honey laced with belladonna") in openings, but purposeful and non-pervasive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical haunting and lifetime debt transforms ghost trope via orchard constraints; bead's evolution feels inevitable. Risky accumulative structure heightens reunion stakes organically.</comment>
