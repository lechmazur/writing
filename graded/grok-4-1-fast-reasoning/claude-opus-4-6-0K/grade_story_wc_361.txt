<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's jittery hands create embodied contradiction and feedback loop with the pendant, compelling micro-choices like gloved handling and kneeling; final stillness earns transformation via prior causality. Internal conflict layers nervousness with duty throughout. Flaw (shaking as sensitivity) drives inevitable struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum to glow to seedlings densifies resonance, culminating in CR closure ("That was Tuesday") with conceptual cost of sustained wonder reweighting relic routine. Single scene anchored early (ridgeway, auroras). No orientation debt; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain choices (strapped case warms, forces stop) and charge final image (green leaves trembling with walk). Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects courier priorities. Details evolve causally with pendant interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe delivery amid shakes/feedback) tightens via aurora-deepening to seedlings, narrowing to endurance choice; cost legible in emotional loop break. Accumulative escalation reweights via density, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in sustained attention forecloses nervousness path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sustained attention transforming routine emerges via pendant-seedlings; final image ("carried wonder down") non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting myth/memory fade. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with resonant perceptual signature (vibrations, hums); diction/rhythm modulates from tense to poised. No head-hopping; voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak (seedlings beat). Propulsion aligns with scene urgency; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic fantasy via vibration-seed germination under auroras; transforms courier trope through specific resonance logic. Risk in lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
