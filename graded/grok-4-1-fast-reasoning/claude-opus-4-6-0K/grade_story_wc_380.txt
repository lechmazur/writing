<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to find deleted memories is rooted in specific past ("mother vanished from her own mind") and drives micro-choices like brewing coffee and placing crystals, with embodied emotion in smelling "brine and cognition." Internal conflict emerges in singular impossible drive balanced by competent struggle. Final atlas-building choice earns closure with felt cost in the weighted book.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lantern anomalies to crystal captures, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("book of wildflowers heavy with crystal") with conceptual cost of memory weight made legible. Orientation anchored early (Maren as lantern lighter, whale beached Tuesday). No shards exceed defaults; pattern taught pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber as micro-setting constrains choices ("gravity shift around her ankles") and charges final image via crystal-flower resonance. Sensory hierarchy (salt hush, metallic smell) reflects Maren's priorities, integrated into action. Final lanterns burning steadily mirror settling gravity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries (coffee pattern to crystal faces), narrowing to mother's specific losses with agency in overnight exhumation. Cost legible in effort and uncertain recognition ("see if weight could become recognition"). One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memories' gravity emerges organically from particulars (whale vessel leaking, crystals preserving child's face), reweighted in final image of empty whale versus heavy book without moralizing. Subtext in wildflower timestamps invites ambiguity on restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in grounds/salt, "excavation" of memories). Rhythmic diction modulates (short crisis sentences to humming resonance). No dialogue; elisions (mother off-page) serve drive without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "crystals had grown... spiraling inward" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; figurative language purposeful ("hush so bright it felt architectural") without muddle in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale as memory archive and gravity pockets transforms magical realism tropes via lived details (lantern tilting, coffee map). Risky conceptual integrity (memories settle like tides) heightens stakes to charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
