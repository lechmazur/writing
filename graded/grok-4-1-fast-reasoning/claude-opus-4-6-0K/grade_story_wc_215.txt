<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority concretely embodies contradictory impulses—holding silence as covenant versus releasing via the box—with the astonished recognition at opening crystallizing earned stasis, her flaw (prior silence) complicating and resolving the choice without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density buildup of silence's weight to RR closure in Elara's dissolution into light, reconfiguring options with felt cost of bearable preservation; orientation anchored early in apiaries, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dead hives and stained glass box as micro-settings constrain revelation and charge final image, with sensory selectivity (shimmering heat, fractured light) mirroring perceptual shift from scorched absence to luminous presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of covenant resolution escalates texturally via deepening realizations (ghosts listen, box holds unspoken), agency in opening box foreclosing verbal release with legible emotional cost in settled weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken eloquence emerges organically from particulars (honey words, patient gaze), final image of following light offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature of mute observation biasing toward light/wax/silence; rhythmic diction modulates intensity, compression taught early and legible in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (wax cathedrals, crystallizing honey) accelerating to closure without loops or muddle; read-aloud rhythm varies propulsively, no scaffold in peak box beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts-as-listeners, bee ruins, and stained box transforms apology trope into inevitable conceptual repricing; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
