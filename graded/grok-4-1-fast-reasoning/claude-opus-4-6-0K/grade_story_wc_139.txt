<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction peaks in the breach moment ("She cannot unsee the doorway"), embodied via hands on chest and micro-choice to photograph cartoons, earning her final commitment without unmotivated epiphany. Backstory interleaves concretely with ink pot cue, tilting present stance. Minor diagnostic slips like "rigid thinking" don't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (file, cartoons) builds to CR closure in "She has calculated it finally," reweighting fair trade premise with conceptual cost of her witnessed completion. Single scene oriented early (body arrives Tuesday); no lens ambiguity. Final image ("something stubbornly, deathly alive") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink pot as micro-setting constrains discovery beat and charges final image (placed in hands), with sensory prep room details (fluorescent hum, chemical sharpness) mirroring "deathly vitality." POV filters via professional priorities (washing, positioning). Object evolution ties to thematic cost without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair trade math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cartoon deepening that forces breach, narrowing isolation option with felt personal cost. Agency in active waiting and photographing forecloses clinical distance. Pressure coheres to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fair trade as completion emerges via particulars (Dariush's trades, her parallel doorway), resonating in non-literal final calculation and image without moralizing. Self-portrait shifts motif meaning organically. Counter-reading (father's view) adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors ("mathematics of a fair trade") and biased noticing (dead as honest customers). Rhythm modulates with intensity; no elision or head-hopping. Voice distinct and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-job (e.g., ink pot description advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor reflection density doesn't flatten closure. No loops, muddled metaphors, or scaffold in peak breach beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embalmer's clinical rebellion against con past, charged by cartoonist ink pot's irony; transforms asylum tropes via fair trade lens. Risky quiet CR feels inevitable, heightening stakes through personal parallel without gimmick.</comment>
