<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied details like trembling hand and loud pulse; micro-choices (tucking nail) reveal values with cost; earned change in dread loosening ties to prior causality without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses in "nervously confident hands" act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (Hybrid dominant at end) holds: decoding density reweights stake; CR closure via family map redrawn, cost in "spongey dread... loosening its grip"; orientation anchored early (arrival, station); pivotal tightening at journals' revelation forecloses doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (ozone, wet paper, groaning station) constrains choices (sealing journals); recurring weather charges final image ("jet stream howled its new... song"), mirroring internal redraw; POV-filtered details (radomes like fungi) evolve causally, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover bravery) signaled early, deepens via decoding turn narrowing options; agency in photographing/sealing shows endurance with felt cost (dread softens but carried); pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise closure; moral calculus in honor vs. exile legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths/redrawn maps emerges organically from particulars (coded poetry, nail bookmark); final image ("read... courage... while jet stream howled") offers resonant CR answer reweighting premise without moral; lingering ambiguity in "reversible exile" embraces complexity, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (maps, coordinates bias); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in decoding); purposeful compression legible under lens; no head-hopping, distinct diction fits librarian, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows), no loops/artifacts; specific verbs/nouns propel (pried loose, water-warped); final line recharges motifs cleanly; zero figurative muddle, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coded poetry cipher, shipwreck journals proving resistance transforms tropes; risk in reflective lyricism heightens stakes via weather parallel; inevitable hindsight turn at "collaboration had been a cover," with bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
