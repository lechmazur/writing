<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with motivation rooted in six-year obsession compelling the lever pull; embodied contradictions peak in "icy warmth of this moment." Final endurance of solitude as proof's cost feels earned by prior obliging access-building. Contradictory impulses (patience vs. isolation) act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to hologram bloom as CR, reweighting theory with isolation cost legible in "no one was there to see it." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent, closure on-page with final hull touch. Persistent constraint of twilight window shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hull's "mechanically warm" recurs to constrain perception and charge final image, mirroring internal proof. Sensory hierarchy (hum, frost, wings) selective via mechanic's bias, integrated into lever pause. Environment guides choice through nexus access and creature roosts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove lateral time) signaled early, escalates via hologram spiral under accumulative lens, deepening knowledge with solitude cost. Agency in patient mods and pull narrows options; tightening at "time fanning out like pages" forces stance crystallization. One decisive intensification suffices, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subdued awakening emerges from particulars (hologram proof, alone), final image reweighting "time...moved on in every way" as non-literal CR answer. Theme organic via creature biosignatures and isolation, with ambiguity in indifference. Satisfies 9+ test sans moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close 3rd POV stable, perceptual signature in time/prism metaphors biases noticing (e.g., "cells aged in directions"). Rhythmic control modulates to hush at proof; distinct diction fits mechanic-theorist. 9+ test met: signature holds under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pulse that reminded her of something living"); rhythm varies, no loops or artifacts in peak hologram beat. Metaphors coherent (prism, book), propel without overwriting. Zero scaffold, propulsion clear to closure; 9+ test passed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lateral time via xenobio fresh synthesis, transformed through mechanic's mods and quiet proof; risk in lyric sci-fi heightens isolation stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes. Bold tonal hush rewards (+0.3), satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
