<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with trembling fingers embodying realization; motivation to name intentions drives persistence without epiphany shortcuts; final decision earned via accumulated fragments, foreclosing silence with conceptual cost for the dead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as decoding density builds to CR closure ("They will bury my testimony"); cost legible in velveteen gloom pressing close; orientation anchored in first paragraph (silo, clock, chess).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Starlight column constrains decoding under open roof, charging final upward gaze; cold metal seeps tactile embodiment; cobalt silo and frayed border selective, POV-biased toward precision amid pastoral deceit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding history) signaled early, tightens via northeastern sentence revelation narrowing to Celia's silenced fate; agency in painstaking untangling forecloses ignorance with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of precise stories for dead emerges from tapestry ledger vs. nameless stone; final humming reconfigures loss into growth without moralizing, resonant via particulars like children's roses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (stars as "indifferent witnesses"); rhythmic modulation peaks in velveteen gloom; purposeful compression in decoding legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short revelation sentences vs. flowing images); specific diction like "warp from weft" propels without overwriting, clear under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tapestry cipher as historical ledger transforms dispossession trope via threaded code; fresh synthesis of gardener's lightness and silo's gloom inevitable in CR realization.</comment>
