<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with whimsical voice threading profession into hollowing burden; contradictory impulses peak in weeping recognition at nest, earning shift to "nest builder" with felt emotional cost. Micro-choice to write own words reveals values hierarchy. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via installations to nest spiral, pattern break in letter fragments triggers CR closure ("She pulled a notebook... spiraling outward") with legible cost of prior hollowing reconfigured as weaving strength. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dripping eaves, fat glistening blossoms, prismatic quiet) filtered through Maren's priorities mirror internal translucence post-rain; pond perimeter subtly guides walk to pivotal nest. Recurring temple reflection charges final glow image, constraining reflective closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find thread amid hollowing secrets) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at nest ("chest tighten with recognition") narrowing to writing choice; agency in reading/sitting/weeping forecloses isolation path with emotional cost. Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration tempers peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weaving scattered longings emerges organically from nest/letters mirroring ghostwriting; subtext in released secrets reweights premise. Final image ("wrote... because everything was") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, inviting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with whimsical perceptual signature (metaphors as "ribbons through hair"); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged introspection. No head-hopping; diction controlled and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (taught early as whimsical craft) propels via varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Minor overwriting in opening temple description slightly dulls initial propulsion, but closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nest of deconstructed love letters transforms ghostwriter trope into fresh reunion via public release; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes organically. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable at writing beat.</comment>
