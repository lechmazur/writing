<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (throat ache, ribs hurt); final renunciation of talisman earned by accumulating realizations of sacrifice, with visible cost of lost magic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds to CR closure when ink bleeds and time rushes back, with legible cost in lighter magic; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glade's luminous grass and starlight constrain isolation and charge card draw/saucer placement; final clouds parting as curtains reconfigure descent with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover time) signaled early tightens via daughter's hand image forcing realization/renunciation; unfastening forecloses magic path with on-page cost felt in bellows rush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Saucer crack motif shifts from personal fissure to enabling daughter's growth; final image of uncharted morning non-literally answers sacrifice-as-repentance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (onyx ink swallowing light, grass glowing within); rhythmic control heightens revelation without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "truth arrived like a fist behind the sternum"); no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm supports choking beauty to release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy-time sacrifice transforms postpartum loss trope; risk of lyric CR (talisman bleed) inevitable from ink/cards setup, heightening stakes.</comment>
