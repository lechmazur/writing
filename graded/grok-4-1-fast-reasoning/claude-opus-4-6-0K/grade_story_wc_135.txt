<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maret's reactively visionary trait drives concrete micro-choices like recognizing the valve's mark and restructuring around it, earning her final endurance with the cost of exile's hollowing visibly layered in her sharpened motivation. Osen applies secondary pressure through the archive's decay, heartened by her actions. Internal conflict emerges in navigating ruin as "starting point," not ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density builds from harbor arrival to valve discovery to notebooks spread, delivering Charged Poise closure where her writing reconfigures absences into meaning with felt cost of untended rot and exile. Orientation anchors immediately; one tightening via valve inference holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain constrains choices through salt-corroded shelves and mildew air, mirroring her archival obsessions; recurring wet stone and spray charge the final blank-page image that enables her work. Sensory hierarchy (visual pale gleams, taste of brine) filters via her professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to compile fragments—tightens accumulatively via valve's reweighting of Governor Tessand's loss, narrowing options to "start with what's missing" with felt cost of removed crates and exile. Osen's relief crystallizes her agency in heartening through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning from absences emerges organically via fragments, exile gaps, and valve reprise, with final notebooks offering non-literal reconfiguration of ruin into purpose without moralizing. Subtext in her visionary remapping invites rereading prior voids.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Maret's archival perceptual signature (noticing patina, tide marks, indices) biases details; sparse dialogue natural and goal-pursuing ("We start with what's missing"). Rhythmic control modulates from reflective arrival to precise action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Salt corroded paper, warped bindings" advances world, character, stakes); varied syntax propels accumulatively without loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Final line's image resolves motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist exile returning to textual wreckage, transformed via reactively visionary trait and valve's inference to vanished convoy; risks quiet Charged Poise over confrontation, heightening thematic stakes organically.</comment>
