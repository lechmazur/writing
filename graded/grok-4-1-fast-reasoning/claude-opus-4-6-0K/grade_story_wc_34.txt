<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to connect unspoken needs feels rooted in her balladeer traits and past, with micro-choices like using the plate revealing values under pressure. Interiority embodied in "stones in her chest" and final humming shows earned change without epiphanies. Minor flaw: no strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the singing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from murals to symbols to singing, culminating in Charged Poise closure where murals settle "no longer desperate" with conceptual cost of prior loneliness legible. Orientation anchored immediately in courtyard. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and lightning constrain choices (plate on slick ledge, thunder intervals glow brightest), charging final "silence that felt full." Sensory details selective via Lira's priorities (warm plate, pulsing walls). Body as micro-setting in palm press mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating needs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via new symbols and plate message, forcing Lira's singing agency. Cost visible in ghost's "desperate" murals reconfigured to relief. One deepening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes before plate payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection across silence emerges from particulars like hex heart and ghost's plea, resonating in final "shared language like a lantern" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; ambiguity in ghost's nature lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in code-as-vines noticing; lyrical diction modulates with thunder's "cathedral organ." No dialogue or head-hopping. Voice reflects Lira's wonder without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lightning arcing... silent fork" advances atmosphere and timing). Rhythmic variety in short thunder sentences; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "code can weep" risks muddle but stays coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-in-graffiti and plate-decoder synthesize fresh angle on loneliness, transforming tropes via specific alpine encoding. Final humming as "half hers and half something older" feels inevitable. Risky lyric ascent/descent frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
