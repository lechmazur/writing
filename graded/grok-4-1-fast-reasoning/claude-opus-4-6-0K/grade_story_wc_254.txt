<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary "tremor of certainty... seismic, involuntary" embodies drive distinguishing from confidence, compelling paraphrase with prior causality from ban obedience; flaws like past silence complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from entry to paraphrasing; resonant reconfiguration closure in weeping dissolves boundaries with legible emotional cost on "relief of a boundary dissolved."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt walls refract light into patterns constraining immersion, quartz pillars hum into pulse altering perception; frozen lake charges final image holding breath.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to paraphrase tightens texturally via rising hum and certainty to speaking; agency forecloses silence path with cost felt in weeping relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as thresholds emerges implicitly; final "world... no less whole for having been spoken" reweights premise non-literally with counter-reading ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "grief hums in the body" biases aesthetically, stable compression taught early pays off in closure image without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "ice that remembers being water" propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies to accelerate paraphrasing peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Cloud-shadow poet" premise transforms paraphrase taboo into fresh aesthetic rite; risk of lyric immersion heightens stakes to inevitable boundary dissolution.</comment>
