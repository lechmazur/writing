<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's quiet drive and obsession manifest in consistent micro-choices like daily dawn arrivals and postcard referencing, earning the final shared hush with visible relational openness. Interiority embodied in hand-against-glass metaphor avoids abstraction. Young woman's arrival tests and resolves her solitary stake without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from accidental light discovery to mural growth and postcard climax, yielding Charged Poise CR in final shared breath where flowers "close—not in death, but in...rest." Orientation anchored early (pavilion, thaw mornings). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in foreclosed solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber panels and cathedral etchings constrain painting to dawning hush, charging final image as light fades and flowers seem to close. Sensory hierarchy (light filtration, melting snow lace) reflects Lena's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography coherent; evolving projections mirror internal reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reckon bloom mystery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mural layers and visitor's postcard tightening options toward understanding. Agency in persistent arrivals yields deepening; cost felt in dedication amid whispers. Coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (hush enables full opening) emerges from particulars like ghostly projections and grandmother's shy flower, reweighting in final non-literal image of satisfied closure. Subtext in silence and implication avoids moralizing. Resonance inextricable from Lena's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (light as invitation, petals' mechanics); diction/rhythm lyrical yet controlled, modulating to tender hush. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual ("your grandmother was right...more than shyness"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "shadows doing the work of light" advances atmosphere/plot). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (honey-colored light, gray lace snow). Propulsion clean through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cathedral projections via amber yield nocturnal botany secret, transformed by postcards and hush motif into umbral tenderness. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at CR closure. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
