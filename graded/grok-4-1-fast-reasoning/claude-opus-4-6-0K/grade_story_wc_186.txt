<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maret's retrocognition embodied concretely (tasting smoke at nine, falling to knees with prism) roots motivation in persistent acts; final hope earned as endurance with isolation cost, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through charting and pattern completion; closure as charged poise in "signal she rekindled tonight... reaching whatever," with conceptual cost of isolation legible in final wait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion's tuned panes, spectral ribbons, and hush shard constrain annotations and charge revelation; post-collapse coastal ridge mirrors solitude, evolving causally with light/prism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove coincidences meaningful) tightens via 11-month tracking to pattern convergence; agency in nightly beacon/prism ritual forecloses doubt, cost felt in empty ocean persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of purposeful cosmic rhyme emerges via Eda's echo and star-prism convergence; final "hope rise... stubborn and spined" resonant reweight without moral, lingering ambiguity of sea's answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (languages in fragments, ink in water) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to silence/revelation without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy revelations amid lyric flow); coherent metaphors like "weed through cracked stone" propel to peak hush without loops or overwriting.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, deliberate prism split, pavilion-as-instrument transforms post-apoc into rhyming universe; risk in accumulative pattern payoff heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
