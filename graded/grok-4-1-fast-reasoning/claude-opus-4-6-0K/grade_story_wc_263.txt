<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in sediment calcifying imagination versus desperate creation drive earned change; final hands "itching with the old electricity" seals renunciation of force with visible cost. Interiority concrete and particular throughout, no stock epiphanies. Backstory anchors tilt present stakes without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to RR closure; "She heard it then -- not the unspoken words of others, but her own voice" delivers on-page reconfiguration with sediment-release cost. Orientation anchored immediately in archway/aurora. Single scene fits defaults, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and astrolabe constrain alignment/sitting choices and charge final dawn-shadowed image; sensory hierarchy (light warmth, hum) mirrors internal release via POV bias. Spatial choreography coherent, evolves causally with events. Micro-setting elevates pivotal hum/prism moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity from sediment) signaled early, deepens via agency in raising astrolabe/sitting under Accumulative lens; one cadence shift to "rest" narrows options with emptiness cost felt in drifting ash. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rest-as-fallow emerges organically from sediment/light interplay; final "emptiness inside her felt less like loss and more like canvas" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of prior accumulation. No moralizing, ambiguity in ongoing hearing lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (unspoken frequencies, stardust resonance); rhythmic modulation heightens release beat without head-hopping or leakage. Lyrical diction consistent, perceptual bias selective and embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration (e.g., "colors struck her chest with physical warmth"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative layer purposeful and coherent under accumulative pattern. Propulsion peaks cleanly at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hearing-unspoken-as-cage with stardust/archway transforms mystical tropes via grounded embodiment; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. Final canvas-empty reversal inevitable from particulars.</comment>
