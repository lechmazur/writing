<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Main tuner's cryptic patience and micro-choices (returning shoe with tea) reveal traits under skepticism, earning her endurance; townfolk add pressure without diluting focus. Limited interior contradiction caps below 9; no impulses act simultaneously on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footsteps map frequencies, density builds to collective rhythm and final fork strike reconfiguring silence as RR/Charged Poise. "Collapse of emptiness" lands closure with conceptual cost of departure felt in fading rhythm; orientation anchored early via archway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain mapping/rebuilding choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, hums) reflects tuner's priorities. Faces shifting with light subtly mirrors town states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town revival) signaled early, escalates via day2 collective joining tightening density under accumulative lens to river shift/bell ring. Agency in strikes narrows silence's hold; her unthanked departure forecloses relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resonant restoration emerges from particulars (fork hum to bell cascade), final "Vareth... a bell, still ringing" reweights silence without moralizing. River's return and caravan reprise ghost-town premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature biases to vibrations/rhythms; cryptic dialogue ("What does the bell call you?") carries subtext and idiom distinct from mayor's bitterness. Rhythmic prose modulates to hush then cascade without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax breathes with twilight walks to peak ring; no loops, metaphors (faces' patience) cohere without muddle. "Wild hush... trembling with presence" passes ear test, charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town trope via sonic revival premise, footsteps/fork synthesis inevitable in hindsight; risky lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
