<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene (considers hiding but opens door), earning the final surrender with embodied cost (no joke, no deflect). Interiority concrete and particular, with "She told herself a lot of things" revealing pathology without diagnostic labels. Flaw of desperate jocularity complicates choices authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards build density to Charged Poise closure ("All right. Tell me where and when"), reconfiguring isolation with legible cost (path foreclosed). Orientation anchored early (railway station outside Velden). Rumor chain motivates arrival without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-covered station constrains choice (hiding option weighed) and charges final image ("ivy shifted... closing over the place"). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (green throat, peppermint tea). Micro-object (moon rock) mirrors internal reciprocity web.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. reciprocity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Petra's letter forcing stance crystallization. Agency in surrender forecloses hiding path with on-page cost (pocketed rock, folded letter). Escalation coherent under lens, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically from particulars (moon rock debt, Udo's letter), reweighted in final image ("Somewhere ahead, a table was being set") without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (holds rock to light) invites ambiguity on loneliness cure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (jocular puns like "Platform Nowhere"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("That's emotional blackmail" / "That's reciprocity"), distinguishing voices. Rhythmic control modulates from desperate humor to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy jokes to flowing reflections), no loops or scaffolds. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Final line recharges ivy motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost logistician bound by rumor/reciprocity, transformed via moon rock and ivy reclamation. Risky quiet surrender heightens emotional stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
