<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via astronomy analogies and embodied polishing; motivation rooted in past grief compels sharing light. Contradictory impulses subtle, not acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats. Final endurance of earthbound life earned with visible cost in closure sitting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from polishing to placement to lantern extinction. Orientation anchored early in grotto. Closure as Charged Poise in "grotto filled with a light so soft it felt like memory itself made visible," reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost of tethering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's mist and moss constrain no-fire rule and charge final image. Sensory details (breathing mist, bioluminescent glow) filtered through POV's star-watcher bias. Calcite shelf enables placement, mirroring internal stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through polishing/placement. Agency in micro-choices narrows to tomorrow's opening; cost legible in past grief transformed. Quiet escalation fits lens without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of non-burning light emerges from sea glass refractions answering astronomy loss. Final image reweights premise: "earthbound stars come alive" as non-literal resonance without moral. Subtext in memories avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (nebulae to polishing analogy). Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically; no head-hopping. Prose as character: syntax breathes with grotto's mist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "small green sunrise") without muddle in peak placement beats. Propulsion aligns with meditative pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ex-astronomer polishes sea glass for underground constellations transforms tropes organically. Risk in lyric closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
