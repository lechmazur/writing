<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through paddle resistance and drift pause mirroring past error; contradictory impulses act in resisting current like Aleutian miscalculation. Final endurance of imperfection ("Close enough") earned by causal buildup of pole-tracked progress. Minor diagnostic edge in "heart and action had split" but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory buildup from launch chop to pause confirmation reconfigures trust with legible cost in accepting deviation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Brewer's Point, kayak launch). Closure as Charged Poise in compass needle settling, whispering acceptance—cost felt in foreclosed precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Utility poles and current constrain navigation choices, charging pause ("exactly where she estimated"); basalt stack provides lee for pivotal compass moment. Sensory hierarchy navigator-specific (pole numbers peripheral, water dialogue). "Merrily melancholic" morning sets tone without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realign heart/action sans tech) signaled early, tightens via current opposition and pole confirmation forcing endurance. Agency in micro-choices (angle strokes, pause drift) culminates in heart-steered turn home. Cost unmistakable in whisper accepting imperfection over past instrument betrayal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect navigation emerges organically via poles vs. stars, poles vs. instruments; final image ("letting her heart steer") non-literally reweights premise without moral. Compass reprise shifts from neglect to heartbeat echo. Counter-reading lingers in deviation's "honest imperfection."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature navigator-biased (pole tags, current feel); rhythmic modulation accelerates in chop, breathes in pause. No head-hopping or elision debt. Prose syntax reflects building faith under physical stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "current tried to push her south... as if the ocean remembered" advances stakes/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (swells building, hull split). Zero figurative muddle in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: utility poles as anti-tech nav transforms redemption arc via father's trick into heart-led closure. Magnetic north acceptance risks quiet stasis over dramatic fix, heightening stakes organically. No template echoes; particular Oregon coast details anchor.</comment>
