<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through embodied covenant costs, with contradictory impulses (repair despite personal decay) culminating in the tethering choice that forecloses health for daughter's voice. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in the repair beat, not summarized. Backstory anchors to present via gloved hand, tilting stakes without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: descent → flawless box inspection → chip placement → tethering → melody → daughter's note, delivering DC closure ("Lenka opened her mouth... his name") with felt cost ("knuckles swell, molar loosen"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains via amplification ("low throb... pressed against eardrums") and charges closure image (throb → melody → silence released). Sensory hierarchy (sound pooling, dripping) reflects Elias's priorities; body as micro-setting (gloved hand, aching joints) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim voice) signaled early, tightens via tethering reversal that narrows options with physical price ("years drain... back bent"), driven by agency under causal lens. Cost unmistakable in "covenant shuddered through him," altering tactics to desperate closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of entropy balance emerges organically from rust covenant and repair, reweighted in final image ("rust, for once, waited") without moralizing. Particulars (invisible mending, stolen light) yield resonant non-literal answer to theft/restoration question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (sound as "physical thing -- pooling... shimmering"); diction/rhythm modulate under pressure (short sentences in tethering: "The cost was immediate and steep"). No elision or head-hopping; texture distinct and biased to tinker's ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "mended what wasn't torn... invisible distance between a note and its meaning" packs character/world/theme); no loops, coherent metaphors (sound/light cousins), rhythm accelerates in climax ("The music box began to play. Not the simple lullaby..."). Zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosopher's stone chip into rust covenant transforms repairman trope; risk in fantasy-literary blend (wilting lies, sound cathedral) heightens stakes organically. Premise inevitable in hindsight via gloved-hand particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
