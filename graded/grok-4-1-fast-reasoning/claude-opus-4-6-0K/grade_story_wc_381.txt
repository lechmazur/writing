<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation rooted in burden/gift compels micro-choices like folding amid resistance, earning stasis in final endurance; embodied listening and stiff knees ground interiority without labels. Contradictory impulses surface in prophecy's pushback versus her hush. Final choice to walk away forecloses propagation with solitude's cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through folding silences to pattern break at wing-to-water, yielding RR (Charged Poise) as prophecy dissolves into blank wing and senseless murmurs. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Cost in "silence... for as long as someone was willing to listen harder" reconfigures burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook's currents constrain tactics as "living notation" carrying counter-resonance; moonlight, wing, and knees charge final image of erasure. Sensory selection (murmurs over roar) reflects perceptual bias. Purposeful, tactile integration avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early tightens accumulatively: resistance thrum yields to pulse at "pressed the folded wing to the water's surface," narrowing options via her attention-agency. Cost unmistakable in valley's hush and her circling blood. Lens-driven escalation forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of refusal's mercy emerges organically from particulars like origami creases and dissolving syllables; final "water-words, senseless and beautiful" reweights gift as solitary listening without moralizing. Complexity in willful prophecies lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in silence-pockets and hush-architecture; rhythmic modulation peaks at "tranquil blaze igniting," distinct texture in syntax like "leaning into the silence between water-sounds." Elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (ripples in reverse, architecture of hush) without muddle in climax; varied rhythm breathes with scene. Minor figurative density at peak ("warmth without violence") borders overwrite but patterns payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami-summoning silence transforms prophecy trope via grounded listening-tactics; bold lyric risk in hush-architecture heightens stakes, inevitable in blank-wing reprise.</comment>
