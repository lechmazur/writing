<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory skepticism and tactile expertise drive micro-choices like feeling the tooth's "faint wrongness," earning her final faith with embodied cost tied to her daughter's loss. Interiority particular via bone metaphors under grief-pressure. 9+ test met: impulses clash in garden beat, choice forecloses doubt-path visibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from maze to garden impossibilities to tooth realization, landing Charged Poise closure as Maren "set her hands against the oak's bark" with conceptual cost of fractured certainty. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices. Cost legible in "permission to forgive herself."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's sensory anomalies (November roses, midday stars) constrain discovery and charge final image, filtered through bone-setter's tactile bias. Oak roots nest tooth/child-cry, mirroring internal fractures purposefully. 9+ gate: setting shapes tooth beat and oak-listening closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend certainty via child/restoration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via garden/tooth deepening that narrows skeptic-options, agency in picking tooth and listening. Cost unmistakable: faith forecloses rational wall-stance. Under lens, density reweights with felt grief-price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone-fracture motif emerges organically, reweighting skepticism to "faith" in final image without statement. Resonant answer to certainty-theme via "fractures ask to be set with faith." 9+ test: non-literal closure reconfigures premise-particulars indelibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with tactile perceptual signature ("reading its truth through her fingertips"); voice modulates poetically yet grounded in craft-idiom. Britta dialogue subtextual/natural. No head-hopping; diction/rhythm heighten pressure to charged oak-beat. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops/artifacts dull peak (tooth/garden vivid, un-muddled). Minor figurative density in garden fits taught pattern without obscuring "cleft in her certainty." Propulsion clear, zero scaffold in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms changeling-trope via bone-setter's grief-fusion, fresh "constellations" from mistakes. Risky lyric accrual pays off in inevitable faith-repricing. No derivative hedging; synthesis organic/memorable.</comment>
