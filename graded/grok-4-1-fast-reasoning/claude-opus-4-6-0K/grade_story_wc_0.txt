<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority fuses astrophysics models with embodied greenhouse labor; contradictory impulses peak in butterfly moment where scales force unfiltered presence, earning final filter renunciation with vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via dust patterns to butterfly tightening; CR closure in "Humility...one more pattern in the dust" reconfigures preprocessing with conceptual cost of distributed significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silt-dust layers constrain daily observations and charge final light-across-floor image; sensory hierarchy (wet earth/jasmine vs. stellar data) reflects analytical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (presence vs. preprocessing) deepens accumulatively through slug trails to butterfly reversal, narrowing to humility trade-off; cost legible in choosing "presence" over efficiency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gradual decay/revelation theme emerges via dust-star-butterfly chain; final tarp-flap/light image resonantly reweights personal collapse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scientific compression ("diffraction grating") biases perception toward patterns; rhythmic modulation peaks in reflective sitting, stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density layers insight into action (e.g., "scales so small they were almost conceptual"); varied syntax propels to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Neutron star/greenhouse silt synthesis transforms healing trope; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via irreplaceable butterfly-dust bridge.</comment>
