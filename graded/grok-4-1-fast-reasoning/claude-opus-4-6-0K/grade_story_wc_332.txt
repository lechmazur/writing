<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through tremor-embodied loss and micro-choices like tinting photos with imperfect hands; final endurance earned as she touches palette post-validation, foreclosing return to old life with exile's ongoing cost. Contradictory impulses (can't discard palette yet mixes anew) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo density builds to cipher pattern, curator's arrival as cadence shift reconfigures absence into atlas; Charged Poise closure in "opened the library... waited in the dark" with legible cost of stubborn waiting. Orientation anchored early in cabin/islands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palette and dock constrain choices (tinting, dawn waits) and charge final image; sensory details (fog exhale, salt-warped shelves) filtered through Maren's artistic bias mirror internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via photo sequence to cipher realization ("you do not chase it"), tightening options to patient endurance; agency in interleaving logbooks forces trade-off of imperfection, cost felt in "trembling fingers leaving edges."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of luminous absence emerges organically from island cipher and tinted photos; final image ("palette... half-empty, pigment given to the sea") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loss as vitalized cartography without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in painterly observations ("horizon as baseline"); curator's dialogue natural/subtextual, advances closure; rhythmic modulation heightens predawn hush without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The images accumulated. Dozens, then hundreds."); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent and voice-motivated, zero figurative muddle in peak curator beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-artist exile via island cipher/sunrise "painting"; transforms recovery trope through specific tremor/light pivot and "atlas of luminous absence," risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitability.</comment>
