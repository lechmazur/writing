<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Choir members' traits shine via physics of tension/release and brothers' glance as earned micro-change; Marguerite's motivation clear but interiority lighter, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise/CR closure in rosette/silence/leaf image; conceptual cost of ephemerality legible in "exists only now, only in the room."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet library acoustics constrain singing stakes; rosette as micro-setting charges final image, sensory details (ember light, tuned silence) purposeful and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vanishing arts tightens accumulatively via hymn's polyphony and brothers' glance pattern-break; cost of impermanence felt without resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ephemera as form emerges via rosette speech, singing physics, final silence; leaf image non-literally reweights vanishing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("silence you could almost tune"); rhythmic control modulates stillness to harmony seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "braided around one another like rivers entering a delta"); varied rhythm propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vocal physics unlearning hatred and vanishing arts; risk in lyric compression inevitable in rosette/leaf closure.</comment>
