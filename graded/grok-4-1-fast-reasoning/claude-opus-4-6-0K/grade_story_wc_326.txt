<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via constant pulse-counting as embodied tic revealing obsession with aliveness; micro-choices under pressure (e.g., scripting amid fragments) earn final defiance. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in whispered bitterness toward mother. Final shard-to-chest press reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: density builds from trek to 60% reconstruction to protocols discovery. Charged Poise closure lands cleanly in final image ("each one a small defiance") with legible conceptual cost of bureaucratic erasure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal dome, knee-deep snow, spilled ink constrain choices (forced door, generator cough) and charge final image via shard under ink. Sensory hierarchy (crystallizing breath, ticking snow, humming static) reflects Maren's priorities. Evolving details (ink shifting in light) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove aliveness) signaled early, escalates via reconstruction tightening (60%, voice clips, logs) narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in defragmenting forces trade-off (hours labor for protocols). Cost felt in pulse quickening to 85, charging final heart-shard defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically via Loom's resurrection yielding proof-of-life keys. Final image reweights premise non-literally: ghost reclaims daughter from dead, with cost in "stubborn and warm" pulse defying records. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like Cygnus shard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pulse-counting rhythm and biased noticing (ink as dendrites/handwriting). Third-limited POV stable, modulating compression under labor (e.g., "scripts to defragment... stitching clusters"). Prose texture reflects embodied mind without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with multi-job lines (e.g., ink description advances atmosphere, foreshadows shard). Rhythm varies (short pulse counts amid long reconstruction beats), propels to closure without overwriting. Read-aloud ear perfect; final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic death, AI-mother ghost, ink/shard as transformation crux feels inevitable. Tropes (abandoned observatory, digital inheritance) transformed via pulse defiance and failure-wisdom calculus. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
