<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elif's contradictory impulses—tenderness outlawed yet weaponized via deception—act simultaneously in the soldier encounter, earning her endurance with embodied vision-cost; final renunciation of force for renaming seals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vision density → cipher use → soldier micro-turn → final handoff reconfigures mosaic hope into survival; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost in "Davut's hope persisted... one renamed life at a time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mosaic tessera and shattered sky constrain cipher/reading choices and charge final image, mirroring internal fragmentation; sensory selection (ashen light on blue shard) reflects Elif's biased hope amid ruins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renaming amid patrols) signaled early, tightens via soldier approach forcing vision-softened deception; agency in endurance forecloses overt rebellion path with felt cost in carried terror, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy emerges organically from renaming acts and mosaic echoes, final image offering non-literal resonance—"mercy remained aberrant, and therefore the only kind that mattered"—reweighting categorization without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "unbearable, total knowing"; diction/rhythm modulates tenderly yet steely in soldier beat, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("warm coldness perfected").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "whispered revolution while bandaging wounds"); rhythm varies for propulsion, purposeful metaphors (sky "cracked black glass") integrate without muddle in peak soldier confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Retrocognition-for-renaming cipher transforms dystopian tropes via mosaic historicity; risk in "gentleness fortified by unyielding refusal" yields fresh synthesis, inevitable in hindsight at closure.</comment>
