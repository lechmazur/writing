<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between resentment and cellular memory act vividly in visions; final pick-up of music box earns renunciation with embodied cost in "chest cracked open." Scheming pacifist woman's traits compel Maren's shift through calculated orchestration. No diagnostic labels dilute peak; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions densify pattern to Charged Poise RR closure where gap becomes "a rest in the music," reconfiguring resentment with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchors instantly at grave-to-sanctuary; one tightening via hospital vision pays off without micro turns. Pattern taught early in soundless crank.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Music box as micro-setting constrains choices across visions, charging final image; soundless sanctuary pressures via felt vibrations in "tissue and bone." Sensory hierarchy embodies POV urgency, narrowing to pulses in fingertips/throat. No white-room; ripples/tilts evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resentment) tightens accumulatively via visions forcing attention/renunciation; woman's orchestration narrows options to acceptance. Cost unmistakable in "eleven years in a single, soundless exhale." One deepening suffices; agency in Maren's crank-turn forecloses grudge path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete songs reweighting resentment emerges from particulars like broken pin; final image offers non-literal answer via "gap did not feel like betrayal." Subtext in woman's cello-resonant words threads organically. Minor friction: near-thesis line ("Resentment is a song...") borders echo but serves embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases to bodily memory ("behind her sternum"); rhythmic control heightens surreal pressure in shifts. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven via bone-resonance; distinct idioms despite minimal lines. No head-hopping; voice modulates elegantly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with propulsion in "vibration died before it could become wave." Rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax breathes with visions; opening anchors stakes perfectly. Figuratives purposeful, no muddle in peaks like "tectonic plates finally releasing pressure."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory, soundless surrealism, and pacifist intervention transforms forgiveness trope; risk in non-causal Accumulative drive heightens stakes. Irreplaceable pin-as-rest reconfigures organically. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
