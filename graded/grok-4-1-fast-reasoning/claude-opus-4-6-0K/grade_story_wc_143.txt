<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "dawnlit melancholy" reflection, revealing contradictory love of the leaving; canister micro-choices earn final endurance with descent cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure; light "sky split" at 0547 reconfigures darkness loss with grain's final image as legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grain vial as micro-setting evolves from moonlight "pale fire" to "eternal light" monument, constraining reflection and charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture last darkness tightens via timed exposure and light arrival; agency in canister placement endures with "eyes burning... from everything the light replaced" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of darkness's worth emerges via particulars; grain's "smallest monument" final image non-literally reweights human erasure without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature in biased noticing like "curtain of gold flung"; rhythmic modulation heightens hush to brilliance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffolds; high density propels via countdown ("0541... 0547") and sensory shifts without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sci-fi premise of orbital mirrors erasing shadows ingeniously transforms loss trope; grain-canister synthesis risks quiet CR payoff effectively.</comment>
