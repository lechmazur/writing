<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's precisely humane trait compels the gathering and report, earning communal reclamation with cost of water's return; Marta's expunged memory resurfaces embodied via the photo touch, driving her pinning action as micro-choice hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as artifacts (chime silence to photos to gathering) densify remembrance stake; closure Charged Poise in chime's transformed song reconfigures mourning with legible cost of rising water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reservoir's dropping silver and algae-steeple constrain viewing before dark and gathering site, charging final chime image; sensory hush and twilight blade-asphalt filter through heritage bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of reclaiming before refill tightens via photo-memory pivot narrowing options to communal act; agency in organizing gathering forecloses isolation with time-cost of repairs, felt in "before the water comes back."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silt-stories into shared air emerges implicitly from artifacts passing hands; final "town remembering itself, note by copper note" non-literally reweights submersion premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature biases toward hushed heritage (e.g., "finger pointing at heaven"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual advances stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops; purposeful figures like "water seeping through a crack" integrate without muddle in peak photo beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost town's resurfacing artifacts synthesize loss/remembrance freshly, transforming flood trope via communal Polaroids and report addendum; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
