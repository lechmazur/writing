<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (quick forgiveness vs. patience) act in scene via over-trim and diffused cuts; final renunciation of concentrated grief earned by Oren's critique and lace, with embodied cost in "sorrow" spread through tree.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure; compass needle's steady north in final beat makes relational cost legible as uncertain endurance toward mother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass as recurring micro-setting constrains choice (kept on table) and charges final image beside lace; slick post-rain islet subtly mirrors internal "weather" of silence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology's color) signaled early tightens texturally via Oren's "too much" → lace patterns → diffuse cuts; agency in first deliberate cut forecloses hasty path with felt sorrow-cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "uncertain, tender, in-between shade" resonantly answers central question of apology's form without moral; emerges organically from bonsai cuts, lace motifs, and tides simile reweighting silence as full, not empty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in color/nature filters (cerulean sky, green-darkened juniper); Oren's tidal dialogue distinct from Maren's introspective rhythm, subtextual in "forgive you faster than it can."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., breeze lifts lace while tracing patterns); rhythmic variety peaks in final cuts paragraph without loops, metaphors coherent (silence as weather, tides of memory).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lace-woven instructions synthesize bonsai patience and familial silence into fresh CR; risky lyric accumulation of color/tide/reef images heightens stakes inevitably toward "willingness to remain present."</comment>
