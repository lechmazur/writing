<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (calcified "never" vs. aching motivation) act in scene through cataloguing and glass study, earning the final choice to drive on with visible cost of resurrection's disbelief; minor abstract phrasing like "pixelated amnesty" doesn't flatten embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vanishing to glass coordinates realization, landing Charged Poise closure ("pulled back onto the mountain road") with felt cost of breaking "never"; orientation anchored early, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring glass flake constrains choices (study, hold to light) and charges final image blazing in sunset; sensory hierarchy (warmth, ether smell, smoke-blue layers) reflects fiddler's observant bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome "never") signaled early via hitchhiker question, deepens accumulatively through glass's future self-image narrowing options to sculpt possibility; cost legible in "luminous disbelief" foreclosing past renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented rebirth emerges organically from glass shards reassembling "never" into amnesty, final fiddle hum reweighting fire's ashes without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (bridge-reader noticing micro-tensions, scaffold symbols) with rhythmic control; stable close-3rd POV, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm ("sky turned the color of a struck match"); zero loops, metaphors cohere (glass developing like "never"), no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate photo trapping future self on scaffold-coded bridge transforms vanishing trope into pixelated rebirth; risk of ghostly physics heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
