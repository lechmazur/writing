<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the opening (turn back to village vs. follow fog) and propel micro-choices like descending the trail; final release of ashes and unsaid words ("love and anger and gratitude and sorrow") is earned through prior grief buildup with embodied cost. Guides apply precise pressure via father's history. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog/paths/station build density to RR closure at shore where ashes spread "like a whisper finally released," reconfiguring waiting to action with emotional cost legible in "brave and stumbling and true." Orientation anchored early (ridgeway, dusk, island). One tightening via station revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ridgeway fog/heather/stone corridors constrain choices (forks lead to station, descent trail "wound gently"); final image charged by ridge lights as "stars punched through the dark" mirroring ticket. Sensory hierarchy (wind notes, wave cadence) reflects Maren's perceptual bias toward sea/father. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release father via ashes amid grief) signaled early (urn weight, procrastination); accumulative deepening via guides' words narrows to unsaid courage, foreclosing delay with agency in scattering/speaking. Cost unmistakable in emotional layering ("love and anger"). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid courage emerges organically from leash break freeing dog/Maren, guides' ferry metaphor, to final reconfiguration without moralizing. Resonant answer in shoreline image: "no longer waiting," reweighting prior delays. Subtext in persistent wave cadence avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (wave-like rhythms in noticing); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (guides punch stars while revealing father, advancing stakes). Lyrical diction controlled, modulates with descent intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fog parted -- deliberate, almost inviting"); rhythm varies (short descent sentences build to long release). Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (leash frees, stars punched, whisper released). Propulsion peaks flawlessly at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridge "passage ferries" transforms liminal grief trope into fresh, non-obvious synthesis of vigil/courage/unsaid, with star-ticket reprise heightening stakes organically. Bold indirect routes and ferry station feel inevitable in hindsight. No template echoes; singular vision.</comment>
