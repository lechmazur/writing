<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion peaking in "pressed the seed against her chest and felt it pulse faintly," earning the final planting choice; contradictory impulses (desperate search vs. methodical acceptance) act simultaneously in translation beat. Final renunciation of direct reunion feels compelled by Tariq's ambition haunting her "ribs like a second skeleton."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed discovery to inscription revelation, culminating in CR closure as planting reconfigures transition ("not departure... change in resonance") with emotional cost legible in "whispered Tariq's name." Orientation anchored early; no shards, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor constrains choice ("pressed into a fissure where two field lines converged") and charges final image ("hum travel through her kneecaps"); sensory hierarchy (humming teeth, ozone) filtered through scholar's priorities, vivid and purposeful without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map brother's transition) signaled early, deepens via translation reversal changing knowledge ("vibrating at a frequency the arbor could no longer hold"); agency in planting forecloses direct answers with felt cost, tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over absence emerges organically from inscription particulars, final image ("clouds shifted like pages turning") offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing; haunted ambitions inextricable from arc, ambiguity lingers in her learning "to read" frequencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in analogical noticing ("curved like the sign for 'water' but... extra vertical"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, POV stable and biased toward cuneiform patterns; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("She turned the knowledge fruit seed in her palm and began to read"), varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent and sparse in peak (translation), enhancing without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform spirits and magnetic physics transforms tropes (ghost story → resonance model); risk in arbor's sci-fi logic pays off inevitably at planting, heightening emotional stakes without gimmick.</comment>
