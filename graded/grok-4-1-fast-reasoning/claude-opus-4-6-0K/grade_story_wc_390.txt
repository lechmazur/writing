<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses ("logically emotional" shown in calculating yet weeping); final endurance earned through micro-choices like painful humming that forecloses forcing the original pitch. No safety-hedging; flaws like emotional vulnerability drive the climax adaptation with visible physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: vibration density builds from muddied tone to locked harmony as Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost (throat ache, freezing sweat). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality tightens via matching-then-raising without breaks. Closure image ("sonic absolution") reconfigures stakes indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and body-as-microsetting constrain choices (groaning ice listens, golden light window narrows time); sensory hierarchy (vibrations in teeth/sternum) reflects engineer's bias. Final image charges with ice stilling under thinning light. Purposeful selectivity avoids catalog; tactile lived-in nav (frost-slicked stairs) perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retune Stone to hold marina) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via painful matching resistance then synchronization under agency. One decisive deepening forecloses forcing pitch, with legible costs (eyes water, marina groans). Coherent pressure crystallizes stance in kneeling release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of consonance amid breaking emerges organically from vibrational matching, answered non-literally in shared "third voice" reweighting logic/emotion duality. No moralizing; final realization ("some things endure... sing them back") charges prior particulars without platitude. Ambiguity lingers in belief shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (bodily resonances as ancient marrow pull); rhythmic modulation heightens climax intensity. Prose texture distinct (e.g., "fleshly and ethereal"); no elision or head-hopping. Voice embodies engineer's logically emotional lens flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with propulsion (e.g., "struck the key... held the key near" advances cleanly). Metaphors coherent/purposeful ("warm water" vibration); varied rhythm peaks in "Sonic absolution" cadence. Read-aloud flawless, no overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics-resonance myth (voice-tuning ice-heart Stone) transforms eco-salvation trope via "vibrational matching" logic. Risky flesh-ethereal tone heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from key-as-fork setup. No derivatives; singular vision.</comment>
