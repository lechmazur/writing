<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in brother's fall anchor every micro-choice, with serene anger embodied as "burning coal" calcified into composure; final reconfiguration earns closure via prior causality without tidy epiphany. Contradictory persistence despite isolation shows flaw complicating choices. Hairline slip in brief diagnostic phrasing ("brain's insistence") but dramatized with trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchors immediately ("Sable crouched at the edge of the wind-carved encampment"); closure as CR in ink figure dissolving with "slowly when witnessed," reweighting premise with emotional cost felt in unchanged grief transformed to light. One tightening via progressive vials narrows perception to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment and spiraling currents constrain choices by mirroring ink fractals, charging final image; post-eclipse "wrong" light jolts perception as micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy (eyes narrowing, wind chord) reflects tracker's bias. Body/ink as recurring "setting" evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why time slows) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vial stages where "branching pattern slowed" forces perceptual deepening under lens; agency in wild methods yields CR closure with cost in persistent grief. Trembling hands make price visible; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of crisis as "deepest form of attention" emerges organically from ink mirroring fall, reweighting premise in final image without statement—"dissolve the way all moments dissolve, slowly when witnessed." Complexity lingers in unextinguished coal; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in fractal noticing ("ephemeral architectures"); rhythmic control modulates from serene to dilated ("wind becoming a low chord"). Lyrical compression taught early via ink pays off legibly at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring time dilation (short sentences in peak: "She poured the third and final vial."); figurative language purposeful ("bruised sky," "heated glass") without muddle in peaks. Read-aloud rhythm perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perceptual science, grief, and ink fractals transforms trope of slowed time into tracker's quest; risk in "consciously wild" methods heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from eclipse timing to lightened coal; no templates.</comment>
