<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through synesthetic perceptions like "color was sound," rooting motivation in consistent traits; micro-choices like aligning the sheet and humming escalate with embodied cost. Final weeping and climb earn change without epiphany dumps. Contradictory impulses surface in balancing silence's weight against singing compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup to aurora release forms CR closure, reweighting wonder's premise with proof's conceptual cost in "sky above the cathedral would be burning." Orientation anchored early via glacier climb; no shard excess. Cost legible in "wept, not from sadness but...relief of proof."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern and hush constrain choices via vibration and stillness, charging final resonance; synesthetic details like aurora ribbons as pitches filter through POV bias. Micro-setting (hush figure) mirrors internal hush-breaking. Evolves causally from tremble to ring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) signaled via aldermen, tightens accumulatively through hush discovery to aurora singing, narrowing to voice-weaving agency; cost in tremble's risk and emotional release forecloses ornamental view. Escalation driven by her matching tones, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: hush as "structural" wonder reweights premise non-literally in final "oscillating repose" image, inviting ambiguity without moralizing. No overt statements; irony in aldermen's silence charges resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("shimmer of light...as a chord") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from hush's stillness to ringing release. Stable limited third-person; no elision or head-hopping. Voice as character: lyric texture reflects prism-ringer mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "silence cracked—not shattered, but unfastened"; varied rhythm propels from hush to exhalation without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "knot loosens"), no muddle in climax. Ear-test clean, propulsion peaks at "cavern rang like a bell."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia + glacial hush + prismatic bells synthesize fresh premise; risk in lyric accumulative drive transforms wonder trope organically. Final reconfiguration ("carrying silence and sound") inevitable from hush motif, heightening stakes via sensory rule-set.</comment>
