<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steadily adaptive trait shown concretely through frost-reading like molten glass, with internal conflict (revenge vs. pauses) acting in scene; earned shift to purpose culminates in cache moment without unearned epiphany. Minor abstract phrasing ("purpose lived there") borders therapy-speak but embodied in burns and choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns build density to Charged Poise closure: rolling ledgers and walking deeper reconfigures stance with felt cost of reformation in "silence held its breath." Orientation anchored early; one tightening (cleft discovery) suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost patterns constrain choice to carved symbol and cache, charging final canyon image; sensory hierarchy (visual frost, resonant wind "like glass singing") reflects glass-artist POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering for purpose) signaled early, tightens via frost-deepening to cache reversal narrowing revenge/path options; cost legible in patient adaptation versus fixed destination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of liminal purpose emerges organically from frost vanishing and glass motifs shifting to "light must first pass through something broken"; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting survival premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (transformation as "frequency," glass/frost analogies) modulates rhythm under reflective pressure; stable close-third POV biases details purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and purposeful figuratives (e.g., "frost feathering along cracks"); no loops or artifacts, even in peak cache beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry, frost cartography, and smugglers transforms survival trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes via irreplaceable canyon-glass metaphors.</comment>
