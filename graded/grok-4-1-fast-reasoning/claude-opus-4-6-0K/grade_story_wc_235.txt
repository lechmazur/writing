<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "feral nostalgia... tore at whatever membrane," embodying contradictory jealousy and drive to order; final sleep micro-choice earns endurance with mortality cost, rooted in chronicler traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via dream density building to CR closure; orientation anchors in opening grave/cabin setup; cost legible in final "air would hold them" vs. grave patience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Birch bark "shed skin" and cabin wind "shushing a child" constrain isolation and charge final image; sensory hierarchy reflects ranger POV, mirroring jaded internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to distill chaos signaled early, deepens texturally via soaring jealousy tightening to sleep pursuit; agency in breathing pattern forecloses waking stasis with felt jaded cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to chaos/mortality via alive dream selves, reweighting feral nostalgia without moral; emerges organically from bark-granite parallels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "made of nothing heavier than want"; diction/rhythm modulates from reflective to charged poise, no slippage under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels via "jaded wonder" phrasing; metaphors consistent, no figurative muddle in peak dream transcription.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh feral nostalgia transforms grave trope into predatory force driving dream tactics; closure's dream-grave synthesis feels inevitable, bold reflective risk heightens stakes.</comment>
