<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete noticing (e.g., "old words fell from mouths like loose teeth"); contradictory impulses in noticing vs. preventing culminate in earned decision to uncloak, with visible cost of risking erasure. Final choice reveals hierarchy of values, foreclosing secrecy path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of observation tighten to Charged Poise closure in final decision ("She would uncloak it"), reconfiguring secrecy with legible risk cost; orientation anchored early via Velen Street and courtyard arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard (jasmine, figs, wisteria) constrains secrecy and enables reclamation, charging final image ("mint was still growing between the stones"); sensory details (chamomile scent, bread crust) selective via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (absolution via preservation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through bread-eating beat to agency in uncloak decision; cost of exposure forecloses isolation, reweighting options under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinary emerges implicitly from particulars (bread score marks, redirected vines); final image ("mint was still growing... that was absolution enough") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting noticing as prayer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (slow disappearances, sacred gestures); rhythmic prose modulates reflective to decisive, perceptual bias consistent in gentle noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short declarative sentences in decision beat); no loops or artifacts, purposeful telling in reflections anchors present micro-choices like bread tearing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality into gentle resistance via tea house; uncloak turn inevitable from established noticing pattern, bold lyric risk heightens quiet stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
