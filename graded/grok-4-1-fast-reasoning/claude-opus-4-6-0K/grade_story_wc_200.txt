<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Modestly fearless trait acts in scene via descent into known hurt and ache pursuit; closure endurance earned by prior micro-choices like frequency hold, with perpetual journey cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds confession density to Elara's thin voice then gorge chord as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "walks on toward the next gorge" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gorge acoustics constrain harp tactics by bending echoes inward; sunrise light finally striking wet walls charges closure chord as environmental payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving Elara's laughter signaled early tightens via distorted harmonics stirring voices to ache integration; agency in note adjustment forecloses erasure path with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final astonished laugh reweights guilt-laughter premise non-literally, emergent from confession particulars without moralizing; invites ambiguity on perpetual healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "air tasted of remorse" and mispronounced notes; rhythmic modulation sustains lyric pressure to closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied syntax; no loops, purposeful metaphors like "dying man holds breath" enhance textural lens without muddling peak chord.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misaligned harp harmonics producing uncorrectable frequencies transforms confession trope organically; lyric risk in echo chord heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
