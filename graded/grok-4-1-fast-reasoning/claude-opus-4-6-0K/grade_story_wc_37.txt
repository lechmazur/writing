<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered memories create embodied contradiction—mind frays but hands/throat remember—driving micro-choices like palm-pressing and swaddling; final memory-rush renunciation (forgetting tomorrow) earns closure with cost scaled perfectly to her flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: song emergence deepens density from stuttered moss to village contagion; RR closure ("freedom into... realms require tending") lands with conceptual cost of perpetual forgetting, on-page in dawn unspooling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica window and silver-barked trees constrain choices (dew soak, sound refraction) and charge final blaze; sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent pulses narrowing to dawn-child glow) mirrors urgency without catalog; micro-setting (roots, linen) tethers action holistically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via dawn-child) signaled early tightens accumulatively through song contagion narrowing to dawn-child stirring; agency in swaddling/whisper forecloses shadow-fruit path with felt cost of temporary memories charging end image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of body-held songs reknitting communal dawn emerges via mycelium image and village beats, reweighting forgetting as grace; final "stubborn, scattered grace of forgetting everything except how to begin" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light as parchment, throat-hid melody); rhythmic diction modulates from frayed texture to blazing release; purposeful compression teaches lyric pattern paid in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short whispers amid long images); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (twilight fruit to woven dawn); peak song-beat accelerates cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirror-world premise transforms memory tropes via body-contagion songs and dawn-weaving; bold lyric risk (village shards as invisible mycelium) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at child-lift closure.</comment>
