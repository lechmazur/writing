<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Vael's hesitation to confess the mark despite wanting to be found; final grafting earned by prior micro-choices like showing the braiding method. Korin's tenderness to the grandmother figure reveals his wound, forcing her bold sympathy into action. Flawless embodiment avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo sculpting to communal webs, closure as Charged Poise in final reed-in-hand image reconfiguring ache with felt emotional cost ("It changed. It became..."). Orientation anchored by orchard/crater in opening paragraph; pattern taught early via figures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian arbor constrains choices (guides fingers, warmth shifts at Korin's arrival) and charges closure (fills with reed people). Crater marsh supplies reeds tactilely integrated into action; POV bias filters spectrums as chest-hurting. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under gathering pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early via invented family; accumulative tightening in Korin's arrival and others gathering narrows isolation options, agency in Vael's showing/teaching forecloses solitude with ache's reconfiguration cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinship webs emerge from reed interlocks and communal sculpting, final image ("reed in hand, waiting to be woven") non-literally answers isolation via created space. Subtext in silence after Korin's wound-sharing; ambiguity lingers in ache's persistence without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (light "hurt the chest," arbor's "slow breath"); rhythmic control modulates from solitary ache to communal brightness. Dialogue subtextual ("Tolerance is not kinship"), goal-driven; stable close third-person limited, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "reed into rib cage, reed into reaching hand" advances craft/character/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (spectrums, molten gold) without muddle in peak communal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reed-kinship in crystalline crater transforms belonging trope via street-art hook; arbor/reeds constrain uniquely, risk in accumulative quiet closure heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from mark's trail to webs.</comment>
