<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ren's meekness and determination contradict in sacrificial barter ("cost her history and livelihood") and shaft descents, earning final rock-picking endurance with visible cost of lost tools.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to first arch's hum ("threads of blue light"), delivering Charged Poise closure as Ren commits sans tools, cost felt in "no hammer now, no silver ring"; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches and shafts constrain descents ("rubble shifted beneath her boots"), charging final "blue stone against blue atmosphere" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to mend resonance tightens accumulatively via barter loss and first stabilization, forcing endurance with "forty-seven more arches" cost reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sacrifice-as-awakening emerges organically; final "Azure defiance" reconfigures prior barters and work without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias ("vibration that tasted of copper and rain"); brief dialogue distinct and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful figures like "roots clutched... desperate fingers" propel without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological life, resonance silk, and meek planetary mender; risk in quiet commitment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
