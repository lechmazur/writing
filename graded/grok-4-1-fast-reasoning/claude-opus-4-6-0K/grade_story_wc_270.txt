<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maret's motivation to evolve tradition intensifies through plant-guided discoveries, culminating in her bold seizure of the amber; contradictory impulses shine in her calm reading amid crowd murmurs, earning the closure choice with communal reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant whispers and kite decoding build density to ceremony climax; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page when amber dissolves into shared threads, reweighting destiny with Conclave power loss legible in priest's startle and lily song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain ritual choice and charge final image of spiraling threads through connected pools; selective sensory details (steam veil, mineral pools, geothermal warmth) mirror internal insurgency via crystal veins/cracked stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition vs. imposition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through decoding revelation; agency peaks in Maret's script-reading and amber-lowering, foreclosing Conclave path with on-page communal gasp and branching futures cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of honest tradition as seed emerges organically from particulars like fern thought and amber dissolution; final image of "futures branching like root systems" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in plant/mineral-inflected noticing (e.g., "slow, mineral-rich sentences"); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to heighten ceremony tension without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from reflective dawn to steam-veiled climax; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (mycelium nutrients, root systems), charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, root-language kite, and communal unseal transforms destiny trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes via lichen precision constraining revelation timing.</comment>
