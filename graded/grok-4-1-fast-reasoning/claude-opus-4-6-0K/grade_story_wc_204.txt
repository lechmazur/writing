<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to decisive action in transcribing and speaking the pattern; embodied noticing of rustle reveals particular competence balanced by the risk of destabilizing her tended stability. Sable's cryptic traits drive the stake without on-page contradiction. Minor slip: limited simultaneous impulses during climax speak-aloud beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns densify over mornings to stutter loops at "She spoke it aloud," landing Charged Poise RR with thaw cost legible in cracking glass and stirring clouds. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of ephemeral frost shapes payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frost as micro-setting constrains transcription choices and charges final melting pane emergence; glass veining and cloud sea evolve causally with rupture, mirroring internal thaw. Sensory hierarchy (whispers, shivering pages) reflects Maren's archival priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release Sable by destabilizing stasis) signaled early in bottled whisper, tightens via accumulating patterns under Accumulative lens to foreclose perfect-loop option with imperfection cost at "Cracks threaded through the flawless geometries." Protagonist agency in speaking drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of contradiction-rich imperfection emerges implicitly from rustle-to-thaw arc, reweighted non-literally in final cloud-breath image without moralizing. Sable's line "One moment... needed to be" resonates as CR without thesis articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in crystalline metaphors ("shelves grew upward like crystalline trees") biases toward archival ephemera; rhythmic compression heightens dawn waits. Stable third-limited POV; sparse dialogue natural and goal-pursuing in Sable's emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost bloomed in elaborate patterns" advances plot/atmosphere); zero loops, coherent metaphors (bottle-smoke voice), varied syntax propels to bell-ring climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress prophecy in frost exploits post-Dissolution negotiability for non-obvious rupture; risk-taking in typographic imperfection as spell transforms stasis trope organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
