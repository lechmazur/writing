<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (devotion amid loss) act in scene via steeping ritual and photo handling; final covenant regeneration earned by eleven-year endurance with relational cost legible in Elise's roughened voice. Interiority concrete and embodied, flaws (stubborn isolation) complicate without hedging. Voice distinction clear in brief dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ink-steeping images and backstory fragments build to Charged Poise closure ("they began again") reconfiguring covenant with felt cost of lost years. Orientation anchored early (jetty, twilight routine). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains ritual (pilings wrapped in clematis) and charges final image (pale flowers glowing around ledger). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tannin surrender mirrors grief). Details tactile, integrated via Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving small moments/covenant) signaled early, tightens via letter and Elise's arrival forcing regeneration choice; endurance forecloses isolation path with cost (haunted euphoria). Agency in micro-choice to share pen. Coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-justice emerges organically from proximate causes chain and vine regeneration motif, shifting at end without statement; final image ("write down the world before it forgot itself") reweights premise non-literally. Complexity in Elise's wrongness embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Maren-limited POV with perceptual signature (ink darkening as devotion); rhythmic control modulates to compression at reunion. Dialogue subtextual ("You kept going"), goal-driven. No head-hopping, diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short final sentences charge closure); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures despite lyrical density ("dominoes made of breath"). Read-aloud ear perfect, overwriting absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist premise transforms preservation trope via tactile ritual and proximate causes chain; risk in quiet Accumulative closure heightens stakes. Non-obvious regeneration synthesis inevitable from vine/ink particulars.</comment>
