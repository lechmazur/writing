<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of freedom versus duty act through micro-choices like orienting burdens and annual descent; final endurance earned by her woven trap, with cost in "infinite freedom yoked to the knowledge." No unearned epiphanies or labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weaving builds to Charged Poise/CR closure in final paragraph, reweighting freedom as heaviest burden with conceptual cost legible in "she had long ago woven it into the pattern." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bronze walls, starlight, and kerosene constrain choices by enabling burden revelation through precise orientation; grotto's hush and damp alcoves charge final pulsing tapestry image, mirroring internal distribution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent calcification to avert mountain split) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through sustained weaving under dawn pressure; agency in endurance forecloses abandonment with felt cost of rebuilt boundary in closing lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of distributed grief emerges organically from particulars like branching guilt and recursive spirals; final image resonant non-literal answer—"freedom to abandon a necessary thing is the heaviest burden"—reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with fractal perceptual signature in layered imagery like "fractal skeleton emerged"; rhythmic control heightens reverie without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory integration; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "whalebone reverie") taught early avoids muddle, with zero loops or scaffolds even in peak weaving beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaving premise transforms duty myth through recursions nesting grief; bold lyric accumulation risks high texture but pays off in inevitable hindsight closure, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
