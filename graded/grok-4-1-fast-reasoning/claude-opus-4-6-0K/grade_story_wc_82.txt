<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in Severance beat where Maren polishes, folds, and weeps simultaneously, earning endurance with visible cost in endless cycle; archetypal grief phrasing like "sorrow" is minor and untouching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to lantern hanging, delivering Charged Poise closure with perpetual cost legible in "tomorrow she would sleep again"; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass basilica and lattice floor constrain Severance projection and shadow crawl, charging final lantern on jasmine with tactile evolution; sensory hierarchy via lantern-maker bias perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Severance deepens grief stake via activation, forcing renunciation of ending sorrow with tormenting cost in dissolving boundary; one tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trembling crane offers non-literal resonant answer to grief's transformation, reweighting dream-gem/paper motifs organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light that remembers, steam dissolving) modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable close-third POV biasing toward craft under grief's pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels via varied syntax; coherent metaphors like "grief into origami cranes" enhance without muddle, even in peak Severance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Shadow Severance and dream-excavation premise risks bold lyric fantasy, synthesizing into inevitable closure where crane "trembled as if remembering how to breathe."</comment>
