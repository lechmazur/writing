<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's embodied reactions like trembling hand on tile flake reveal contradictory impulses toward understanding versus impermanence; final drawing earned by mandala-building micro-choices under rising hush pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whispers densify to emergent hush; tile flake drop incites interjection, yielding unbidden patterns and CR closure at "language molting" with legible cost in "achingly, terrifyingly full."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispering tiles supply iridescent flake constraining interjection; mist's violet-to-lilac shift and damp wall charge final drawing image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mandala stake signaled early tightens via tile/hearing ("hand trembled") to interjection reversal, crystallizing stance; cost unmistakable in cracking voice and terrifying hush fullness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shapes "that meant 'I'm here' and 'I'm sorry' and 'the ache'" reweight unlearning premise from hollowing erosion to gestural fullness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters via chalk artist's impermanence lens ("rain dissolve," "colorful smears"); rhythmic control heightens hush density without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("tonal residue," "geometric voids that felt like grief"); zero loops, coherent metaphors propel to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sand mandala mapping lost words synthesizes language erosion into gestural emergence; risk of lyric hush payoff feels inevitable from tile flake pivot.</comment>
