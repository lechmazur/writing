<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in embodied silence accumulation drives core choices, like handing the needle despite resistance, earning the hummed exhale. Contradictory impulses act in-scene (pause before sharing), with Elin's pressure revealing relational crucible. Final renunciation of solo burden shows hierarchy of values with visible cost. Minor slip: Elin's instant recognition feels slightly unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot-by-knot density builds to pattern break via sharing, culminating in RR closure (hum reconfigures silence) with cost (tremor on admission). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by para 1. No lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (net's stubborn knots) shapes tactics through finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism columns and starlight constrain voices (scatter into color/light), charging final image where lullaby "rose through the prisms and became light." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Maren notices residue stains, Elin clouds); body/net tactile. Micro-setting (needles/net) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground voices to release silence) signaled early, tightens via Elin's join (halves accumulation), narrowing solo endurance under Accumulative lens. Handing needle shows agency with cost (tremor forecloses isolation). Escalation coherent, one decisive deepening suffices; minor abstractness in "interlaced hush" but dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (shared grief transforms burial to growth) emerges from particulars: net voices disperse between them, final clearing image reweights premise without moral. Subtext in Elin's silence-as-gift; ambiguity lingers in partial release. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (silence as "silt," "lattice") biases details; rhythm modulates from sharp ("needle's tip") to breathy closure. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("let me help"), distinct idioms. No head-hopping; diction controlled under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Figurative language purposeful (light "rivers," "pale rivers of color") taught early, coherent in peak (tremor bends light). Read-aloud natural; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: voice-trapping net/mask restorer absorbing silence into hush transforms tropes organically. Bold Accumulative frame (knots → threads) risks poetic density but heightens stakes. Irreplaceable particulars (drowned syllables in hemp) inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives.</comment>
