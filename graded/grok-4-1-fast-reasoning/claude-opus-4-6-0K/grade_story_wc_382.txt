<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in architectural passion, shown through concrete perceptions like "cracked mortar between the bricks murmured," earning her final acceptance; Mrs. Voss applies pressure via patient guidance. Internal growth from novice to keeper feels particular, with embodied wonder in rooftop scene. Minor flaw: brief backstory summaries slightly abstract traits before full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sugar borrowing accumulates to lessons, rooftop interrogation deepens knowledge, culminating in Charged Poise closure as Elara grips the warm seal, reconfiguring her role with inheritance cost legible in "chain of hands reaching back." Orientation anchors immediately in first line. One tightening via meteor-night intensity suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harwood's facade/cracks constrain Elara's goal throughout, rooftop jasmine/vent units charge final image under meteor light. Sensory details selective via POV (linguistic readings of stone), vivid yet economical. No white-room; spatial choreography clear from apartment to stairs to roof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode building's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through weekly phonemes to rooftop "What is buried?" narrowing to inheritance. Agency in Elara's listening/translation forecloses novice path; cost felt in seal's weight/responsibility. Micro-turn at hesitation adds depth without excess reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths beneath facades emerges organically via building "confessions" and seal's chain, final image reweighting "agreed upon lies" without moralizing—"truth went on murmuring" offers resonant CR. Subtext in Voss's "expecting...for years" implies selection cost. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: buildings "whispered in a dialect," modulating to "hummed with...resonance" at peak. Dialogue subtextual ("You already know"), natural idiom distinguishes Voss's quiet authority. Rhythmic control heightens mystery, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayer (e.g., "flour on her wrists and an expression of mysterious familiarity" advances character/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent (linguistic/architectural). Minor register elevation fits lyrical voice without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dead languages and sentient architecture transforms mentor trope into building-chosen inheritance, inevitable in rooftop handover. Risky lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
