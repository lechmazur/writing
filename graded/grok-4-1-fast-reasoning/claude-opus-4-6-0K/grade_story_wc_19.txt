<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs. openness) act vividly in the inversion beat, with the final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like limiting exposure; doll handling reveals particular flaws without labels. Internal arc ties to thematic shift without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to inversion pattern break, yielding Charged Poise closure in the doll-lit silence with felt cost of endured fear; orientation anchored early in trellis platform.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trellis platforms and cloud ceiling constrain inversion choice while charging final descent image; sensory hush (gilded, sprouting) filters through Maren's silence bias, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence collection vs. enclosure terror) deepens via inversion under accumulative lens, with agency in "let it sprout" foreclosing panic path; cost legible in coiled fear nowhere to build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence varieties emerges organically from collected flavors, answered non-literally by "her own" silence reweighting enclosure motif; no moralizing, ambiguity in mother's descent lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (silence as wine/shades) biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic control modulates from measured sips to inversion compression, stable close third with no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (taffy stretch to sprouting hush); no loops/artifacts, figurative density purposeful in peak inversion without muddle or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence collection and monthly inversion transforms claustrophobia trope; risk in lyric hush textures heightens stakes, inevitable in doll's gold-lit reconfiguration.</comment>
