<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (overwhelm vs. endurance) act vividly in the bloom scene, with Lira's sensitivity embodied through specific scents; final serenity earned by planting and journaling causality. Grandmother's gift roots ambition without stock epiphanies. Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to bloom's pattern break, delivering Charged Poise closure where Lira breathes rot amid orchids, cost felt in endured scream of nerves. Orientation anchored early in climb; one tightening sufficient. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Treetop platforms and scents constrain choices (planting height, olfactory burden) and charge final image of death/orchids/rain. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (nose detects sulfurous whisper). Details tactile, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity amid motion) signaled early, escalates via flower's growth to stench reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in breathing forecloses retreat with visceral cost on-page. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom refuses beauty/decay split, resonant in final non-literal image of Lira serene amid grotesque bloom reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in rot/sweetness lingers. Earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with olfactory perceptual signature (distinguish mints, smell rain); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to stench. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring growth (slow build to wave-like stench); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Figuratives purposeful (hummingbirds stitch air) without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herbalist trope with treetop serenity quest and corpse flower wisdom transforms decay into undercurrent; risk in olfactory overload heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
