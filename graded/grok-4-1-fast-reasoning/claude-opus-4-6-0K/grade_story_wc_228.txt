<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between quay habit and promise act in southbound choice and raw finger-painting; final renunciation of quay earned by mirror crack causality with visible routine cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cave discovery deepens pattern of repetition to epiphany; CR closure via shell-carrying and quay abandonment lands with conceptual cost of foreclosed safety, legible in final return image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cave's shaft-lit pool and mineral walls constrain stumble-entry and charge shell foreground; recurring light shift mirrors internal reconfiguration, filtering through painterly bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to paint truth tightens accumulatively via cave revelation narrowing options from quay replication; agency in entering and painting forecloses old path with opportunity cost felt in non-return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" emerges organically from pool reflection and shell stain, reweighting quay premise in final cave-return image without moralizing; charged reprise avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with painterly perceptual signature ("strokes that felt like confessions," mineral "signature of deep time"); rhythmic modulation heightens revelatory pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "pool reflected the ceiling crack so perfectly that the water seemed to hold the sky" propels via image-rhythm without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cracked mirror as "time is up" catalyst transforms artist-rut trope through coastal cave specificity and shell talisman; fresh conceptual hinge elevates without gimmick.</comment>
