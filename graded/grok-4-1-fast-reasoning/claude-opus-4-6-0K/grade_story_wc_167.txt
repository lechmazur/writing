<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via glass stress fractures and ripple reading; motivation to illuminate mundane earned through embodied ritual choice with endurance cost of unnoticed work. Contradictory impulses in ordinary panes vs. sacred rings act simultaneously, culminating in affirmed covenant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ripple-mist-prism interactions builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where sun's breach reconfigures mundane labor with conceptual cost of imperceptible shift ("world that had shifted, imperceptibly"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards, clean single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay's pond stones and prism atrium constrain communion action and charge final image of emerging colors mirroring inner knowing; sensory details (silver water, noctilucent glow) filtered through glazier bias, evolve causally with dawn lift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of affirming mundane value signaled early via grandmother's teaching; single deepening via fading ripples' geometry tightens to Charged Poise endurance, foreclosing doubt with felt cost of unseen covenants ("nobody would call them beautiful"). Minor slip: stakes internal/subtle, less visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of disruption's precise generosity emerges organically from rings/windows as returning image shifting to covenant realization; final line offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with glazier perceptual signature (reading fractures/lines); rhythmic modulation peaks in ripple dawn density, purposeful compression taught early via pond ritual pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm syncing to dawn cadence; no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in "ghost of geometry" and "noctilucent reckonings" supports closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh glazier-ripples synthesis transforms mundane epiphany trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame inevitable in hindsight via noctilucent private idiom heightening stakes of unnoticed miracles.</comment>
