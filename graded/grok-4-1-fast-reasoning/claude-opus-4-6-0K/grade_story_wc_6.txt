<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion in scar vibration and contradictory impulses (no forgiveness yet planting with father's coin) acting in the planting beat; final humming choice earned by backstory anchors and present micro-choices, revealing values hierarchy with emotional cost of father's death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sand sifting to tree tamping to humming, yielding Charged Poise closure in final image (scar sings over lagoon) with felt cost (father's death un-erased); orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting specifics (black sand grit, kelp fronds syncing breath, dune-shifting lagoon) constrain planting choice at water's margin and charge final image (humming over obsidian water); sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (volcanic coolness, salt gusts) integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via grafting/coin beats narrowing to humming endurance; agency in tamping soil forecloses erasure path with father's death cost legible in "didn't forgive... refusal to let harm be the only story."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unyielding compassion emerges organically from particulars (coin on tree, scar hum); final image offers resonant non-literal answer (scars carry music) reweighting premise, but −0.6 for overt articulation ("That was what unyielding compassion meant") bordering thematic echo in penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (alert to smoke whispers, tissue resonance); rhythmic control modulates from meditative to charged in closing hum, with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in action beats (tamping integrates setting/character); varied rhythm passes ear test, but −0.5 for figurative density (clouds as "magnificent herds," scars "singing" literalized repeatedly) bordering overwrite without pattern payoff in peak reflective close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-daughter firefighter proving "scars sing" literally via grafted tree/coin in obsidian setting; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative lens heightens stakes, with final coin-spin image inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
