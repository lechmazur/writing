<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—ignoring origami then yielding to the pillow lotus—act in scene, compelling her final micro-choice to infuse stencil with brooch/locket, earning renewal with inward-turn cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as image density (origami → stencil pinholes → graphite line) tightens to CR closure; "hand steady for the first time in months" makes emotional cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome and starlight-perforated vellum constrain tracing choice and charge floor-galaxy image, filtering through Elara's grief lens without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant renewal stake deepens accumulatively from observation to vellum pickup and drawing, agency foreclosing avoidance with steady-hand trade-off charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final dead-star image non-literally answers "withering to bloom" by reweighting genuine artificial light, resonating grief transmutation without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (hair/glass to starlight/vellum) with rhythmic modulation; Sable/Elara voices distinguish via "subdued ardor" idiom vs. quiet recognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propulsion peaks in "quiet sound of graphite meeting vellum—a whisper that said, at last, now," with zero loops and varied rhythm charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of grief jewelry, dying stars, and renewal stencil risks lyric payoff, transforming tropes via "genuinely artificial" into inevitable cartography.</comment>
