<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's rationality shines in embodied details like pressing fingers into loam for truffles amid emotional broadcast, with contradictory impulse to share relic despite "silence was the only refuge"; final endurance earned via prior isolation logic. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("psychological safety") nicks without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from forager solitude to woman’s arrival tightening emotional pressure; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in shared shelter moment with legible cost ("sometimes less... learn to build"), reconfiguring interaction options. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hanging orchard's cables and storms constrain movement and occlude presences, mirroring theme; final image charges with wind "like breath through a broken instrument," reweighting partial silence. Sensory hierarchy (fungal logic over faces) biases via Maren’s priorities; no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety signaled early via retreat, deepens accumulatively with woman's desperate hope "making Maren's teeth ache," narrowing to eye's temporary occlusion; agency in sharing forecloses full isolation with felt relational cost in shared silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of consent in truth emerges organically from virus world to eye's partial door-closing; final image offers non-literal resonant answer ("fractured grace... imperfect, and therefore bearable"), reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like glass fractures avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Maren’s perceptual signature (fungi patterns vs. human hum); voice modulates rhythmically, diction biased toward rational science amid lyricism. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("That's enough"), distinguishing voices without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "wind and rain occluded things" advances setting/stakes/theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise verbs/nouns. Final line's image resolves with propulsion, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus + fungal logic + relic transforms post-plague isolation trope; risk in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes via conceptual cost of imperfection. Premise feels inevitable, no derivatives.</comment>
