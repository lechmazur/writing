<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (betrayal/love ache) act in the proffering scene, earning the renunciation of full forgiveness with relational cost; interiority particular via moss/growth metaphors tied to body/memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from icicle pattern to garden to sister encounter, landing Charged Poise RR in pendant proffer with trembling-hand cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned data center's server racks/moss constrain hiding and enable growth tactics, charging "green cathedral" final image; sensory details (drips, moss-soft floor) filter through gardener's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (private healing post-exposure) tightens via sister arrival under accumulative lens, forcing endurance/proffer that forecloses isolation with vulnerability cost; agency in micro-choice peaks coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final pendant image resonantly reconfigures "wounds as channels" theme without statement, emerging from garden particulars; ambiguity lingers in "not forgiveness, not yet."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (light/moss patterns); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to encounter pressure, diction biased toward natural growth textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor metaphor density in reflective beats ("splinters," "arterial") purposeful without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession ruin-to-garden transforms betrayal trope; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable icicle/moss logic to closure.</comment>
