<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "discarding assumptions," showing contradictory impulses acting in the tuning beat; final tears earn change via life-spent motivation without safety-hedging. Minor expository belief summary early does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density thins static to "shard of hush," pattern interlocks for RR/Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "tears on her face" as waveform completes, reconfiguring city from abandoned to paused. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via groaning stairs and intact array, charges final image with swaying bridges in "deliberate" wind mirroring unlocked frequency. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (oxidized copper, chest pressure); no white-room, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock signal) tightens via textural deepening—"static thinned"—forcing agency shift to discard assumptions; cost unmistakable in tears and foreclosed "endings" view, charging poise under lens. One decisive cadence sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (endings as pauses) emerges organically from hush+fragment interlocking, final "pressed play" reweights premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in city/gorge tuning to frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in signal metaphors ("bent wavefronts," "coherent nothing"); rhythmic control modulates to serene intensity, diction purposeful without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "frequency below hearing that pressed against her chest"); rhythm varies read-aloud, metaphors coherent and propel (static wall thins); no scaffold in peak hush beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystallized broadcasts and sub-audible signals transforms sci-fan tropes via "fantasy practicality"; risk in hush-as-presence inevitable in hindsight, heightens conceptual stakes cleanly.</comment>
