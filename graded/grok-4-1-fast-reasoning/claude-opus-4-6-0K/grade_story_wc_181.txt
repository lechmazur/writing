<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like whispering to the cameo in the outhouse, earn the final tending with embodied trembling and curator-specific renunciation of possession. Minor early passivity in bewilderment fades without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations density-build to CR closure: knowledge pour reweights time perception with cost in "Don't. Tend it," crystallized when she hangs the cameo and prunes. Orientation anchored early in orchard; pattern taught via spirals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Astral orchard and cameo constrain choices, like palm on grandmother-tree and outhouse breakthrough, charging final tending image; sensory details (warm bark, skull fruit) filter through curator bias, vivid yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding inheritance tightens via whisper-agency to knowledge-deepening, narrowing to tend-vs-possess under Accum lens; cost legible in foreclosed keeping, felt in hanging cameo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear time and preserve-without-possess emerge organically from orchard-library images; final "love wearing its most complicated face" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (trees as legible sentences); rhythmic texture modulates from bewilderment to luminous disquiet, elisions (e.g., airless breathing) taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; figurative layering ("geological strata") purposeful in breakthrough beat, no artifacts dulling closure image of canopy light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pistachio-skulls, time-spirals, bathroom-epiphanies transforms inheritance trope; bold nonlinear frame commits fully, risk heightens stakes in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
