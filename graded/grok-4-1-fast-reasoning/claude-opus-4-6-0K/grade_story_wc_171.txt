<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in Maren's "operatively gentle" precision amid trembling hand and backstory costs, earning the closure endurance; contradictory impulses act in her careful speech forcing signs. Flaws like nerve damage complicate without hedging, driving micro-choices. Backstory anchors tilt present via Kessith bombing cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent to moons' hum sealing oath as Charged Poise RR with legible cost in shaking hands descent. Orientation anchors by para 2; one tightening via conjunction forces sign-now. No lens ambiguity; closure cost undeniable in "hands were shaking... loneliness rushed back."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurrent terrace stone and moons constrain ascent, ritual, descent, charging final image; midsummer light "like honey" mirrors flawed beauty selectively via Maren's bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to hum in teeth/chest under crisis. Micro-setting (clipboard, altar) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal Accord) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual pressure to conjunction forcing trade-offs; agency in Maren's speech narrows options to "sign or... hate." Cost legible in concessions and post-oath tremble; moral calculus sharpens peak without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peace-as-daily-practice emerges via particulars like nicked clipboard and shaking hands, reweighting redemption in final image without statement. Subtext in silences (no eye contact) and irony of beautiful stains invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from "anchor ideals in practice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to surgeon-gentle details like "grooves worn by... feet"; diction/rhythm modulates to short sentences at hum. Dialogue subtext-laden ("You both know the price"), distinct from narration; no head-hopping, elision taught via moons.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light poured... gilding the cracks" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies for propulsion, zero loops/artifacts. Metaphors consistent (honey/chains) without muddle in peak; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual sci-fi premise via flawed negotiator's personal cost, transforming war tropes through moons' celestial chains; risk in quiet poise ending heightens stakes. No derivative templates; terrace/moons feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
