<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's motivation to preserve wonder roots deeply in traits like seasonal muteness and bell-tuning, culminating in earned endurance via the sculpture's success; interiority shines in "silence had once felt like a wound. Now... a door left open," revealing contradictory impulses without epiphany clichés. Final watch from doorway feels character-particular, foreclosing isolation with relational cost to lowlanders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from backstory shards to present visitors, tightening via unpredictable harmonies and ice-light; closure as Charged Poise in "the light moved, and the world... glistened," reconfiguring impermanence with sublimation cost legible in "iceberg fragment... slowly sublimating." Orientation anchors early (bluff, autumn muteness); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bluff's wind-driven clouds and granite constrain sculpture mechanics, charging closure via rotating planes and ice-lens blue scatter; sensory hierarchy (sounds carried upward, cold-burn ice) filters through Orin's tuner bias. Final image evolution ties weather to thematic pulse without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, escalates texturally via visitor reactions ("boy reached toward the scattered blue") forcing Orin's stance crystallization; one deepening reweights via sculpture's honest resonance over language loss. Agency in building/endurance coheres under Accumulative lens, cost felt in transient ice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's vessel emerges via particulars (bells tuned to "frequency... before it faded"), resonant CR in glistening world answering language's thinning; subtext in silences' architecture avoids moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question, ambiguity lingers in impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("clouds drifted below like slow herds"), rhythmic control modulates reflective calm to final pulse; POV stable single-focal, no elision opacity. Syntax reflects tuner's precision without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "tuning... until it rang not with perfection but with honesty" advances craft/theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("clouds... like a sea that had forgotten its shore"). Closure image unmarred, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world with bell symphonies transforms wonder trope via ice-lens physics; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes of transience, inevitable in hindsight from early tuning truths. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
