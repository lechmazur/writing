<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory dreamlessness enables "charm it" micro-choice as container for signal, earning closure endurance with thalamus scar cost visibly weighted against rejoined archive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to clock tick at "12:01," reconfiguring divergence with dream sacrifice as felt conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dune flowers' violet light on hands and pulsing bright during signal constrain kneeling/recording, charging faded closure image with root defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Signal's body-wide pressure forces charming agency, tightening stake with coherence payoff and permanent dreamlessness as undeniable trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "wholeness... repeated nightly" reweights dream sacrifice as practice, emerging from signal fractures without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Freight-guard perceptual signature in "whispered... firmly, without tenderness" holds under signal stress, rhythmic control intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere, the wave function refusing locality" delivers high density without muddle, propulsion peaks at clock tick.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum archive superposition via dune signal synthesizes fresh inevitability, transforming guard's sacrifice into resonant practice.</comment>
