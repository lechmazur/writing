<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("softening behind her sternum, the way ice thins"); motivation intensifies via memory cue to relic pursuit, earning final healing with cost of past concealment. Micro-choices like camera setup reveal values under spiritual pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("grief was not grief") borders therapy-speak but stays anchored in breath and image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to breathing revelation to print image as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting stored love with cost of centuries' wait legible in "small bright circle, almost a teardrop." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (viaduct, Maren, camera). Single scene, no shards; closure intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct's crumbling path and thickest wisteria constrain camera midpoint choice; twilight moisture and scent filter through POV urgency, mirroring internal fog. Recurring blossoms invert as "lavender flames" to charge final print. Sensory hierarchy selective (scent, light scatter); no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve buried love via relic/camera) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory → breathing → anomalous image, narrowing to acceptance with felt cost ("rusted hinges," foreclosed tenderness). Agency in pilgrimage and exposure; internal pressure coheres without reversal overload. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stored unused love emerges via particulars (clay burial, jade relic, pinhole print); final image reconfigures premise non-literally ("pooled into a shape... breathing") without moralizing. Resonance from image shifts, not platitudes; counter-reading (belief skepticism) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature ("fog lit from within," "photon... small fire"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in breathing beat. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Diction biased to artist's eye (inversions, exposures).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Twilight pooled... seemed to breathe"); rhythm varies (short breath sentences peak); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figuratives integrate (wisteria "draped... spine"). Zero artifacts in closure print beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pinhole honesty, past-life calcified love, relic tear into anomalous print revelation; transforms spiritual tropes via artist's tech (inverted alcove yields teardrop). Risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure charge without gimmick.</comment>
