<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's micro-choices under intuitive pressure—hauling skiff, decoding slide, carving frame—reveal consistent traits and earn worldview shift with cost of solitude foreclosed; interiority concrete and embodied, though reflective harmony slightly mutes contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from GPS failure to slide decoding to carving, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure ("not alone in time") with undeniable conceptual cost in final niche placement; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archway's hum, basalt niche, and tide constrain choices (hauling, carving, sheltering) and charge final image of constellations on walls; sensory details (spray, turbine drone) selective via POV bias, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (instrument-less navigation/knowledge relay) signaled early, tightens via slide's deepening (map realization narrows to time-alliance imperative); agency in carving forecloses solitary-art path with legible cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of simplicity scaffolding complexity emerges organically via slide's layers and Maren's frame; final image non-literally answers initial isolation with resonant CR ("hands she would never touch"), reweighting prior realizations without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (sea moods, wood speech); rhythmic prose modulates reverie to charged poise at carving, purposeful compression legible under taught accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "tide rose around her ankles" advances setting/action/emotion); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure image, though minor figurative density in reflections nears overwrite threshold without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of layered slide as nav-art relay transforms tropes of lost sailor/epiphany into fresh timewoven network; carving frame's inevitability from particulars risks bold lyric closure without gimmickry.</comment>
