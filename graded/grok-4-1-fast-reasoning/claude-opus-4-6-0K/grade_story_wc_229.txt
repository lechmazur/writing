<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in "throat ache" from scent and micro-choice of pressing cork into palm; contradictory impulses act as she persists despite Bertram's looming dismissal; final smile and "Listening" earn stasis with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from scent release to trawler adjustment as CR, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of quiet conviction; orientation anchors instantly in lighthouse/heat wave; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt tower and garden vials constrain vial-to-breeze action and charge final trawler image; sensory focus on scents reflects Lira's bias, evolving with dawn; spatial choreography tracks flawlessly from stairs to gallery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers > shouts) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via logbook/vial progression narrowing to Bertram confrontation; agency in scent release forecloses shout path with felt mockery cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from scent-as-whisper particulars, final "width of a whisper" reconfigures non-literally with ambiguity (imagined vs. real); subtext layers in Bertram contrast without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "vibrations of intent" diction biases toward scents; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation; dialogue sparse but subtext-rich in Lira's soft "Listening."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "fragrance uncurled... intimacy that made her throat ache"; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors; zero scaffolds, precise causation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scent-as-signal transforms lighthouse trope via vibrations premise; bold accumulative lyricism risks gimmick but heightens stakes inevitably; fresh synthesis feels organic to Lira's worldview.</comment>
