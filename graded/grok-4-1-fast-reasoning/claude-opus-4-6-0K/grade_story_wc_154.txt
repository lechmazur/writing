<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority peaks concretely in "throat closed" and thumb over "stay," embodying contradictory fear of failing language yet compelled endurance; motivation roots in translator traits, earning final renunciation of flight with coral-cast union as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, decryption beats densify pattern of memory/language to Charged Poise closure; "Tell Lena: stay" reconfigures anchor role with felt emotional cost in final stillness, lens holds cleanly from midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atrium's "glass ceiling wept condensation" mirrors internal ache, constraining decryption via fading light; coral as micro-setting charges closure image, filtering through translator's perceptual bias on grooves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode plea to affirm bond) deepens accumulatively through multilingual lines to "I AM NOT THE WAVE," forcing endurance choice; cost legible in foreclosed isolation, agency in placing coral atop cast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting meaning emerges implicitly via cast decryption paralleling coral, reweighting shared anxiety in final image without statement; resonance from particulars avoids tidy moral, invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with translator's perceptual signature (grooves/ labyrinths); rhythmic control heightens density in peak decryption, diction biased toward decoding bias without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in "grafting new meaning onto old wounds"; minor figurative density in reflections doesn't muddle closure image of reef on plaster.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh Pacific translator-child bond via cast cryptography transforms healing trope; risk of lyric stasis pays off in charged final image, inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
