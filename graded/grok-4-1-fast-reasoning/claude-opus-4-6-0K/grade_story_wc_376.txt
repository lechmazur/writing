<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in pursuit of completion versus affliction's truth-detection act in scene; final inscription choice earned by prior causality with embodied cost in steady hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure ("fragment mattered more"); cost legible in empty jar and acceptance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vault jars and afflicted body constrain search and charge final inscription; calligrapher's perceptual filter (inks, pigments) integrates setting purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of recovering mother's words tightens accumulatively via warden lie and incomplete whisper; agency in seal-breaking forecloses completion with emotional cost felt on floor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ending image of "gilding the silence" offers resonant non-literal answer to words' impermanence, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with calligraphic perceptual signature; rhythmic diction modulates from humid corridors to whisper-thin revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied syntax, peaking in vault ("cathedral of glass jars") with flawless figurative control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of linguistic botany and post-toxicity archiving feels inevitable; quiet CR risks abstract closure heightening conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
