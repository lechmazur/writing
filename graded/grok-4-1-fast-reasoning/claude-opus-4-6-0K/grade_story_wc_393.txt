<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Father Tomás's witness role and Elda's arthritic precision earn the final commitment, with relationships pressuring her micro-choice to repair. Elda's hesitation ("Second opinions aren't always about expertise") reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene. Chaplain remains somewhat passive, but motivation coheres without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: delivery cues reveal heart's music box, building to Charged Poise closure as lullaby plays with Elda's whispered vow. Orientation anchors instantly in shop entry. No slips; cost legible in her knuckles-to-lips reaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shop's humming mechanisms and dust-filmed windows constrain repair, with light blades charging the heart's reveal and final blaze. Sensory hierarchy (visual fractures, audible hush) reflects Elda's priorities. Recurring light-through-clouds mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair as action-apology) signaled early tightens accumulatively to Elda's vise-clamping choice, foreclosing specialist option with emotional cost. Pressure coheres via dialogue deepening her fear. Agency peaks in repair; cost felt in closed eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair-as-forgiveness emerges organically from heart's mechanism and Elda's inherited skill, reweighting apology via lullaby without moralizing. Final image answers "words aren't enough" through crystallized commitment. Subtext in untouched heart and loupe stare lingers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Tomás's light-fixated perception) with clean focalization; dialogue subtextual ("I know what he wants") advances goals. Rhythmic prose modulates from hushed chorus to blazing gold. Perceptual signature biases toward sacred mechanisms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: "light came in fractured bands" does image, tone, momentum. Varied rhythm accelerates to "began to wind," no loops or muddled metaphors. Ear-test passes; propulsion peaks clean at closure blaze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clockwork heart transforms prison-redemption trope into mechanical metaphor, with chaplain-as-witness fresh angle. Light-storm interplay risks bold lyricism heightening stakes. No derivative echoes; synthesis inevitable via Suárez lineage.</comment>
