<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between fury and love act simultaneously in picking the angriest letter; final choice to send earned by shard's channeled messages confronting her silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (spirits' hum, moonlight, condensation words) tightens to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "choosing to be the one who broke first" as labyrinth opens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of swamp spirits channeling sister via gargoyle condensation transforms medium trope; risk in magical realism heights closure without gimmickry.</comment>
