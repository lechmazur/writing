<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Insomniac trait embodied concretely in unclosed eyes and trembling hands, driving micro-choices like precise timing and brooch offering; contradictory exhaustion and electric awe act simultaneously at amphitheater center, earning wakefulness reframing as vigil with forfeiture cost of brooch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via rain trails to convergence discovery, pattern tightens in offering/painting under tide pressure, Charged Poise closure in final breathing reconfigures insomnia with legible exhaustion cost—"She would not sleep tonight either. But for the first time... vigil."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal causeway and rain channels constrain timing/paths precisely, charging final image where tide erases footprints; selective sensory hierarchy (salt-cracked stone, darkening moisture) mirrors painterly pattern-seeking, with brooch as micro-setting reweighting epochs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) signaled early via insomnia/patterns, escalates accumulatively to offering amid wreckage that forces renunciation; tide deadline tightens with felt cost (incomplete painting, brooch gone), though single deepening lacks micro-turn agency spike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Convergence theme emerges organically from war wreckage and brooch amid channels "like veins toward a heart," reweighting preservation across epochs; final painting hold offers non-literal answer to insomnia's burden, resonating without moralizing via haggard awe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern-tracing ("translating... into pigment"); rhythmic modulation peaks in loose brushwork desperation, diction biased toward painterly convergence without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "She painted until the light changed, which happened fast"—varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with tide urgency; no loops, metaphors cohere (island as "bruise," brooch "second heartbeat"), clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal memorial and insomnia-as-vision transforms survival tropes via brooch's prehistoric insect amid rusted processors; risk in lyric accumulation heightens pattern stakes, inevitable at "painting... wryly earnest, like... herself."</comment>
