<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied via tapping ritual revealing hierarchy of values (data vs. human why); contradictory impulses between hydraulic knowledge and sought human explanation act in scene, earning final endurance with felt cost in "tethered to a wound."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from data assembly to anomaly row, culminating in CR closure ("The paths didn't drown. They were pulled down.") with conceptual cost of undermined reality reweighting premise; orientation anchored early, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station 11, tide gauge, and pilings constrain data work and charge final image ("pilings shudder faintly with the tide"); sensory hierarchy (percussive taps, thermal memory) mirrors priorities without catalog; body/tool as micro-setting enables tapping payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand paths' disappearance) signaled early, tightens via anomaly deepening that narrows to reef-collapse realization under Accumulative lens; agency in stitching data forecloses "drown" assumption with cost legible in moored drifting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of delayed consequence emerges organically from particulars (stored heat, collapsed reefs), final image ("sea... assembling its case") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting ban's false halt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (scientific rhythms, tidal percussion); rhythmic control modulates from ritual grounding to charged poise under stress; purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "stitched numbers the way archaeologists stitch pottery"); zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("oceans held memory... like old wood"); varied rhythm accelerates to eternal cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data anomaly revealing "pulled down" paths transforms climate trope via lived scientist's lens; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from atlas-data convergence.</comment>
