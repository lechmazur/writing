<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Fen's duty vs. dawning understanding peak in her choice to file the claim, earned by Maren's tuning fork revelation and ribbon-tied backstory; Maren's persistence shows through micro-choices like descending to engage. Voice distinction shines in dialogue rhythms. No safety-hedging; flaws (Fen's youth, Maren's attachment) drive the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: eviction pressure coheres to Fen's DC (filing claim) with cost (Compact fury); tuning fork beat causally reveals stakes, tightening options on-page. Single scene, anchored early ("climbed the scaffolding," "nave"). Closure reconfigures before/after legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral-rafter orchard constrains choices (trees hold roof) and charges final blossoms/ribbon image; quartz-eye filters perception via "spectrums only she could read." Sensory hierarchy (fog, clicking lens, resonant tone) biases via Maren's expertise, mirroring persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eviction vs. structural dependency) signaled early, tightens via tuning fork reversal forcing Fen's stance crystallization under situational lens; agency in Maren's descent/bag use, Fen's ledger act pays visible cost (fury forewarned).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistence over "deciduous" contracts emerges via twig catch → tuning fork → ledger, with ribbon reprise reweighting generational gap non-literally; final blossoms offer resonant answer to "tree remains," embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature ("fracture lines like scripture") biases noticing; dialogue subtext-laden ("persisting" vs. "trespassing"), distinct idiolects (Maren's metaphors vs. Fen's legalism). Rhythm modulates with blossoms cascade under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: "roots clutched... arthritic fingers" purposeful, no muddle; syntax varies for propulsion (short post-fork sentences build shiver). Zero loops; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vertical orchard premise ingeniously fuses anomaly with salvation, transformed via mender's lens and tuning fork; risk in quiet ledger closure heightens stakes organically, no tropes unearned.</comment>
