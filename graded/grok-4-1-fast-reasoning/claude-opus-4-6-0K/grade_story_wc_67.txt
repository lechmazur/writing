<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses to preserve via ritual while staging disappearance act in scene; final realization earned by ash-scattering pattern and chair's halt, with embodied cost in powdered portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via image density from corridors to chair's diminishing arcs; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "she had preserved the disappearing," reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Narrowing corridors constrain approach to mother's portrait and charge final image; chair's creak and porcelain's "small bright wounds" provide tactile, POV-specific anchors mirroring internal vanishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crystallizing safety's mirage deepens accumulatively through guest reactions and corridor walk; agency in powdering forces stance shift with felt emotional cost at chair's stop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Safety as mirage emerges from particulars like incomplete mask and distant portrait; final image of holding mask reconfigures theme with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ash/charcoal noticing and convergence motifs; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in closing silence, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job images like "porcelain caught the overhead light and threw small bright wounds"; varied rhythm propels without loops or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kintsugi mask and vanishing gallery synthesize fresh angle on grief/preservation; structural risk in perspective convergence heightens stakes organically to inevitable close.</comment>
