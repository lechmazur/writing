<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to seed innovation roots consistently in traits like patient attention, shown in nib hover and mental model run; interiority concrete via "future pressing against the membrane"; competent smoothness lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, denying 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as conceptual density tightens to Charged Poise closure in "spire hummed faintly... soon would," with cost legible in "patient discipline of attention"; orientation anchored early (spire, lake, study); no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain ascent and charge final hum/resonance image; sensory hierarchy (iron-cold air, dawn light) reflects cartographer's perceptual bias; details tactile and evolving (lake mirrors frost to light), mirroring internal poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (birth new science via convergence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through model run tightening options; agency in sustained attention forecloses arbitrary writing with felt cost of precision; lacks live trade-off in final beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emergence over rebellion arises organically from particulars like nib hover and convergence chart, resonant in final image reweighting "inevitable rather than arbitrary"; no moralizing, ambiguity in "yet soon would" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mapper of "unanswered questions," "architecture of what could be") biases noticing; elevated diction/rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences at hover); stable close-third POV, no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "nib had never touched ink. That was the point"); purposeful figurative layering taught early pays off at closure; minor register elevation in peak ("charged silence") borders drift but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ignorance-mapping and crystalline resonance transforms predictive trope via grounded imagination; risk in lyric poise heightens conceptual stakes; no derivatives, premise commits fully to constraint-emergence logic.</comment>
