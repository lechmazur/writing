<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via architect's perceptual lens on illusions/memories; motivation intensifies through weaving micro-choices to compelled completion. Contradictory impulses in "truer" memories surfacing under calm drive earn final endurance. No unearned epiphanies; change in web's pulse carries embodied cost to fingertips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from weaving to web-spanning completion. Closure as Charged Poise in "She tied the final knot. The thread vibrated once... carrying something warm," reconfiguring gallery/meaning with felt cost. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via brass hooks/Penrose tiling guiding thread paths; POV filters through designer's familiarity. Sensory selection purposeful (humming threads, breathing floors). Final walls shifting charges image; body/hands as micro-setting in knot-tying.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (web for connection) signaled early; tightening via near-completion forces final knot under lens. Internal pressure coheres through memory alterations narrowing to calm crystallization. Cost legible in pulse's return/warmth, though subtle for 9+ agency drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shaped connection emerges via web/illusions brushing consciousness; final strangers' "not alone" reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars (sinew hum, memory faces) avoids morals. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "rational enchantment" lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with architect's perceptual signature (geometric delusions, thread physics). Rhythmic modulation builds to peak calm; diction precise/purposeful. No elision issues; voice distinct in syntax reflecting fevered precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies naturally, propulsion via image integration. Peak knot beat clean, no figurative muddle. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architecture/enchantment via sinew web transforms illusion tropes organically. Risk in "realistically imaginary" geometry heightens stakes to inevitable close. No derivatives; particular details (Montana bowyer, hospital bedsheets) anchor vision.</comment>
