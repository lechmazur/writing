<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in "her body becoming the instrument," revealing motivation through precise actions under pressure; change from refusal to release feels earned. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong; no blind spots force mistakes, but endurance carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds thread-by-thread to Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("sigh that became... a smile of light") with legible bodily cost ("light fading from her fingertips"). Single scene, orientation anchored early ("silver courtyard under snow"); no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism and snow constrain choices ("cold bit into her skin"; "press her entire body") and charge final image ("snow covered her footprints, but the echoes... traveled ahead"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (light threads as voices); purposeful selection mirrors release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release echoes vs. doctrine) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thickening threads forcing full-body press; agency in patient untangling forecloses compliance path. Cost felt in physical strain at climax; one tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silenced voices emerging organically via heard echoes ("mother's unfinished warning"); final image ("seeds carried on a wind that smelled of thaw") reweights refusal-to-release without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with poetic perceptual signature ("each gesture a line break"); rhythmic modulation builds pressure (short sentences at climax). Lyrical compression taught early, legible under Accum lens; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("Thread by thread, the voices separated"); purposeful figurative pattern (poetic body) coherent without muddle. Minor overwriting in untangling beat (stacked metaphors like "dancing with the light") dings propulsion slightly, but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh harmonic-lock premise with echoes as fermented truths transforms courtesan trope; bold lyric risk (body-as-poem) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable synthesis: grandmother's laughter seeds personal defiance payoff.</comment>
