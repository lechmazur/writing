<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied janitor poise shines in "unhurried, unselfconscious, attentive to the task" during play; contradictory urge to sweep vs. violin pull acts in scene; acceptance earned via ghost amalgamation with melting cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via loop density to violin shiver; closure as RR in "loop did not reset" with melting cost legible in final sweep; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard freeze births violin constraining grip and play; melting water charges final drain sweep; sensory hierarchy janitor-specific (frost as dust, rime crackle).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake integration via loops tightens accumulatively through ghost density; agency in raw play forces amalgamation; violin melt as unmistakable price forecloses origin quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "question hummed on, no longer a wound but a hymn" reweights premise non-literally; mundane mysticism emerges from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "quiet and domestic, like the urge to straighten a crooked frame"; rhythmic control peaks in note descriptions; stable close third under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "notes amalgamated them... dust settles back onto a shelf"; varied rhythm propels to "ordinary and frozen and done."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice violin from fountain transforms loop trope ingeniously; janitor calm risks mundane closure that heightens stakes via charged poise.</comment>
