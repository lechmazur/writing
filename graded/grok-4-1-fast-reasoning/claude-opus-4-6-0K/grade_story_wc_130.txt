<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer's inventive trait concretely shown in dovetailing "jagged edge of one measurement into the notch of another"; internal conflict of grief/hope embodied in ritual endurance with no tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of variables/images builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: "equation refined itself... converges on a practice"; cost legible in "unfinished goodbye" and ongoing uncertainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard's stalactites/moss constrain ritual silence and charge final "roots in limestone" image; sensory details (bioluminescence, copper taste) selectively mirror emotional geology without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve ambiguous loss) signaled early, tightens via one deepening cascade of numbers refining equation; endurance agency forecloses finality with felt cost of perpetual return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's mathematics emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonating in final non-literal image of "optimism... buried deep, like roots" reweighting grief into luminous practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of mathematical lens ("orbital diagrams"); rhythmic control modulates from precise variables to lyrical close without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (veins/orbits/roots) and propel via varied syntax, peaking cleanly in "alive and reaching" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of geology/emotion via mosaic decoding and glass eyes transforms grief trope; cavern orchard premise feels inevitable, risking lyric ritual payoff.</comment>
