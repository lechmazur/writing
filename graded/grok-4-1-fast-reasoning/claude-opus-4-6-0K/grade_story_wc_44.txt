<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via rune-specific perceptions and relearnings; deliberate trait shown in "seventeen notebooks" and "obsessive care" compels progressive choices. Final transformation earned by causal seal openings with conceptual cost of becoming the shadow-place. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps it from perfect 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via seal discoveries to CR closure: "she had become the place they returned to" reweights shadow premise with undeniable cost in seven shadows. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Maren, observatory, post-bending Tuesday). Single scene causality holds cleanly through gear turns and vibrations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating isle, selenite prisms, mineral veins constrain solo work and charge final shadows "unfurling...across the observatory floor." Sensory hierarchy rune-focused (glyphs pulsing, gears turning). No generic placeholders; details evolve with seal activations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow destination) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through four prior seals to final three rapid openings narrowing to self-insertion risk. Agency in closing recursive loops forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in transformation charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of recursive light/shadow loops emerges via particulars (shadow as memory, noon flatness), resonant CR ending reweights without moral: becoming shadow-place shifts paradox to reality. No sermonizing; ambiguity in "dark wings" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third with rune-scholar perceptual bias (glyphs as "living circuits"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in final seals ("gears turned their final rotation"). Lyrical diction controlled, no filter stacks or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (spacetime "curling like soft metal," shadows "wound tight as springs"). Varied syntax propels to peak: final sentence image resolves with propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm perfect under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune puzzles, spoon-bent reality, shadow storage as potential energy; risk in self-referential climax ("key inside its own description") inevitable from priors. Bold premise fully committed without retreat.</comment>
