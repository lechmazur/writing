<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in final reflection on kingdom fracture versus truth, earning the renunciation to carry the rune with embodied cost in small hands closing the book gently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as fragment search density tightens to rune assembly and Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "The collapse, when it came, would be graceful" with cosmic pause reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library's timeless eddies and scattered shelves constrain the search, charging final step "out of the pause" image; ink pellet as micro-setting measures waning progress tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of unmasking deepens via rune realization, forcing endurance with on-page cost of fracturing alliances; final thumb-press and walk-out crystallize agency under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's destructive grace emerges implicitly; final "lantern into a house built of shadows" reweights smallness-from-strength without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in mythic diction ("dust older than language") biases toward cosmic patience; rhythmic control modulates from pooling time to crisp exit propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; figurative layering ("tiny dark moon waning") coherent and pattern-taught early, propelling to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rune scattered in margins transforms impostor trope via lived search; risk in poetic compression heightens "diminutive titan" stakes organically.</comment>
