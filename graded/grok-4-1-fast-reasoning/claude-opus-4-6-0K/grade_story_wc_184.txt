<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like steady finger work on braids amid ticking clock; motivation rooted in archival precision compels restoration with earned endurance. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal restoration beat for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via artifact revelations to CR closure: record made whole reweights absence fable with conceptual cost of rewritten history. Orientation anchored early; door's impossibility causally launches restoration without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clock tower's gears and limestone vividly constrain tactile restoration on stone floor; sensory hierarchy (ticking heartbeat, fragile braids) mirrors methodical priorities. Micro-setting charges final evidence on worktable but doesn't fully pivot choices for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (historical truth vs division) signaled early, deepens via wrong braid pattern narrowing to restoration agency; cost legible in patient reconfiguration foreclosing falsified narrative. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fables of absence emerge organically from particulars (empty shelf, rebraided cord), reweighted non-literally in final presentation merging hidden with known. Resonant CR ending answers foundational unity question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct archival perceptual signature in precise diction ("tight but fragile, their pattern encoding"); stable third-limited POV with rhythmic control heightening discovery beats. No dialogue; elision of door's mechanics taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "coiled like a sleeping creature"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Zero figurative muddle; opening anchors stakes, final image recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh impossible door to hidden rewrite transforms archival trope into ingenious historical sabotage; risk of quiet CR closure heightens stakes via evidence trust. Non-obvious synthesis of absence fables feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
