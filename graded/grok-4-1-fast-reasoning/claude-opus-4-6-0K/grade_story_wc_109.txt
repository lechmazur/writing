<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oracle's motivation to map silences via glyphs roots deeply in her obsession, shown through concrete interiority like feeling cosmic withdrawal "in her teeth, in the marrow of her wrists." Micro-choices under pressure—climbing switchbacks, painting amid wind—reveal hierarchy of values with life's work as cost. Minor slip: lacks overt contradictory impulses in scene, but endurance of final glyph earns closure without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds from collected glyphs to unprecedented hush converging in final spiral glyph. Orientation anchors early (oracle, ridge fort, last-star night). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page—"the sky went fully dark, and the map was complete"—with conceptual cost of structured darkness legible in final image; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge fort's cracked ramparts and ceaseless wind constrain ascent and painting, charging final glyph amid howling gale. Sensory details selective (wind's moan to teeth-vibrating hush) filter through oracle's silence-obsessed POV. Recurring booklet-as-micro-setting evolves with flaking gold, mirroring hush's tenderness; fort pressures choices without static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to complete night-map signaled early, escalates accumulatively via converging silences to unique marrow-felt hush forcing final glyph. Agency in listening/painting forecloses shore-life path with felt cost of entering starless world. One tightening sufficient: star's flicker narrows to threshold glyph, reweighting stake under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of darkness's hidden structure emerges organically from glyph-map of silences, culminating in resonant CR: "the darkness was not featureless." Final image reweights premise without moral—vast hush as tender map payoff. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in map's corridors of quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, with perceptual signature of silence edges (tidal pool to cosmic hum fade). Rhythm modulates from wind-torn ascent to hushed closure, diction hushed-idiosyncratic ("ambered hush," "marbled hush"). Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at glyph's asymptote spiral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels: lines multi-job (e.g., "flakes of gold leaf drifted... catching the light" advances prop, hush, stakes). No loops/artifacts; purposeful "silence" recurrence pattern-taught accumulates texture. Rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax breathes with hush's arrival; minor overwriting in metaphors contained, clarity untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic dimming mapped via silence-glyphs transforms extinction trope into quiet cartography of hush. Bold lyric risk—obsessive edge-noting as life's paradox—feels inevitable, heightening stakes in final tender darkness. No derivatives; particulars (gold vellum spirals) irreplaceable.</comment>
