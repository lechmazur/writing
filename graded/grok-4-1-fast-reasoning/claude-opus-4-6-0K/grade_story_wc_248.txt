<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fires as grief/rage) act in reflective blocks anchored to present discoveries; final renunciation to catalog earned by message with embodied cost ("knees softened"). Interiority concrete and particular, no diagnostic epiphanies beyond mother's cipher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: trail of creations tightens to circular room's CR/RR closure ("She would portray this place... open it"), cost legible in self-forgiveness line and foreclosed arson path. Orientation anchored early ("three weeks after going off the grid"); no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects (tapestry, portrait) constrain choices and charge final image ("unpinned the faded tapestry... reading its symbols"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (intuits weaves/systems). Micro-setting (chambers, pillar) guides descent without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via art trail to message's tightening; agency in decoding/cataloging forecloses burning with felt emotional cost ("thought about the lending libraries... nearly forgotten"). Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (grief as misplaced tenderness, preservation vs. destruction) emerges organically from particulars; final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("open it") reweighting fires/archive without moralizing. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (reads "systems... stress fractures"); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences at decode: "Maren decoded it with shaking hands"). Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (long descriptive → punchy revelations), propulsion peaks at message ("The face was sacrificed for the message"). Minor figurative consistency ("volcanic tenderness") purposeful, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist finds mother's vandalized self-portrait-archive via art trail, transforming preservation trope; risk in cipher-on-portrait heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight from intuitive trait.</comment>
