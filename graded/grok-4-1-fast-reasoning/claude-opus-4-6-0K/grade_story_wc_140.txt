<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete perceptual shifts and micro-choices like memorizing longshoremen stories, showing contradictory endurance of erasure without reinstatement pursuit; final layering choice earned by prior collecting causality with visible cost of non-restoration. Blind spots in official systems drive inevitable mapping struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment density builds to death certificates discovery; on-page CR closure via layering certificate ("She takes one certificate. She layers it onto her wall") reweights erasure with conceptual cost of visibility over reinstatement, felt in map's growth. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via cabinets suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers as lived-in library constrain choices (tides flood, force ascent) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (overheard voices through walls, rust, leaks) reflects Maren's biased filtering. Tides evolve causally, mirroring internal texture quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of memories amid erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening fragment density to cabinets reversal narrowing options; agency in persistent collecting forecloses reinstatement path with legible endurance cost at layering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges from particulars like poison label integrity beside death certificates, resonating in final map image reweighting visibility as nameless identity without moral statement; subtext in fragment gaps invites ambiguity on truth vs. official record.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("filters reality differently," containers as library); rhythmic control modulates from calm collecting to charged poise at "The map grows," prose texture embodies Maren's fragmented noticing without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "She layers the stories... until a composite history emerges"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors like "archaeologist collects potsherds" integrate without muddle in peak discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and container-maze ghosts transformed via textural mapping; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from poison label to certificates reconfiguring identity premise organically.</comment>
