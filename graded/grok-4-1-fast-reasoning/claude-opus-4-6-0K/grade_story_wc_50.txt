<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and locksmith-specific (oiling gears with patience, peripheral method); motivation intensifies from fatigue with locks to storing wonder via mappings. Mild internal conflict as harmonious discovery dominates, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats. Final endurance (climbing out content) earned by prior micro-choices with felt cost of deferred understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from echo discoveries to timer realization; closure as CR in final image (cavern composes footsteps, timer spirals) reweights premise with conceptual cost of leaving immersion for stored measurements. Orientation anchored early (Maren, cavern, autumn frost). Single tightening via "cavern was composing" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble cavern micro-setting constrains via parabolic echoes/light angles shaping studies; sensory hierarchy (peripheral sounds over visuals) biases via POV. Final image charges with footsteps' composition. Selective details (nautilus crack, frost-killed asters) evolve causally, mirroring internal ripening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock timer's cavern-fed tick) signaled early; textural escalation via deepening pattern break ("echoes...composing," timer as lens). Agency in reverse-engineering forecloses direct arbitration for peripheral storage. Cost legible in seasonal lull endurance and deferred full understanding charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral wonder-ripening emerges organically from echo harvests and spiral timer; final image ("marble collected...began, slowly, to compose") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting direct listening premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "understanding could wait" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (peripheral drifts, stone's "memory"); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed mapping to charged exhale. Diction controlled, syntax reflects locksmith precision. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "harvested versions...thickened by the stone's memory" layers sound/atmosphere); varied rhythm, zero loops/scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful and coherent (prism echoes, nautilus spiral), no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith decodes composing cavern via seized timer, transforming echo tropes into measurable "intervals of wonder." Risky lyric structure heightens textural stakes; irreplaceable nautilus lens recharges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
