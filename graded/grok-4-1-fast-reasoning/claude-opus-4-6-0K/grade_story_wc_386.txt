<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied shrine perception and dream interpretations; motivation to salvage pure truth compels cautious resolve with visible cost in final threading commitment. Grandmother's warning anchors reflective block to present globe-handling micro-choice. Contradictory caution versus bold exposure acts in scene, earning closure renunciation of rashness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream revelations builds to unbidden cameo as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure where she crystallizes precise case-building with felt dismissal risk. Orientation anchored in opening lines (Maren, shrine, post-wreck). Cost legible in "building a case so precise that no one could dismiss it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and snow globe constrain choices (amplifies voices, touched for dreams) and charge final image of carried starlight. Sensory details (candle lean/exhale, ice refraction) selectively mirror internal attunement via POV bias. Environment evolves causally with glacier's "exhalation" bookending rite.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose sabotage via dreams) signaled early, tightens via new dream cameo narrowing to targeted pursuit; agency in analysis/ritual forecloses dismissal path with on-page cost. Escalation as density increase under Accumulative lens coheres to Charged Poise. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of careful truth-weaving emerges from dream particulars and globe evidence, reweighted by final image of starlight/names without moralizing. Resonance from sabotage/cover-up complexity avoids tidy binaries. Protagonist arc inextricable from salvaging purity amid contamination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in ice/light/dream diction; rhythmic modulation builds to crystalline final lines. Purposeful compression of backstory interleaves with present globe rite. No head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy revelations amid lyric flow); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—shrine "breathing" consistent and propulsive. Propulsion peaks in dream cascade without overwriting. Final line recharges opening starlight motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving, dream cameos as ghost channels, and melted globe as sabotage proof transforms supernatural mystery. Risky lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes via unbidden dream turn. Inevitable in hindsight from journal setup.</comment>
