<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory reverence for withholding versus revelation drives her micro-choices, earning Cael's shift; her backward aging integrates as motivation without exposition dump. Cael's grief payoff feels character-bound via trance access. Final endurance of her curriculum costs simplicity reclaimed yearly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wave observation density builds to interference CR, reweighting vanishing with conceptual cost in grief relocation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, no shards, closure image ("trance held them both like water holds a stone") pays off with undeniable before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains via sternum pull and light spirals, charging final pulse beneath them. Pond rings as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal states through POV filter. Sensory hierarchy (iron veins holding stars) reflects Lira's alignment without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing grief) signaled early, tightens via interference patterns narrowing to redistributed energy insight under Accumulative lens. Agency in observation/renunciation forecloses literal disappearance. Cost legible in Cael's caught breath, though more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence relocated emerges via wave particulars, not statement; final "look at the right part of the pond" reconfigures premise non-literally. Subtext in withheld rings invites ambiguity on grief without tidy moral. Resonance from Lira's backward peeling anchors protagonist arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable in Lira, perceptual signature (sycamore hush, star-bent light) biased to her alignment; dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Do they?"). Rhythm modulates with trance intensity. No head-hopping, elision taught via rings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in ring progression; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("dark mouth under starlight") purposeful without muddle in peak insight. Opening anchors voice, final image recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Backward aging + wave vanishing synthesizes fresh angle on grief; risk in Accumulative trance structure heightens resonance without gimmick. Transformation test passes: elements inseparable from closure CR. No template echoes.</comment>
