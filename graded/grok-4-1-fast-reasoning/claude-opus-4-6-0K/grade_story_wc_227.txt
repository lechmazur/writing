<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses embodied in "tremor in her hands" amid desperate belief; final dive earned by prior mending choices foreclosing retreat. Uncertainty as flaw drives competent struggle without hedging. No diagnostic labels; voice particular through scar-mapping obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: repair density builds to resonance hum → descent, with on-page CR closure as "something opened" reconfigures oblivion into luminous unknown. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "dissolve into the same green nothing." Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acid sea and gears constrain choices (hissing pontoons force timed dive, cradle amplifies); final image charges with "vitriol rose around her ankles, warm and electric." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pockmarks as language); no white-room, vivid integration via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode lost world) tightens accumulatively via gold-sealing success forcing underwater commitment; agency in descent forecloses safety with breath-limit cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive deepening at hum narrows options unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges from particulars (gold veins stitching memories), reweighted in final "golden scars... blazed like a constellation" without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from arc; ambiguity lingers in unknown opening, counter-readings plausible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (scars as constellations); rhythmic control modulates from uncertain hover to propulsion in descent. Lyrical diction voice-motivated, no leakage; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (each gold stroke a "syllable restored"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent/patterned ("wound refusing to close" echoes kintsugi), zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic alchemy + kintsugi resonance transforms tropes organically; risk in solo acid-dive heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from pockmark pattern to opening; no derivative echoes.</comment>
