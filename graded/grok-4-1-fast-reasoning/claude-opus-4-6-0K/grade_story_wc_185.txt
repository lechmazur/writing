<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Characterization excels through Seren's expertise turning cracks into "language," compelling her descent and endurance with embodied patience; final endurance forecloses flight with felt isolation cost. Contradictory resolve—staying amid chaos—earns closure choice. No unearned epiphanies; traits constrain via micro-choices like tracing fractures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation accumulates to mental map, descent, chamber discovery, and conjuring resolve into RR closure ("bloom of hush spread outward") with hard-won cost legible in "shaped, alive with the memory of everything it had absorbed." Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration—ice cracks as "fossilized sound," ripple walls as "fingerprints"—constrains choices, charging final chamber image; POV bias sharpens to professional priorities. Micro-setting (echo stone, cracks) guides tactics; no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find quiet in storm) signaled early, escalates via deepening map from ripples to cracks, narrowing to convergence; agency in conjuring forecloses chaos with visible cost (stone absorbs vibrations, dust settles). Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance wrung from collision emerges organically via particulars—gaps in hum filled by countersound—reweighting premise in final "quality of the quiet... alive with memory" without moralizing. Resonance from conflict, not abstraction; invites reflection on expertise amid chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("every ripple mark... told her where sound traveled"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, compressing under descent stress. Voice distinct, biased to sonic geology; no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful ("veins of quartz through granite") propel without muddle. Rhythm varies for propulsion—short sentences in conjuring build hush; closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic mapkeeper conjuring destructive interference vs plasma migrants transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract physics grounded via concrete tools/cracks heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from established pattern; no derivatives.</comment>
