<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hyper-perceptive yet pacifist refusal of father's recruitment) act in scene via engraving/sheathing micro-choices; final endurance of her habit earns stasis with cost of world's/Father's chaos. Embodied perception (root creak, hawk pressure) particularizes interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: textural density of routines builds to Charged Poise closure ("Maren let it break... it was enough") reconfiguring continuity stake with undeniable opportunity cost (father's path foreclosed). Orientation anchored early (tower fall, dome); no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome/soil/smoke column constrain choices (protects work amid aftershocks) and charge final image (inside warmth vs. outside blaze); sensory hierarchy POV-biased (plant pulses over distant ruin). Micro-setting (knife, caudex) tethers pivotal engraving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity) signaled early, tightens texturally via engraving progression/sandbag integration to foreclose violence option; cost legible in final poise (world breaks unheeded). Agency in endurance under lens reweights with felt isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (growth amid ruin) emerges organically from engravings/sandbag; final image resonantly reconfigures "engraved quiet" without moral, inviting ambiguity (her habit "enough" vs. Father's chase). Particulars (patience rose) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (involuntary thoroughness: dome tremble, cambium ink) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates calm intensity. Stable close-third POV with clean free indirect (whispered "Patience"); no elision or slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (every line advances perception/action); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent/purposeful ("smoke... architectural"); no artifacts dull closure image ("sky blazed its quiet amber").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: value-engraving roses transforms post-apoc trope via "senselessly perceptive" pacifism; plant-whispering/idiosyncratic details (cambium etching) feel inevitable, risking quiet stasis over action.</comment>
