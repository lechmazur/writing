<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in choral background and talismanic weight compels the activation choice with embodied resolve; strength in "empathetically decisive" shown via steady action amid grief, though internal contradiction leans more reflective than simultaneous impulses in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers of backstory and setup build to on-page Charged Poise closure with the tower singing and city answering; 11-year silence breaks with felt cost in final image of warm, vibrating weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight through cracked dome constrains gentle urgency and charges final eyes-closed moment; grain elevators as resonators mirror thematic divide, with selective sensory hierarchy via Maren's musical lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sonic bridging signaled early tightens via activation under Accumulative lens, foreclosing silence with communal cost felt below; minor abstractness in off-page response slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coexistence of languages reconfigures silos into bridges via song cascade, resonant in final tender break without moralizing; theme emerges organically from choral weaving and weight's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("music was a language beneath all languages"); rhythmic modulation heightens activation without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from climb to closure; no loops, purposeful figurative layering ("small, steady forces") enhances without muddling peak carillon beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multicultural carillon bridging concrete grain elevators transforms separation trope; risk in sonic amphitheaters heightens stakes organically to inevitable tender vigor.</comment>
