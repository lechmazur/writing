<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses embodied in the writing process ("both true at the same time"); micro-choices like borrowing the inkwell reveal values under pressure. Final promises earn a meaningful renunciation of silence with relational cost. Minor abstract phrasing in reflection doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from letter-reading to promise-weaving to Charged Poise closure as Maren steps out, reconfiguring silence with cost (fear of response, timed divergence). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via Hittite method suffices. Cost legible in "just in time or not at all."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inkwell as micro-setting constrains honesty ("keep her honest") and charges final return ("borrowed heartbeat"). Archive details selectively filter through linguist's bias, mirroring internal polyphony. Environment guides choice without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore before divergence) signaled early; textural deepening via promises narrows options with agency (writing despite fear). Cost felt in "afraid of what you might say" and envelope timing. Minor limit: internal pressure lacks visceral external test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dissonant truths emerges organically from Hittite promises and polyphonic reflection, answered non-literally in final "living deserve translation." Particulars like sediment silence reweight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (harmonic structures, emotional geometries); rhythmic modulation peaks in promise clauses. Voice texture distinct and biased to linguist's idiom, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "frozen breath" integrate without muddle or loops. Varied syntax breathes with reflection-to-action cadence; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arcane linguistics transforms family rift via Hittite oaths and symphonies. Risk in polyphonic promises heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
