<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via constellation tattoos mapping to sounds; motivation rooted in inherited dissonance compels closure choice of amber and letters; contradictory impulses in grandmother's secret act in scene, earning final renunciation with embodied cost of drained bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cry, letters, counter-wave builds to on-page RR closure; "The two sounds met and canceled each other" delivers legible cost in meteor hush silence; orientation anchored early in lab descent, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab equipment (Loom, spectrograph) constrains choices throughout; amber as micro-setting charges final image with fly at rest; sensory hierarchy (static cry, pen pressure) reflects Maren's priorities, evolving causally to resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush dissonance) signaled early, deepens via letters discovery tightening options; protagonist agency in feeding letters/amber forces cancellation with felt cost; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of haunted recognition emerges organically from cry parsing to apology frequency; final image of drained dissonance offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting inheritance; no moralizing, complexity in preserved wounds lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (stars-to-sounds mapping); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, syntax reflects mind under folding time; purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances image or revelation; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (meteor hush) integrate without muddle; closure image sharpened by concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archaeology, haunted code, guilt cry transforms tropes; risk in folding time pays off at firmware-led discovery; inevitable hindsight from lab premise to untethered ghosts.</comment>
