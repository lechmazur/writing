<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's conviction shift is earned through embodied reactions like feeling Sorel's attention "like a hand pressed gently against her sternum," with contradictory impulses (prove history vs. accept nuance) acting in the final reach for the ampoule. Sorel's incisively kind telepathy compels higher-stakes revelations without safety-hedging. Grandmother's backstory anchors via deathbed cue and tilts Maren's present choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density cascades "each one restructured the one before it," tightening to Charged Poise closure where Maren holds ampoule and rejects simplification, with cost legible in "felt the shape of her conviction shift" and stone's "relief." Orientation anchored early in dive through silted garden. Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden setting (coral "threaded through trellises," anemones "pulsed") constrains dive and charges final image: light through ampoule "scattered across the garden... making everything glow as if breathing." Sensory hierarchy diver-specific (lamp sweeping silt); mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Velisse truth) signaled early, escalates via lens-driven revelation deepening that narrows certainty options; agency in Maren's reach/speech forecloses simplification path. Cost unmistakable in conviction reconfiguration paralleling uncontrollable coral growth. Moral calculus between proof and nuance sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed compromise/habitual beauty emerges organically from garden mimicry and revelations; final image non-literally answers "prove what happened" by scattering light over stone/coral, reweighting heroes/villains with nuance cost. Subtext in Sorel's "kind... enough to cut and compassionate enough to suture." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with diver's perceptual signature (silted light, regulator hiss); voice modulates rhythmically with telepathic texture ("emotional grain of three hundred years"). Sparse dialogue goal-driven (Maren's aloud tethering); free indirect clean. No head-hopping despite telepathy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines like "beauty were a habit the ocean could not break" advance atmosphere/character/theme without loops. Rhythm varies (short regulator hisses amid long revelations); no artifacts, figurative coherence (coral restructures garden as revelations do conviction). Propulsion peaks in fractured light image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mind-threaded statue in calcium vein transforms drowning trope via garden's animate-dead mimicry; risk in telepathic kindness heightens nuance stakes without gimmick. Revelations inevitable from established flaw-pattern; no template echoes.</comment>
