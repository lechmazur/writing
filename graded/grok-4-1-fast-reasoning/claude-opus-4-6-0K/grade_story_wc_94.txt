<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses embodied in "everything burned at a frequency too high for sound," compelling the shift from vigil to writing with clear cost of prior silence. Final choice earned by scar-mapping obsession and poem discovery. Minor poetic abstraction doesn't dull peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds vigil pattern to envelope discovery tightening stakes, lands Charged Poise closure in "She picked up her pen... she wrote it anyway," with legible cost of unpublishability. One meaningful deepening suffices; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains vigil via "air... thin it could rarefy thought," charges final image as "observatory groaned against the wind like a living thing." Sensory hierarchy (ozone, cold grating) mirrors internal scars/storm. Micro-setting (timer, platform) tethers choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar cartography to break silence) signaled early, deepens texturally via discovery forcing mask-slip endurance to action; cost unmistakable in unpublishable writing. Agency in timer neglect and pen pickup forecloses stasis path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of witness-without-audience emerges organically from scars, silence-as-country, father's poem; final "mapping every scar... toward morning" reweights premise non-literally with cost of isolation. Particulars avoid platitudes; charged ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in poet's lyric notices ("lightning stitched... surgical thread"); rhythmic control modulates from tranquil vigil to "rain falling upward" at peak, heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (each line advances texture/stakes); varied rhythm propels to closure without overwriting—peak "words came... single drops" clean and vivid. Metaphors coherent, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet's storm vigil, father's hidden poem in bus timetable transforms isolation trope; risk in accumulative lyric heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight payoff in scar-mapping morning.</comment>
