<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through pattern-tracing worldview and embodied grief (fingers smelling of hemp), with endurance of unseen charting earned as stasis; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting prevents perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building observations to CR closure ("tying a knot between what exists and what is known"); cost of demure, unseen labor legible in final descent image; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Parapet whispers and wet grass constrain observation choice and charge whisk framing moment; sensory hierarchy (net-mender's tactile brine/smell, firefly geometry) mirrors priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding patterns escalates texturally through overlaid charts to reweighted commitment; agency in patient witnessing forecloses apathy with felt cost of isolation, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from nets/fireflies/mother's knots, resonating in non-literal final image of witnessing as mending without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geometry in panic, moon-paths) with rhythmic modulation; stable close-third POV biases toward patterns, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (whisk "sang its tiny, frothing song"); figurative language purposeful without muddle or loops in peak observation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mender charting firefly moon-paths transforms quiet observation into philosophical audacity; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes of unseen work.</comment>
