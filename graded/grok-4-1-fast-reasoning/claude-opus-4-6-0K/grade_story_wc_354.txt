<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via worry stone dent as time measure and precise mapping tying backstory to present choice; contradictory hope vs. past betrayal acts in scene through letter preparation, earning quiet move with exile's cost. Final stance renunciation of bitterness feels fully motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reflection to letter act as Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring hope with uncertainty cost legible in "She had made her quiet move." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; reflection anchors tilt present without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt outcrop and iron-rich stones constrain via magnetic mapping of boundaries, charging final image; twilight progression ("color of hopeful melancholy") mirrors stakes through POV bias. Sensory integration (hum, violet sky, magnetic wind) evolves purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewal exposure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via nexus mapping tying to charter window; timeframe forecloses inaction with felt uncertainty cost in letter trust. Agency in quiet move narrows options coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence translation emerges organically via chess lessons to land memory, resonating in final image without statement; "quiet moves" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of daughters' response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in precise color shades ("hopeful melancholy") and chess-patterned thought; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., dent worn "deeper now than when she had first arrived"); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in "She stood, brushed the basalt dust from her knees."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic land-memory and chess coordinates transforms exile trope; risk in lyric reflection pays off via nexus-charged closure, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
