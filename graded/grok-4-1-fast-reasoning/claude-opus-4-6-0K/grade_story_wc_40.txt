<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—reticence fears building's echo yet persists in silent observation—and final endurance of recording despite grief is earned by prior micro-choices like pressing crystal to eye, with visible cost in shrinking handwriting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in final image of "suspended hush" deepening to "presence of listening," reconfiguring her stake from decoding to witnessing with undeniable loss of libraries' past sounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed library and crystal constrain choices (silent movement, seasonal light angles) and charge final image of fractured light on hands/notebook; sensory hierarchy (visual spectra over sound hush) reflects POV priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode growth signaled early tightens via deepening realization of "growth rings" through crystal, narrowing to endurance under lens; cost felt in grief interrupting sequences and foreclosed path of clean equations, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of warmth and "presence of listening" offers resonant answer to loss-of-language premise, reweighting patterns as accumulated meaning without moral; emerges organically from crystal motifs shifting via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light's breaking" patterns and rhythmic modulation (short precise sentences in observation beats) heighten pressure; stable close-third POV with no elision, prose as character reflecting reticent precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "dawn parse itself through the crystal's facets" doing triple duty (advance, image, propulsion); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops/artifacts even in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language-riot world with crystal's "learning" patterns transforms lost-knowledge trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via growing refractions inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
