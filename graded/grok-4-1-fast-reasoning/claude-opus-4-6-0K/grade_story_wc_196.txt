<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in her own file's omissions, with contradictory impulses (heartbreak vs. mission) acting in her micro-choices like rewriting the pencil note; final endurance of daily heartbreak earned with visible cost in "she let it."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchored instantly in file room and law; closure as Charged Poise in final folder pull reconfigures her mission with undeniable emotional cost made legible in dust motes' illumination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dust patterns and shelving constrain her forensic reading and charge final image of motes "briefly illuminated, settling again into patience"; sensory selectivity (paper-earth smell, patina light) reflects her hopeful bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of magnifying kindnesses signaled early tightens texturally via button anomaly and her inventory choice, foreclosing indifference with cost in "work that broke her heart daily"; agency in preservation forces trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of persistent kindness emerges implicitly from particulars like Mr. Alderman's note and her rewrite; final image resonant reconfiguration reweights clinical records without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on love's visibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "geologist reads sediment"; rhythmic control modulates from clinical to lyrical poise, diction biased toward tactile traces without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in lines like "pencil fades and she wanted those words to survive"; varied rhythm propels to charged closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival forensics and foster trauma transforms trope via dust-button method; risk in quiet accumulative closure heightens stakes through her flawed persistence.</comment>
