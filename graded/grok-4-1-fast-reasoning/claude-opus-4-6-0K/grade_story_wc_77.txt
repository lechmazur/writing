<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in staring at repulsive glow despite fear; Maren's paradox speech compels confession, earning her unblurred reflection with visible cost of endured bile/wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds luminance density to pattern break; "mirrors cracked in sequence... luminance bled out" delivers CR/RR closure with legible cost in evaporation and ordinary darkness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors' warm/wet glass and throbbing glow constrain speech choice and charge final shard image; sensory filter via Maren's heartbeat distrust anchors POV specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Speech as agency deepens stake under textural lens, forcing unbosoming reversal that narrows options; cost unmistakable in "torrent of whispered truths" tasting "bile and wonder."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dictionary notes and confession emerge theme organically; shard's "ordinary, beautiful, uncorrupted darkness" offers resonant answer reweighting fear's need without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (glow as "repulsive... magnetic"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel seamlessly; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "repulsion braided with fascination" heighten without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Funhouse paradox transforms resurrection-haunt trope via dictionary method; "fear's temple and fear's trap" infuses fresh ingenuity that risks poetic horror payoff.</comment>
