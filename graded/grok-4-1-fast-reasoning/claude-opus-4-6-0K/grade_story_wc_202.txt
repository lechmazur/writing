<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to archive histories is rooted in concrete traits and intuition, earning the endurance of her quest; micro-choices like pressing the fragment reveal values under subtle pressure from Oxanna. Interiority concrete via bodily knowing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the revelation beat. Oxanna applies targeted pressure without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market entry to lens resonance and unfastening, culminating in Charged Poise RR where past/present suspends with conceptual cost of "nothing lost, only waiting." Orientation anchored early; lens fragment as persistent constraint shapes tactics. No ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Market sways and glitters constrain the suspended final image, charging closure; lens fragment as micro-setting/object handled tactilely (pocket warmth, pressed to canvas). Sensory selection POV-biased (intuition over sight), vivid yet economical. Lighthouse shore mirrors internal knowing without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (38th painting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Oxanna's recognition and name-luminosity revelation, narrowing to unfastening with reverent cost. Agency in pressing fragment forces trade-off (not buying, but reading/taking). Escalation coherent under lens, cost felt in "lifting a sleeping child."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden histories emerges organically from paintings' encoded names and final "sentence between two languages," reweighting overlooked knowledge without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (43 alchemists, lens match); invites ambiguity on memory's fragility. Protagonist arc inextricable from honoring via archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (half-here intuition, bone-colored silk); voice lyrical, rhythm modulates to charged poise in final sway. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("not for sale"/"to read it"), advances via recognition. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes, rhythm varies (short revelation sentences amid lyric flow). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; opening anchors voice, final image recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear perfect, figurative language pattern-taught for accumulative payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market, intuition-translation, and encoded paintings transforms hidden-history trope via lens fragment's physics and grandmother's legacy. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes in eternal-instant closure. No derivatives; particulars (prismatic fracture) feel inevitable.</comment>
