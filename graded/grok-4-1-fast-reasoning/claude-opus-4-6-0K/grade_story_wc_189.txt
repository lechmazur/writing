<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied observation of transitions, with jade cicada anchoring reflection to present micro-choice of showing crab; contradictory impulses (no argument, tangential show) act in scene, earning final invitation; voices distinct in sparse, subtextual dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from opening catalogs to crab molt tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure in "Then watch with me" amid turning tide; cost legible in fragile new skin and breathing grotto; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools constrain choices (widest pool separates, eastern wall converges light for crab); sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's priorities (anemones survived storm, blenny darts); final tide pull charges image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (funding end vs. continue chronicles) signaled early, tightens texturally via crab molt forcing Dao's "I want to help"; agency in Maren's foreseen tangential show forecloses argument path; cost visible in vulnerable new body and encroaching tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically via cicada, pauses, crab—final set cicada "wings aimed at the stars" offers resonant reconfiguration without moral; subtext in Dao's grief and shared watch invites ambiguity on persistence's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of transitional granularity ("slack water between tides"); dialogue goal-driven ("You understand why I can't stop"), indirection in pauses; rhythmic modulation peaks in whisper at molt.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("shafts of starlight converged... old carapace splitting"); varied syntax propels from catalog to climax without loops or scaffolds; no figurative muddle, precise embodiment throughout.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine observation as persuasion tactic transforms funding rejection trope; risk in quiet poise heightens stakes via textural inevitability; cicada/crabs particularize voice memorably.</comment>
