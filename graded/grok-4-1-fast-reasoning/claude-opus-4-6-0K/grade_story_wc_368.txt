<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between Sable's cautious dye-master observation and the donor heart's "quietly explosive" urgency act simultaneously, earning the final writing choice with embodied cost at sternum palpation. Interiority particular through color-reading lens. Oku applies subtle pressure via wing gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via daily mappings to ninth-morning CR closure where wing's transparency reconfigures Ren's allure with personal cost of self-disappearance. Orientation anchored early in tea house arrival. One tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Morpho wing as micro-setting constrains choices (pinned post, rotated) and charges final image of dissolution. Mist/sun trails filter through dye-master bias, guiding observations. Sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher Ren's magnetism) deepens accumulatively via pattern emergence, narrowing to wing's transparency forcing stance reconfiguration. Agency in tracking; cost legible in merged rhythms foreclosing caution. One tightening coheres under lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of structural iridescence emerges organically from wing/light parallels to Ren, answered non-literally in transparent moment reweighting Sable's premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with dye-master perceptual signature (hue shifts as "argument for blue"). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates dawn urgency purposefully. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer observation/insight without loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm peaks in "blue dissolved entirely into transparency." Zero figurative muddle; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of donor-heart quest with morpho iridescence transforms introspection trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via light's "stages." Inevitable hindsight from early color obsession.</comment>
