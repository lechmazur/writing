<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fluctuating moon-phase selves show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in routine actions like fishing and cataloging; final endurance of staying earned by prior acceptance with cost of isolation. Delicate woman in "giant's skeleton" contradiction embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early in atrium and endless day. Final "stood still in the silver water... day that would not end" reconfigures sameness with conceptual cost of perpetual tending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal floods constrain titan-gear choices and folio rescue; recurring "rhomboids of light" and kelp charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (water drag, mineral smell) reflects librarian priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wonder vs. routine signaled early, accumulates texturally via phases to final deepening in folio cradle/stand; forecloses leaving with felt cost of endless alone-tending. Agency in wading despite drag crystallizes endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wonder-through-contradiction emerges organically from fish-metal routine and phase-shifts; final image reweights premise non-literally as "miracle" shared across selves without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual wonder-bias stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "paper bird" image. Patterned elision of phases taught early, legible at Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "hydraulic joints compensated for the drag"); varied rhythm propels to vivid final propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fish-smelting in library transforms apocalypse stasis into wonder-preservation synthesis; fluctuating identities risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
