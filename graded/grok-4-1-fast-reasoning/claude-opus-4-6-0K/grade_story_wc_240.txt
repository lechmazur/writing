<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guarding perimeters vs. feeling gaps) act in scene through shaking hands and palm on screen; final report rewrite earns renunciation of defenses with emotional cost. Interiority concrete and embodied (mycelium as eyelashes on skin). Backstory anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in report rewrite and final image ("lets the light pass through her"), with felt cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early ("mushroom farm before the echo of morning birdsong"). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm (blue/green glow, spores as inverted snow) charges final image (mushrooms pulse like held breath released); mesh screen constrains touch enabling mycelium contact. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (permeability felt like weather in fractures). Micro-setting (humidity curtain, substrate) guides tests purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe permeability to grasp letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sleepless fascination, shaking hands, and screen touch narrowing guarded stance. Agency in micro-choices (laser test, palm placement) forecloses defensive path with report rewrite cost. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Permeability-as-connection theme emerges organically from fungal signals and ex-wife reflection, reweighted non-literally in "Barrier integrity was never the point" without moralizing. Final image resonates as answer to guarding flaw. Particulars (mycelium threading mesh) drive earned insight over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (boundaries as living membranes); rhythmic diction modulates fascination ("quiet wildfire of light"). Prose as character: syntax reflects analytical yet opening mind. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (lines multilayered, e.g., "every boundary... living membrane"); varied rhythm accelerates insight without loops. Minor figurative density ("cathedral... dreaming," "stars too close") purposeful for tone, not muddling closure. Clean propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion specialist's spatial gift applied to emotional barriers via bioluminescent mycelium yields inevitable CR. Transforms trope of guarded heart through fungal logic. Bold quiet ending risks/heights stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
