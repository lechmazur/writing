<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied emotion (sternum ache from A440) and micro-choices under pressure (adjusting intervals despite past mistakes), earning the closure act; her voiceless survival flaw drives motivation without tidy resolution. Contradictory impulses surface in imperfect sequences that felt like accusations, complicating her project authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from backstory anchor to testing forks to full-sequence climax; orientation crystal-clear in opening lines; closure delivers Charged Poise via final strike ("I am here... to begin again") with conceptual cost in her ruined throat's vibration and imperfect smile carried outward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains choices (repels fog, amplifies pure tones only) and charges final image (notes sent through panels to muted city); sensory hierarchy acoustic-focused via POV bias; micro-setting as body/tool (glass convergence point) elevates integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via error rectification to full broadcast; agency in sequential strikes forecloses voiceless isolation with felt cost (throat vibration); one tightening suffices, charging stranger's distant response without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of surviving harmony ("unshaken marvels") emerges organically from pure-tone mappings, reweighting Severance premise in final image (stranger's unnamed warmth); resonant non-literal answer to silence via imperfect smile "carried anyway," embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (acoustic precision: "shimmering column of sound"); rhythmic control modulates from calm testing to climactic braiding; no elision issues, diction biased to frequencies and embodiment sustains under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, exceptional density (e.g., "glass panels caught each frequency and braided them"); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, metaphors purposeful/coherent (sound "like water through crystal"); peak beats clear, propulsive without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh Severance premise (discord dies, pure emotions survive) transforms apocalypse via frequency-emotion synthesis; risk-taking in tonal language heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration inevitable from acoustic logic, no hedging.</comment>
