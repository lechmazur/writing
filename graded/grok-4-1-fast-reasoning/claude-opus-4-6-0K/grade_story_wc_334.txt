<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and interior contradiction in "weeping broke forty years of careful habit," earning the raw self's emergence with visible cost; chronically curious trait shown concretely via music box disassembly, compelling the return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of broken constellations taught via photo early, tightening to memory voices returning; closure as RR in "stories had risen," reweighting loss with emotional cost legible in "heavier than she remembered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse as lens warps stars, constraining the detection choice; shipwrecks' skeletal ring charges final step-over, mirroring sunk/risen tension without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery signaled early tightens via constellation study under Accumulative lens, foreclosing compensated life with habit-breaking cost in weeping and trembling hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss/restoration emerges via sinking greenhouse vs rising stories, resonant in final image reweighting premise without moral; ambiguity in "phantom limb" ache lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in body-memory measures ("iron doorframe... now met her ribs"); rhythmic control modulates from crisp observation to charged release, POV stable and biased to folkloric curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "branches pressing white... like hands trying to push free of water"; no loops, propulsion peaks in memory voices without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore encoding in broken constellations transforms memory-loss trope; risk in magical realism integrates seamlessly, inevitable in hindsight via photo seed.</comment>
