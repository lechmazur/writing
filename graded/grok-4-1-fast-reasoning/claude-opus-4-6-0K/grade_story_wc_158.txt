<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shyly unstoppable paradox shown through unflinching centuries of kelp-writing despite flinching shadow, earning sleep acceptance; contradictory impulses in vigil vs. relief embodied in final gratitude. Interiority particular via squid-ink verses and postcard compass. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses wakefulness path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pain-transmuting builds to wind/lullabies cadence shift, yielding Charged Poise closure in sleep acceptance reconfiguring centuries' vigil. Cost legible in "tide of sleep approaching like a kindness she might accept." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no shards, single reflective scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell constrains ensconcement and growth around her, charging final image; nacre walls, kelp pages, bioluminescent curtains filter through poet's priorities. Postcard as micro-setting recharges at touch where "spiral seemed to turn." Sensory hierarchy urgent in wind's dissonance vs. dim chamber calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insomnia from war, pain-photosynthesis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via returning lullabies signaling armistice, forcing sleep-stance crystallization. Agency in endurance/writing yields world's change; cost of centuries felt in "last waking thought... gratitude." One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-beauty photosynthesis emerges via kelp verses washing ashore, orchard seeds; final orchard fruit image resonantly reweights premise without moral. Postcard's "blossoming forgives everything" subtextually anchors without statement. Complexity in war's fault-line ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close yields perceptual signature of photosynthetic metaphors (e.g., "black radiation of grief... transmute... into something that could feed the living"); rhythm modulates from spiraling build to quiet closure. Stable distance, no elision or head-hopping; prose reflects poet's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job via image-action (e.g., "verses accumulated in drifts... like sedimentary memory"). Rhythmic variety in openings/paragraphs; purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle or loops. Zero scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-cathedral poet photosynthesizing war-pain into global armistice via smuggled kelp-poems; galaxy postcard self-from-future transforms stasis trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight in sleep after "shell kept growing around her."</comment>
