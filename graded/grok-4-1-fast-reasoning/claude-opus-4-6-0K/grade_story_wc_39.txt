<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Particularized motivation via music box backstory anchors present task with embodied longing; internal endurance of "mad" belief compels sealing without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but fits wistful coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in sealing jar ("for whoever comes after"); cost legible in dunes' burial contrasting his archive; orientation anchored early in loft/dunes/dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt-warped timber, dune grass through floorboards constrain table/windowsill setup; final shelf charges image; sensory hierarchy (sounds dominant) mirrors poet's bias without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vanishing sounds) signaled early tightens via wind/surf filling melody gaps; agency in stillness/sealing forecloses inaction with felt cost of time/ruin; one deepening suffices under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of rescue vs. loss emerges from jars/music box without statement; final label reweights particulars (ruin/renewal) resonantly, inviting ambiguity of hope's futility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic texture ("fingers ink-stained down to the knuckle"); perceptual signature on sounds/textures modulates rhythmically; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("pink bled into gray"); varied syntax propels without loops or muddled figures; figurative poeticism taught early, supports voice without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh sound-jar archive transforms "mad artist" trope via generational acoustics; music box/sea synthesis inevitable, risks whimsy but grounds in tactile specificity charging close.</comment>
