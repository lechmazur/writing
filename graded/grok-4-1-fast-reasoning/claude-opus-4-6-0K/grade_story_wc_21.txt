<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nadia's solemn drive and embodied visions (vertigo, Ruth's terror) compel high-stakes descent and parley; final endurance of visions resolves with earned radiance after negotiation. Interior contradiction shines in ignoring Dr. Yusuf's warning for truth. Thomas's pressure reveals her restoration motive authentically. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like necessity-born solemnity complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: diary discovery patterns into visions, descent, parley tightening density to Charged Poise closure where final vision dissolves post-recovery, reweighting stake with emotional cost ("searing moment, then gently dissolved"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; shards taught early via timeline cues. No causality breaks; cost legible in shaking grief yielding to open air.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains descent/parley and charges final image (coastline glitters like crushed obsidian, dunes erase footprints). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (foxed ink stains, magnolia/sweat); selective vividness mirrors urgency. Spatial choreography coherent across gondola-to-dunes; recurring black water motif evolves with evidence reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover erased truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via visions trapping Nadia, negotiation narrowing options with Thomas's scrutiny. Agency in persuading captain, solo descent, parley forces trade-off (truth vs. consumption). Cost unmistakable in vision bursts shaking her; closure crystallizes stance with foreclosed path felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of history's silences pulling archivist inside emerges organically from diary visions to Ruth's smile across decades; final rail image reweights premise (recovered memory vs. erased footprints) without moral. Subtext in debris negotiation implies guarded truth; ambiguity lingers in solemn burning. No tidy binaries; complexity in institutional distrust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (truth in tension, foxed ink); rhythmic control modulates from drifting zeppelin to searing vision. Prose texture luminous/furious like Ruth's voice; Dr. Yusuf dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; distance tightens immersively in visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "cipher broke open, and Ruth's voice flooded through"); varied rhythm, no loops/paraphrase. Figuratives purposeful/selective (zeppelin as "thought refusing to land") without muddle in peaks. Clean syntax, strong verbs; opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zeppelin archive + psychometric diary + debris parley synthesize fresh civil-rights recovery frame; risk of visions consuming archivist heightens stakes organically. Debris messages transform negotiation trope; inevitability in Ruth's smile callback. No derivative echoes; bold mosaic holds clarity.</comment>
