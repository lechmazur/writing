<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wise pruner's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like aching knees amid radiant hope; motivation intensifies from past failures to seed-planting choice with visible fatigue cost. Final endurance/renunciation of separation feels earned by forty years' causal buildup. No safety-hedging; flaws like age complicate but fuel resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from thinning seams to radiant parapet closure as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring fading world with her physical cost legible in "old and her knees ached." Single scene anchors orientation early ("pruning on a hillside"); one tightening via seed discovery-to-growth. Experimental seam-pruning pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (mist shimmer, color hum in teeth) filters through pruner's priorities, constraining choices like widest seam at parapet. Final colors on moss/ferns charge closure image, evolving causally with essence capture. No white-room; micro-setting (crack in stone) mirrors renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed methods to essence-distilling success, narrowing options with her embodied strain. Agency in "pruned... the membrane" forecloses separation; cost unmistakable in dusk growth amid soaked fatigue. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's bleed emerges organically from fading blossoms to tree's impossible hues reweighting premise; final "radiant hush... like a blessing" resonates non-literally without moralizing. Particulars like sigils/songs ground complexity; no tidy binary, ambiguity in thinning seams lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with pruner-specific perceptual signature ("every cut was a doorway"); diction/rhythm modulate from quiet roar to aching gold under pressure. Purposeful compression teaches seam pattern early, pays off legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light pooled... hummed at a frequency she felt in her teeth" advances action/atmosphere/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Vivid propulsion peaks in growth beat without overwriting; opening "every cut was a doorway" anchors, final shears recharge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms portal trope via pruner-specific seams/world-weaving; risk of lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes in thinning urgency without gimmick. Ingenuity in grafting/essence methods feels inevitable from particulars; no template echoes, bold premise commits fully.</comment>
