<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lukewarm mage's inadequacy as strength emerges in "warm, not hot" magic coaxing edges via drip rhythm; final weeping relief forecloses cynicism with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via drip intervals tightening magic to seal; on-page RR closure in imperfect mend ("faint line remained") steadying stars with emotional cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic stake signaled early tightens via quickening drips forcing adjustment; agency in patient coaxing narrows to imperfect seal with relief cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brittle devotion motif reconfigures via crack's memory to held lattice, resonant in cradled bell/weeping without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in drip-as-silence-between-notes and sunlight-through-glass holds under stress; rhythmic modulation peaks cleanly at seal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm echoing drips; zero loops or muddle, peak "metal resisted, then softened" propels flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drip-metronome for cosmic mend transforms mage inadequacy trope into inevitable synthesis; risk in quiet patience heightens stakes organically.</comment>
