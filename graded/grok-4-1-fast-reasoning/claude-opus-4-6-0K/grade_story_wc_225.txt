<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exiled tutor's motivation rooted in specific guilt (princess's call) compels thread-pulling choices, with contradictory impulses (fidgeting vs. focused decoding) acting in scene; final forgiveness earned via prior micro-choices mirroring chess foresight. Interiority concrete and embodied (breath caught at trembling dropper).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via thread pulls and labyrinth clicks, culminating in on-page RR (tapestry tears, rain falls, village wakes) with felt emotional cost ("forgave the silence"); orientation anchored by para 1, no lens ambiguity. Closure image reconfigures frozen premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (frozen rain, frayed borders) constrains decoding choices and charges final image (rain falls, hush tears); sensory hush "stitched upon silence" mirrors internal guilt, evolving causally without static repetition. Micro-setting (tapestry) guides all action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode to free village/self) signaled early, tightens via Accum lens (rain trembles → falls, narrowing stillness options); agency in thread pulls forecloses guilt path with legible cost at "proved... last move on the board." One deepening suffices, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redeemable stillness emerges organically from particulars (frozen lives mirror tutor's guilt, threads winnow silence); final image (child laughs, she forgives) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns via labyrinth, hush as texture); rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short sentences at "rain shivered"), purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows), metaphors coherent/patterned ("woven hush... tear like dawn"); no loops, scaffolds, or overwriting—every line propels (e.g., "labyrinth clicked... rain trembled" causal propulsion). Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess tutor's pattern-thinking decodes time-freeze via threads/labyrinth, transforming frozen-trope into guilt-redemption arc; risk in poetic Accum lens heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from "thinks seven moves ahead."</comment>
