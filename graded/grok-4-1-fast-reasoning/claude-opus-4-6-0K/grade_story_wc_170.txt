<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterization shines in the painter's calm sacrifice—"no martyrdom... no grief"—rooted in consistent traits that compel her ongoing choices, but lacks on-page interior contradiction or micro-choices under dramatized pressure, relying on summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptions layer method, cost, and resonance toward Charged Poise closure: "she would stop humming. The prism parapet would go dark." Cost legible in "One borrowed heartbeat less," reconfiguring her presence with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective—"water still beaded along the carved stone balustrade"—prism parapet constrains her method and charges final image when it "would go dark," mirroring internal sacrifice through tactile, light-bending details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of possibilities vs. personal heartbeats tightens accumulatively to final departure, narrowing her options with "each image required... a borrowed heartbeat"; cost felt on-page without resolving, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grace in costly possibility emerges organically from mirage examples and final resonance—"seeds of what could be"—offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, lingering in children's belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward wonder; rhythmic texture modulates—"suspended moment when the town held its breath"—without head-hopping, diction controlled and biased to collective awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops, propulsion via varied rhythm; no figurative muddle, peak closure image—"faintest resonance in the stone"—crisp and charged without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-bending lullabies and heartbeat currency transforms folklore tropes; risk in conceptual premise pays off inevitably at "mirrors did not lie... show possibilities," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
