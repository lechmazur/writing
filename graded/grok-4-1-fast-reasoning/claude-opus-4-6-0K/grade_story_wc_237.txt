<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between scholarly rigidity and superstitious listening act in scene via paused quill and resumed writing; final rune success earned by embodied shedding of crystallization with scar-cost reconfiguration. Interiority concrete via "crystallized when stressed" tension rising then releasing. No therapy-speak; flaws drive micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descriptive density builds from tea-pour to shedding, culminating in on-page RR (runes pulse "like a heartbeat") with conceptual cost of scars-as-light legible in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (floating rock, storms). Single scene coherent; constraint (platform stone) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal writing (stone grain catches quill) and charges closure (rain tests tea-runes holding luminous); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hush intrusive to breathing). Lichen glow, platform sway tactile and evolved with rain. Mirrors internal hush-to-release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (transform scarring via listening) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via crystallization rise then shed-release, narrowing brittle path with visible scar-cost charging final rune pulse. Agency in quill-pauses and story-writing forecloses scholarly failure. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (damage to luminous language) emerges organically via scar-stories absorbing into stone; final rain-held runes offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting scholarly premise without moralizing. Arc inextricable from listening method; ambiguity in grandmother's "wrong" part lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (storms "like arguments," hush thickening color); rhythm modulates from compressed breath to thunder-swallowed exhale. Diction pliant under stress, reflecting shedding. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "patterns formed... fluid dynamics, but beautiful" advances release). Varied syntax propels from hush to storm; metaphors coherent (snake skin shed) without muddle in peak shedding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes rune scars, tea superstitions, storm-breath frame into inevitable transformation; bold risk in lyric accumulative rite on magnetic platform heightens stakes organically. Tropes (mentor dismissal, epiphany) transformed via tea-glow specificity.</comment>
