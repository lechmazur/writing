<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coin shatters precision belief, compelling sky portrait over faces; contradictory pursuit vs. limits acts in embodied drawing shake at sixth iteration, earning final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fractal density builds to CR closure; cost legible in "It was enough to have tried" and unreturned gaze during exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree trunk's nautilus shelves constrain timed ritual and mirror fractals; final upward gaze through hollow core charges sky motif with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time pressure tightens internal stake of precision vs. recognition; deepening at crumbled charcoal forecloses old pursuit with felt hand-limit cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fractal spirals from coin to sky drawing reweight theme of limits without statement; final image non-literally resolves with grace amid bark's closing grip.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Measurement-biased perception signatures fractals and bark; rhythmic stillness modulates to charged poise in "air inside perfectly still" hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image in spiral ascent; varied rhythm propels without loops, metaphors coherent in cloud-nested whorls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blindness fused with fractal coin transforms portrait trope; doomed library's recursion inevitability risks bold CR without gimmick.</comment>
