<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in the daydream excavation method; embodied insomnia ("restless thing that lived behind her eyes") drives micro-choices like dipping the brush. Earned change in sleep's approach feels compelled by four-night endurance, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak painting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed canvases to successful portrait via moonlight-sparked vision. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final image ("edge of sleep approach like a stranger offering something gentle") reconfigures kindness stake with felt cost of insomnia; orientation anchored early in greenhouse/moon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city constrain via fogged glass and moonlight pooling on hand, charging the painting process and final warm-glass press. Sensory hierarchy (plant breath, city cough) mirrors internal quest selectively through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing remembered kindness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as old man's face surfaces and portrait nears finish, narrowing from "every one of them was wrong" to recognition. Cost legible in insomnia endurance, but agency mostly endurance over sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of buried kindness as "second pulse" emerges organically via painting particulars and lost-language parallel, resonating in final realization without statement. Closing image reweights premise non-literally, kindness "quiet as saffron, alive as moonlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third perceptual signature in poetic biases ("light the color of old saffron"); rhythmic control modulates serene intensity. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonlight fell through the glass roof and pooled on her hand, and she felt the familiar tug"); zero loops, varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Figuratives coherent and purposeful, no overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomniac painting via moonlit daydreams and Sursilvan brush transforms kindness trope through specific excavation method. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
