<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion culminate in the "crack open in her chest during the heartbeat of a hesitation," earning the final micro-choice to place the pearl; contradictory impulses (collecting to avoid confession vs. realization) act simultaneously, with visible cost in the empty satchel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from inspection beats to shell discovery tightening density toward Charged Poise closure; on-page cost legible in "left the caves carrying nothing in her satchel for the first time in years," reconfiguring her stance without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves and glow constrain choices (shell reading, pearl placement) and charge final image ("pearl caught light and threw it outward through the etched confessions"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective integration propels momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoiding personal grief via others' hopes) signaled early, tightens via shell confessions forcing confrontation; pearl placement agency forecloses collection path with felt cost in empty satchel, though internal deepening slightly outpaces external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of turning pain luminous emerges organically from particulars (shell etchings to pearl coronation); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("dissolving the walls between hearts") reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (efficient inspection to resonant hush); rhythmic control heightens pressure in realization beat, perceptual bias consistent through glow-filtered discoveries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm propels from inspection to "small coronation"; purposeful figuratives (frozen breath, latent radiance) integrate without muddle, clarity peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector trope with seashell confessions and pearl glow feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric resonance (crystal hush to humming silence) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
