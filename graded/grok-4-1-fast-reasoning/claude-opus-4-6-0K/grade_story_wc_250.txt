<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guardian's micro-choices with mirror and lines reveal hierarchy of values under pressure of girl's arrival; interiority concrete via patient redirection of light. Girl's embodied response (tight face unclenching) earns change without speech. Final endurance of secret forecloses verbal path with relational cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density tightens from stars/mirror to shutters weaving toward girl, culminating in Charged Poise RR where star drifts between them and darkness deepens with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dock, guardian, canal). Closure cost legible in "secret... only needed to be survived."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, pooled rain, and water surface constrain light patterns and mirror use, charging final star image; sensory hierarchy (twinned lights, cooling metal) reflects Guardian's priorities. Shutter rigging integrates via action, mirroring internal calm. 9+ gate met via setting's tactical role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imparting starlight to darkness) signaled early, escalates texturally as spirals reach girl's feet, forcing her unclenching and sitting; agency in weaving forecloses coercion for silent offer. Cost unmistakable in endured secret and deepened darkness. Protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of light's patient placement emerges organically via patterns and mirror, reweighting darkness in final image ("deepened... to make room for more light") without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to empathy's power, inextricable from arc. Counter-reading plausible in "violence of being spoken aloud."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light geometries, stillwater tension); diction/rhythm modulate from calm weaving to charged drift. No elision or head-hopping; voice texture distinct and biased toward luminous redirection. 9+ rhythmic control under pressure intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with propulsion (e.g., "threading starlight... where there had been none"). Metaphors coherent (spirals uncoiling, darkness learning); rhythm varies read-aloud, accelerating in girl's response. Opening/final lines recharge motifs perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian trope via dental mirror and shutter patterns as silent therapy; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of unspoken secret. Inevitable hindsight in darkness's reconfiguration; no derivative echoes.</comment>
