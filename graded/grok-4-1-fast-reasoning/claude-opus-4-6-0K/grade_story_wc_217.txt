<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives consistent micro-choices like picking up the feather and sharing it, earning the final realization; boy's grief as secondary pressure reveals her warmly attentive trait through action. Minor slip in poem epiphany leaning toward summary rather than embodied contradiction under peak interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from feather observation to kite snap causal inciting incident, tightening through shared tending to Charged Poise closure in final affirmation ("It's still pretty"); cost legible in foreclosed easy mending, reconfiguring dawn image with emotional price on wet stones.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon's wet stones and reeds guide shore path and feather find, constraining movement; feather as recurring micro-setting charges closure image between characters. Sensory details (cobalt hush, bruised light) selectively mirror internal fracture gracefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via kite parallel forcing endurance over repair; agency in tending forecloses fixing path with felt relational cost crystallized in boy's slowed breath and coiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fracture's grace emerges organically from feather/kite parallels shifting "woven dawns" to shared grief moment; final image offers non-literal resonance reweighting incompleteness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with poetic perceptual signature (iridescent colors moving in breaks) biases toward damaged beauty; sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Look... even where it's broken"), distinguishing child's direct grief from Maren's gentle indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from rain hush to star-pulled tautness; purposeful figurative layering (kite string as gold thread) coherent, no loops or artifacts dulling closure's luminous feather image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's practice with child's loss via drake feather transforms loss trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes through iridescent specificity without gimmick.</comment>
