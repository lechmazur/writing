<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—reflex to "fold the birth certificate back into the pelican" vs. writing truth—earning final renunciation of sieving with embodied cost in bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as realizations densify to CR closure: notebook recording reconfigures mercy-to-guilt stake with legible cost ("Tempered regret settled into her bones"). Orientation anchored in para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Watch hand and terrace constrain choice (set on railing before writing) and charge final image (sea's rhythm vs. palm on notebook); sensory hierarchy reflects genealogist's precision amid dusk's dying light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (bury vs. unearth truth) signaled early tightens accumulatively via father's forgery realization, forcing agency in recording; cost unmistakable in "low, persistent kind that demands honesty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (palm on notebook, sea indifferent) offers resonant non-literal answer to sieving-hush premise, reweighting profession's mercy as decayed guilt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (history filtered as "sieved hush," "architect of quiet") with rhythmic control under reflective pressure; POV stable, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "mercy has a half-life, and hers had long since decayed"); metaphors cohere without muddle, propulsion peaks at "She simply recorded what was true and let the truth be heavy."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood portraits and "sieved hush" synthesize forgery trope into fresh genealogist arc; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
