<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rapt then afraid of Elias) act in reflective beats; final broadcast choice earned by 411-day endurance with cost in isolation. Interiority concrete via wall marks and portico trust. No safety-hedging in her stubborn vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of radio fragments and backstory builds to Charged Poise closure in broadcast and wall mark, cost legible in "four hundred and eleven days of loneliness had just become a conversation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt portico and storm constrain emotionally, scattering light during broadcast to charge final image; sensory hierarchy (blue light as ocean) reflects POV priorities. Weather pressures transmission timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (counter-prophet isolation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to broadcast amid storm narrowing allegiance options; agency in encoding/voicing forecloses passive waiting with endured loneliness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mutable allegiance vs. observable truth emerges via radio mosaic and her completion signal; final dawn image ("promise the sky was not yet sure it could keep") resonantly reweights prophetic dawn without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("static... never truly empty"); rhythmic modulation peaks in broadcast ("ribboned outward... stitches in a wound"), no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., portico geometries integrate action/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle in peak broadcast beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc prophet countered by scientific lyricism ("orbital mechanics of hope"); risk in quiet Charged Poise ending heightens stakes organically.</comment>
