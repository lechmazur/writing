<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between control and attention act in scene via leaf study and wire removal; final renunciation earned by mirrored plant/human metamorphosis with terror as felt cost. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in boot-crunch and leaf-handling under saturation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify to pattern break (vein loops), culminating in CR closure via journal line reweighting premise ("never mine to design") with conceptual cost of surrendered agency. One tightening via realization mirroring plants; no orientation debt as nursery/trellis anchors by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains opening observation and charges final image (leaf placement, roses weaving); storm-season air saturation narrows POV perception to plant immediacies. Sensory hierarchy plant-professional; evolves causally with rain cycles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (impose vs. witness order) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vein discovery deepening knowledge, foreclosing control path with terror-cost in wire removal. Agency in endurance/renunciation; cost legible in "small destruction" terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of attention-over-control emerges organically from vein-loop image shifting to journal realization; final line offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting particulars without moral. Complexity in reluctant ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in plant-vein scrutiny; rhythmic control modulates from thick-air observation to charged final poise. Lyrical compression taught early, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy observations to flowing realizations), propels via image-charged sentences. Final "mossy trellis drank" recharges opener without muddle; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plant-circuit veins offer fresh synthesis of adaptation metaphor, transforming garden trope via specific refusal of design; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically.</comment>
