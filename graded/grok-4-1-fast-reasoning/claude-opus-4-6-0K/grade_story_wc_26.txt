<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete noticing ("tremor of a hand," dusk shifts) roots motivation in consistent traits; final metamorphosis choice earned by grieving purity loss ("bright pang") against preservation drive, with embodied cost in held breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (shadow comparisons) tightens to RR closure as stone pressed to petal regathers shadow, reconfiguring archive with impurity cost legible in "scholar in her grieved."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice via petal-pages, reading glass, materialized stone enabling graft; recurring library evolution (withering branches to new bud) charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope's shadow-shape) deepens via evidence accumulation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in reversal—pressing stone forecloses purity with felt grief, charging apricot-lit action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hope's architecture emerges organically from shadow unbinding to rebinding; final bud flushes violet as non-literal resonant answer, reweighting impurity's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person perceptual signature ("dusk noticer") biases details selectively; rhythmic prose modulates tenderly under decision pressure, with diction like "luminous regret" voicing mind without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images (petal-video, smoke-shadow) with zero loops; metaphors cohere (pupa, graft) without muddle, rhythm varying read-aloud from mist shelves to apricot dusk cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh dream-petal-cloud synthesis transforms tropes (fading archive) via shadow-hope premise; risk in impurity calculus feels inevitable, petal-pressing turn grounded in Oren's footage without retreat.</comment>
