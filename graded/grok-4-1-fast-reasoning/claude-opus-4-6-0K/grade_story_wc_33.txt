<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to heal broken promises roots consistently in traits like linking absences, compelling the high-stakes bottle choice. Interiority concrete via embodied details like timing life to drone windows; micro-choices reveal values under pressure. Final endurance of his role earns closure with visible risk cost. Contradictory impulses (rule-following rebellion) act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens: arrival → family meet → uncork → crossing → departure links tighten options. Single scene anchored early (Elias/mailbag/arcade by para 2). Closure as Charged Poise RR in "Elias watched them disappear... walked south," with legible risk cost to self. Persistent timing constraint shapes tactics/final image, hitting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arcade pillars constrain choices ("Stay close to the arcade columns"); twilight cools concrete to blind drones, charging final hush. Sensory hierarchy: thermal shadows, violet flash selective via Elias's priorities. Setting evolves causally (flash → silence → deepening twilight). Micro-setting as cobalt glass filters blue, mirroring fragile promises in closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe crossing) signaled early via drone vultures/timing; uncorking tightens causally, narrowing options with Elias's agency. Moral calculus: smuggling risk vs. family need forecloses safe path. Cost visible in his isolation post-crossing ("stood alone with an empty bottle"). Escalation agency-driven under causal lens, cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending promises emerges via linking absences → fostering → final image ("a promise... began at last to mend"), reweighting acts without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures; ambiguity lingers in his ongoing risk. Resonance from particulars like folded names, non-literal closure answer hits 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited Elias POV; perceptual signature in absence-mapping, drone heat signatures. Voice texture: rhythmic modulation ("brittle hush") with stress compression at uncork. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("When I open this, you walk north"). Distinct diction under pressure, no head-hopping, rhythmic control satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "The storm exhaled. A soundless flash..." advances action/atmosphere). Rhythm varies (short peak bursts, breathing paras); no loops/artifacts, propulsion clear. Zero figurative muddle in climax; read-aloud ear perfect, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mailman maps via absences, storm bottle from drone parts transforms border trope organically. Risk in thunderstorm tech heightens stakes/coheres with world logic. Final reconfiguration (promise mends amid routine) inevitable from particulars; non-obvious angle on rebellion elevates.</comment>
