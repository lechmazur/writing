<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Proprioception as embodied curse drives contradictory impulses—bracing versus measuring release—with "two degrees" earning stasis at visible cost to prior fear posture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via repetitive beats building to charged poise closure in "two is more than one," reconfiguring mercy math with asymptotic cost legible in final proprioceptive song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest's "violet penance" mirrors internal damage, constraining walk and charging displaced shadow image; proprioceptive body as micro-setting enables precise "two degrees" measurement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy arithmetic escalates accumulatively through "yesterday one, today two degrees," agency in endurance foreclosing fear with cost of "terrible precise song" undeniable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of damage-to-beauty emerges implicitly; final "two degrees" and forest glow offer resonant repricing of mercy as approachable asymptote, reweighting repetition without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice via metrical precision ("angle of her left wrist," "micro-rotation") biases perception to body metrics under stress, stable POV with rhythmic modulation charging closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via syntax echoing proprioception, culminating in flawless "She lets it sing, and she counts, and she does not look away."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Proprioceptively enhanced" body quantifying mercy in glowing forest synthesizes trauma-healing originality; bold math framing transforms introspection into inevitable, risky closure.</comment>
