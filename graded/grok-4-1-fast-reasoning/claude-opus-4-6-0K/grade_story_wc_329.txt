<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (plays despite statues blocking fruit); final signaling choice earned by violinist traits and locust inspiration with statues' fall as cost. Interiority concrete via chest hum recognition and throat loosening. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hum-following to heart-signaling payoff in orchard's walkout (CR via final spreading image reweighting preservation vs. release, cost in toppled statues). Orientation anchored early (sky-bridges to orchard fracture). One tightening via method shift suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's silver-black bark, glowing fruit, and statues constrain choices (block fruit, freeze/crack to music); final image of branches erupting through pavement charges closure. Sensory hierarchy musical/vibrational (hum below hearing, roots groan). POV bias filters city as "too chrome" vs. orchard's "older" air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken ungoverned beauty) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed direct play to heart-rhythm deepening that forces orchard's reconfiguration. Agency in pulse-matching forecloses statues' control with visible cost (toppled wardens). Coherent pressure reweights mechanical world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (beauty as uprooted wildness) emerges organically from locust shell reprise and trees' spread; final image non-literally answers preservation question via "tarnished and wild and aching" release. No moralizing; ambiguity in city's "almost lost" listening lingers. Resonance from particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrational hums, notes from trees); rhythmic control modulates from city metronome to orchard groan. Lyrical compression taught early (hum below hearing) pays off legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/pressure (e.g., "roots shifted... groaned blossoms loose like snow"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies for ear-test peaks like statue-cracking. Zero figurative overkill in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cyberpunk city pierced by walking enchanted orchard via heart-music signals transforms stasis tropes. Risky orchard-agency heightens stakes (statues vs. roots); inevitable in hindsight from hum/locust setup. No derivative echoes; bold tarnished wonder commits fully.</comment>
