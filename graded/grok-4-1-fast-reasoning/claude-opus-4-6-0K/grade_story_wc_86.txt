<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied talisman (drawer pull turned during unbinding), with contradictory kindness/system endurance earning Sorin's pivotal response; flaws (past error) complicate without hedging, driving micro-choice hierarchy visible on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from mist-anchored opening to Charged Poise closure ("He walked into the mist"); on-page cost legible in final image of Maren alone as moon wanes, orientation instant, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist/stone constrain choreography (swallows sound, softens edges) and charge final image (Sorin into fog); recurring drawer pull as micro-setting tilts choices, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless exchange yielding wisdom) signaled early, deepens via Sorin's question forcing renunciation/stance ("Forward"); agency in unbinding/endurance tightens under lens with felt isolation cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerges organically from pull/mist particulars to resonant CR (forward despite ashes/no one), reweighting mistake-premise without moralizing; final line non-literal answer lingers with ambiguity/cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (detail-turning under stress); sparse dialogue subtextual/natural ("Where do I go?"), rhythmic control modulates hush to wind-pull cadence without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (every line propels via image/action), varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion; no loops/artifacts, purposeful poise ("jaw clenched against the valley") taught early without overwriting in peak unbinding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual exchange via talisman/wisdom recycle transforms neutral trope; risk of quiet CR ("waited for the moon to begin its waning") inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
