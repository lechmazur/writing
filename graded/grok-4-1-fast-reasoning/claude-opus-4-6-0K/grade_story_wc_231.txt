<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eccentric traits shown concretely through gap-observation and journal-keeping; final pinning of boutonniere and lighting the lamp earn stasis via inherited vigil cost, with embodied emotion in "borrowed memory settle over her."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist/memory density reconfigures stance to Charged Poise/CR in "She lit the lamp" and "Fog type: memorial. Duration: ongoing," with undeniable endurance cost; single scene/shards fit defaults, orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist constrain investigation/isolation and charge final "dock pulsed faintly," with sensory selection (iridescent planks, black water) filtered through keeper's perceptual bias; nautical twilight narrows to "bruised light" urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early deepens accumulatively via gap-observation to journal entry, narrowing to endurance with "ongoing" cost; protagonist agency in climbing/lighting crystallizes poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Borrowed memories emerge organically from particulars (Edelweiss, light for absent ships), reweighting in final image sans moral; resonant CR answers isolation/vigil question through "gorgeous, unanswerable gaps."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (clouds, gaps, mist as grief); rhythmic texture modulates from observation to charged "light turned. Mist held," purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy finals, flowing descriptives); metaphors cohere (mist as grief/occupation) without muddle, propelling to closure image; no loops, purposeful overwriting fits accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lighthouse trope via "borrowed memories" and gap-method into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens isolation stakes without gimmick.</comment>
