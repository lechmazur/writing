<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—grief for grandmother's silence versus rational evidence-based resolve—act in scene via palm on letter and planning parallels; final choice to expose via scholarship earned by career traits and discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knowledge density builds from box to folio reading to reconfiguration; CR closure in packing/stepping out reweights premise with emotional cost of bravery, legible in "ivy brushing her shoulders like a curtain parting on a new act."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy recurs to constrain quiet reflection and charge final image as "curtain parting," mirroring internal shift from buried truth to action; station dust and rosebush evolve causally with revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-rescue tightens via grandmother's suppression revelation, forcing trade-off in exposure method; cost felt in grief layering over rational plan, charging ending under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges from folio particulars to resonant CR: truth frees without erasing good, reweighting via parallels plan and bare rosebush image without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with historian's perceptual signature ("faint ridges of centuries-old paint"); voice modulates precisely from observation to charged resolve, rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ivy consume the ticket booth like a slow green tide" advances setting/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm propels to crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fictional historian uncovering personal myth via manuscript fragment transforms noble-lie trope; risk of quiet CR closure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
