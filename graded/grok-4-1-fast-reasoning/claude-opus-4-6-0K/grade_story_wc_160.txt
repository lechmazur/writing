<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in balancing love for father against 11 deaths and mother's loss, embodied in trembling hands and micro-choice to seal letter; final renunciation earned via decoding causality without tidy absolution. Slyly heartfelt trait shown through machinist lens on pressures, not labels. 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice costs visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from envelope to chain decode to revelation, culminating in CR closure where floodgates reprice father's legacy with conceptual cost of unabsolved harm. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Cost legible in "She could not absolve him. Eleven people had died."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing vents constrain emotional processing, mirroring internal pressure and charging final image as "warm breath...followed her out"; sensory hierarchy via machinist POV (pressure, shift). Micro-setting (stone seats, mist) integrates purposefully, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize forgiveness vs. harm) deepens accumulatively via decode revelation, narrowing to Charged Poise endurance; agency in analysis forecloses absolution path with felt cost of deaths. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges via floodgates as remorse-in-steel, resonant in final image sealing truths without moralizing; reweights prior surveys motif non-literally. Complexity lingers in mottled resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with machinist perceptual signature (pressure arithmetic, torque specs); rhythmic modulation peaks in decode ("links matched perfectly"). Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy decode sentences amid breathers); metaphors cohere (mist ovation, vapor embrace) without muddle or loops. Propulsion clear, no scaffolds; final line recharges motif elegantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh cipher via chain-adhesive and floodgates-as-penance transforms surveyor trope organically; quiet CR risks bold stillness, inevitable in hindsight from machinist lens. No derivatives, full premise commitment.</comment>
