<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maret's defiant artistry compels higher-stakes micro-choices like seeding poems, with interior contradiction between forgiveness and legacy protection embodied in her smile amid rule-breaking; Daveth's quiet resistance reveals flawed endurance. Final journal handover earns renunciation with relational cost legible on page. Contradictory impulses act in scene per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via seeding echoes, holds to CR closure where journal refracts truth into chorus with conceptual cost of diluted identity; orientation anchored in first paragraph (canyon, towers, spire). Backstory reflection interleaved with present cues tilts tactics; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers and pale spire constrain seeding and charge final image, with POV-biased sensory hierarchy (mist swallowing fog like lantern flame) mirroring internal states through action. Environment guides choices via bridges and walls; recurring spire reprise reweights premise per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dilute confession scar) signaled early, accumulates density via poem fragments tightening to handover reversal that forecloses solo monument with visible cost under Accumulative lens; agency in Maret's plan drives escalation. Moral calculus between erasure and sharing charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of refracted truth emerges from particulars like poem chorus dissolving single voice, with final image ("canyon that already sang with its echoes") offering resonant CR answer reweighting forgiveness premise without moralizing; subtext in silences invites ambiguity per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with artistic perceptual signature (metaphors like "iron learns the shape of an anvil"); brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You cannot erase what I did"), distinct voices. Rhythmic control modulates hush to bells; no head-hopping, elision taught via mist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with metaphors consistent (anvil hush to river stone), no loops/artifacts; syntax varies for propulsion, opening anchors stakes, final line recharges echoes. Zero scaffold in peak beats, read-aloud rhythm matches tone per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh echo-canyon premise transforms forgiveness trope via poem-seeding ingenuity; river/stone image inevitable hindsight synthesis risks bold lyric structure heightening stakes. Non-obvious moral calculus (shared scar) commits fully without retreat.</comment>
