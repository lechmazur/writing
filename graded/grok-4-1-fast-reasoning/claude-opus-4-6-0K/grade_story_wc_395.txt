<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's attentiveness drives concrete micro-choices like querying the log after the message draft, earning her final call with obsession's cost felt in isolation. Interiority embodied in "hands went cold" avoids labels. Flawless competence balanced by sensed obsession without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: recurring 7-4-1-1 density tightens to message discovery and log overwrite, delivering CR closure in "I found her" phone call with conceptual cost of deliberate silence. One pivotal deepening suffices; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive hum and patch constrain choices: patch touched "when she worked late," stared at before copying files, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (notices metadata anomalies). Micro-setting integrates via goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deleted files/Okoro truth) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to lie revelation narrowing options; agency in querying and copying forecloses silence with implied corporate cost. Pivotal message draft tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of persistent truth in fragments emerges organically via number recurrences and message, answered non-literally in archive's "held breath finally released." Final image reweights absence into presence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (millimeter-precision noticing); voice modulates rhythmically, e.g., short sentences at "hands went cold." Brief phone dialogue natural, goal-driven ("I found her").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via image/action, no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (long archive description breathes, peaks accelerate); closure image ("held breath") recharges hum motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social archive as cold-case cathedral transforms digital forensics trope; number heartbeat ingeniously drives turns from anomaly to lie without late rules. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
