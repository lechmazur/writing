<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization excels in concrete interiority and embodied motivation, with Maren's obsession driving micro-choices like keeping the urn fragment; final endurance of unresolved mysteries feels earned via prior contradiction between professional duty and deeper texture-seeking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; orientation anchors immediately in silo and role; closure via Conceptual Repricing in final image reconfigures time's meaning with legible conceptual cost of porous gaps, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo's green oxidation and urn fragment as micro-settings constrain reflection and charge final image; sensory details (warmth, weight, dusk light) selectively mirror internal texture obsession without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering capsule meaning deepens accumulatively to personal realization; one tightening via encoding messages narrows to unresolvable mysteries with felt cost of severed context.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time's unquantifiable texture emerges from particulars like urn shard and encodings; final porous gaps image offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature (time's feel over measure); rhythmic modulation builds density toward closure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (minute like warm glass) integrated into propulsion; minor texture repetition patterned around time motif, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh Numerics Accord premise and garage-sale encodings transform time trope ingeniously; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
