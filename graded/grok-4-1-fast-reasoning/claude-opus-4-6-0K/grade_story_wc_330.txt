<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's traits shown through patient inspection and embodied singing ("rough and unpracticed, a low hum that cracked"); final voice-use earns change with prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries accumulate to Charged Poise closure in singing/halo-pocketing; cost legible in "throat seemed to have stored like grain against winter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Misting hush and spring constrain perception, charging halo's "faint gleam" in workshop; selective sensory details mirror internal silence without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discoveries to singing agency; cost felt in unpracticed release narrowing prior endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet's depth emerges via particulars; final "desert kept its luminous secret" offers resonant reweighting of wrong turn/silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with carpenter-specific perceptual signature ("marks of a file, the intention of a hand"); lyrical rhythm modulates patiently to crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("rainwater fills a dry channel"); no loops or artifacts, sensory propulsion integrates action seamlessly in peak singing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent artisan discovering voice in circus relics; halo/angels transform abandonment trope into inevitable personal reclamation.</comment>
