<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of grief and exhilaration embodied in geode-pressing and math pursuit; final work-return earns stasis confronting survivor flaw with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from math hints to coordinate capture; CR closure lands in "mapping reservoirs of quiet" with conceptual cost reweighting destruction's dominance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's cooldown cycles and geode constrain recalibration choices; violet crystals charge final image, mirroring internal reservoirs through astrophysicist POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cooldown timer tightens stake via hand-logging under Accumulative lens; data-save forecloses grief-processing path, with cost felt in "bleak exhilaration" endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode-crystal motif shifts from trauma echo to restraint proof, offering resonant answer to violence inevitability without moralizing; reweights wedding memory via math particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fuses "pressure wave" trauma with perturbation precision; rhythmic modulation peaks in "cascaded numbers," stable close third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in math cascade; "crystals burned violet" propels closure image without figurative muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perturbation hunt synthesizing drone grief and cosmic pools feels inevitable; risks poetic-science fusion heightening stakes uniquely.</comment>
