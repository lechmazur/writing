<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in petal hope versus pragmatic counting act in scene; mirror arrangement earns final endurance with cost of bare bush felt in hands-on soil work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as petal drop and parental reflection density-build to charged poise closure; final glittering alley image reconfigures tending with impermanence cost legible in bare roots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moonlight and fire escape constrain mirror angling choice; recurring rosebush roots and alley moss charge final seeds image, filtering through gardener's precise bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Petal drop tightens internal stake of loss to mirror endurance; hush cadence deepens pressure, foreclosing bloom pretense with on-page cost in stripped soil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final mirror-scattered seeds offer non-literal answer to precision-opening motif; reweights parental inheritance without moral, embracing loss complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature on light ridges and tidal rhythms stable in single POV; modulates seamlessly under hush pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in oar-rhythm propulsion; metaphors like "moon’s reflection...a door" cohere sparsely through peak mirror beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Junk mirrors into light-garden transforms loss trope via heirloom precision; quiet poise risks lyric synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
