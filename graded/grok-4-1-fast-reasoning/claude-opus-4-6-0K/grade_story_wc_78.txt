<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of grief and building act simultaneously as she strikes wreckage while cataloguing tones; final shift from prediction to composition earned by prior micro-choices with embodied cost in molars-felt octaves. Interiority particular via mallet from pelican femur and cloud scripture. No safety-hedging; flaws in isolation drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of spirals, strikes, hums builds to Charged Poise closure where she chooses a chord branch, reconfiguring prediction into composition with cost of infinite paths foreclosed in "restless euphony." Orientation anchored by ~50 words in orchard/raft/blue hour. One tightening via unprecedented cloud nautilus pays off on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Raft driftwood, brine-lapped roots, and xylophone mallet constrain choices, turning into tones that charge final vibrating trunk image. Sensory hierarchy musical/tactile (pitches in molars, fruit shivering); selective via prophet bias. Evolves causally as orchard hums with strikes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival via music from loss) signaled early, tightens texturally as fractal harmonics breed and clouds tighten, forcing agency in dubbing/direction choice; cost legible in "refusing to let loss be final" paid via endless branching narrowed to one arrow. Tide shift tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wreckage-to-instrument emerges implicitly via dubbed obstacles and fractal scales; final "orchard sailed on, humming" reweights premise non-literally, charging prior grief with restless refusal. Complexity in never-peaceful aliveness avoids tidy moral. Recurring resonance motif constrains closure without tokenism.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in tonal nomenclature ("Foundation," "Tide Voice") and fractal syntax mirroring mind. Rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to accelerating strikes under pressure. No elision; diction biased to atmospheric scripture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "struck the longest driftwood beam... dubbed it the Foundation"); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaks in "fractured into infinite branches." No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalypse prophet turning raft into fractal instrument via bone mallet; risk in musical causality heightens stakes organically. Nautilus clouds-to-chord arrow inevitable from established patterns, transforming survival tropes via specificity.</comment>
