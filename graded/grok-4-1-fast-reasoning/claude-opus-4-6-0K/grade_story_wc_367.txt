<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in laughter at storms' absurdity/terror, embodied in pulsing stone and light in teeth; final joy earned via ritual endurance with cost of perpetual madness. Micro-choices like tearing out LED reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from climb to storm peak and Charged Poise closure in final laugh/trim/wait; cost legible in "always a next storm" foreclosing normalcy. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald stone pulses under palms, constraining climb/ritual and charging final constellation image; sensory hierarchy (boots ringing, wick vibrating in teeth) reflects Maren's prophetic attunement. Setting evolves with storm, mirroring internal poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steer fractured world) signaled early, deepens texturally via beam's shadows reaching minds; storm peak forces stance crystallization with cost of isolation/endless vigilance felt in joyous laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared reality via shadows/laughter emerges organically from ritual particulars; final image ("steering light into a world that had forgotten") reweights premise without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (light "remembers," shadows "folded into geometry") biases toward prophetic; rhythmic control modulates from ascent propulsion to peak vibration without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fragile as a promise" advances character/world); minor figurative density in ritual beat controlled by voice, no loops; propulsion matches scene via varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of refraction physics/prophecy transforms tropes (lone lighthouse keeper) into deliberate world-steering; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via wick's shadows.</comment>
