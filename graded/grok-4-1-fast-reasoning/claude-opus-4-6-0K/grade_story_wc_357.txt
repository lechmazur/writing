<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in failed orchards and competent micro-choices like water navigation and bark touch; interiority concrete via hum in ribs. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+ test; endurance feels competent without raw flaw exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of flight, inversion, echoes funnels to CR closure in final paragraphs where Maren reprices resilience via tree/arrow, with felt cost of internalized frequency over extraction. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via inversion discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches and water flow constrain navigation and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (hum in teeth, whirling silence) reflects pilot bias. Vine growth integrates setting into action; 9+ test met via arches enabling/pressure during inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source) signaled early, deepens via inversion/echoes convergence to tree touch; agency in following water and reaching out narrows to realization. Escalation accumulative with felt cost in non-extraction shift, but stakes lean existential over visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from arrow-embedded tree and Maren's failed hands; final image ("growing around it") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Arrow shifts meaning from violence to incorporation, charging CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (water currents as thermals, echoes as wood creak); rhythmic diction modulates from navigational precision to lyric silence. No elision issues; voice texture distinct and pressure-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer senses/action without loops; rhythm varies for inversion peak. Minor figurative density in echoes description purposeful, not muddled; no scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating orchards, gravity inversion, echo chorus transforms sci-fi tropes into resilience metaphor; arrow/tree inevitability risks bold world logic without gimmick. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
