<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sable's diligently curious trait drives concrete micro-choices like narrating aloud and decoding the hopscotch, with embodied excitement ("laughed at her own excitement") revealing internal consistency. Final endurance of isolation feels earned via prior causality, foreclosing fear without tidy resolution. Contradictory impulses (fear forgotten by curiosity) act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlings → phrasebook → hopscotch build density to Charged Poise closure in pinning the chart and watching trapped light, reconfiguring isolation with conceptual cost ("patient, luminous, and as stranded as she was"). Orientation anchored early (airship over valley). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Airship details (patched silk envelope, brass barometer) and hopscotch board constrain choices (mooring limits movement; deck enables decoding) and charge final image (light trap parallels her state). Sensory hierarchy reflects cartographer's priorities (thermal readings, coordinates). 9+ test met via constraint and closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery) signaled early, tightens via phrasebook/hopscotch decoding that narrows options under Accumulative lens (density reweights isolation). Agency in noting patterns forecloses routine charting with felt cost (time/isolation). Escalation driven by her choices, cost legible in final parallel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sociable isolation emerges organically from particulars (narrating to ship, starlings' patterns, trapped light), with final image offering resonant reconfiguration ("not quite alone") without moralizing. Recurring light motif shifts from theory to lived parallel. 9+ test: non-literal answer reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's eye: "folding and unfolding... like ink dropped into moving water"). Rhythmic prose modulates with excitement; no head-hopping or elision issues. 9+ test: signature and control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("ribbons of ten thousand, folding and unfolding"); no loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle. Propulsion aligns with scene (accelerates in decoding). 9+ test: zero issues, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of starlings as light-map via hopscotch/phrasebook transforms isolation trope; risk in linguistic bird patterns pays off at closure. Non-obvious angle feels inevitable. 9+ test: synthesis and risk heighten stakes.</comment>
