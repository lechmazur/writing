<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in her disguise as fool enabling info-gathering while she stitches urgently; final chart completion earned by sustained adjacency method with physical cost in aching knees. Interiority concrete via thread-as-connection perception. No safety-hedging in her quiet subversion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds via stitching adjacencies to Charged Poise closure in chart reveal and descent plan, with 12-day cost legible in "tied off the last synchronizing stitch." Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Eternal candle constrains stitching choice and charges final image as she holds chart to flame; autumn wind and dome's "vast ear" echo mirror her listening, evolving with sync action. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific to embroiderer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map coup) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sync revealing "Twelve days"; agency in micro-choices forecloses coup path with felt urgency cost. Persistent constraint of overlooked status shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unseen power in overlooked listeners emerges from stitching particulars; final image of glittering oblivious city reweights conspiracy premise non-literally with her prevention's conceptual cost. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in silence-as-listening and threads-as-galaxies; rhythmic control heightens under sync pressure, diction biased to Maren's craft. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., candle description advances myth, light, glow); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or artifacts in peak sync beat. Strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as conspiracy-mapping transforms spy trope via adjacency logic; risk in quiet embroiderer heroism inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
