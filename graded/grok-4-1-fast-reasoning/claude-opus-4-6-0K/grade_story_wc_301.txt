<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion post-meds drive micro-choices like handling bellows and copying graffiti; final journal entry feels earned via prior contradictions between methodical documentation and raw feeling. Minor therapy-speak in "numbness had become its own sickness" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early anchors (Maren, Platform 2, Sallow River by ~100 words); closure as Conceptual Repricing in final journal line reconfigures self-forgiveness with felt cost of rawness. Graffiti beat tightens via pattern break, paying off disorientation waiver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy curtain parted by hands, wheezing bellows air) filtered through chronicler's bias constrain choices (e.g., parting ivy to access bathroom) and charge final iris/river image. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent from platform to bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness signaled early via meds and chronicling; accumulative escalation deepens through graffiti realization, narrowing to iris sighting with agency in persistent observation. Cost legible in "painfully alive" rawness embracing foreclosed numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as unapologetic flow emerges organically from river/images without moralizing; graffiti and iris provide resonant non-literal answer reweighting documentation as solace. Minor Thematic Echo risk in graffiti line slightly overt, but anonymous and anchored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (textured world, map notations); rhythmic control modulates from measured to lyrical at iris. No head-hopping or filter excess; voice reflects chronicler's precision amid rawness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm; opening simile sets ear test positively, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in reflective beats ("colors throbbed") risks slight overwrites but supports textural lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler off-meds seeking forgiveness via overgrown station/river transforms epiphany trope through specific objects (bellows, graffiti) and map motif. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
