<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in profession culminate in earned reversal where Elias receives rest after decades of giving it; "inadvertently stubborn" trait forces pivotal dive choice with visible weariness cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (throw away vs. charter boat). Final endurance/renunciation feels inevitable under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from package hum to library revitalization; on-page RR (Charged Poise) lands in lens placement and Elias's settling weariness, with legible conceptual cost in "true stillness, unchased at last." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impossible architecture and bioluminescent tablets constrain dive and charge final refracted light image; sensory details (subsonic hum in molars, warm still water) filter through undertaker's rest bias. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (granting permanent rest) signaled early and deepens via ruins discovery to lens placement under Accumulative lens; agency in chartering dive and aligning cracks forecloses disposal path with weariness trade-off cost legible in final settling. One tightening reweights knowledge/options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rest as earned reciprocity emerges organically from lens hum to "light...finally has a place to land," reweighting prior motifs without moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity in "unchased" quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (undertaker's "geography of final rest," hum in molars); voice modulates rhythm from clinical to lyric under pressure, diction purposeful and biased. No dialogue; experimental compression of ruins legible and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion syncing scene (short sentences in descent, breathing in closure); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (pressure "exhaled"). Zero scaffold obscures cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Fresnel lens distress and undertaker's rest vocation transforms Lovecraftian city trope via stubborn dive agency; risk in impossible geometry heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
