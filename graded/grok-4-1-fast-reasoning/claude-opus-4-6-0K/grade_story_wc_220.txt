<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via body-reading aversion yielding to cylinder interpretation, culminating in earned recognition of mother's voice that forecloses isolation with emotional cost. Leaf-touching reveals hierarchy of values under survival pressure. Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cylinder layers build density to CR closure ("She rewound the cylinder and listened to her mother's voice again"), reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost of bridged absence. Orientation anchored early in Groovetown. No shards needed; one tightening via confession suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cylinders as micro-setting constrain choices (rigged player) and charge final image; wasteland fissures ("cracked earth," "fissures running for miles") mirror internal cracks, filtering through bloodhound POV. Sensory hush and wax textures purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake signaled early tightens texturally via cache success to personal deepening; revelation forecloses interpretive detachment with felt relational cost. Agency in patient decoding under council pressure; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of distance-to-closeness emerges implicitly from leaf/cylinder parallels, reweighted non-literally in final listen without moralizing. Particulars (Sol/Soledad, wax preservation) yield resonance; ending image answers via charged stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (scene-reading from bones to grooves); rhythmic control modulates reflective hush to charged silence. Diction wasteland-idiosyncratic ("phonograph cylinders etched with spiraling grooves"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "wild hush that filled her shelter like weather"); metaphors coherent ("light through stained glass"). No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; rhythm varies naturally to closure hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound intuition to cylinder decryption transforms post-apoc tropes; mother-daughter twist inevitable from leaf setup. Risk in wax messages heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
