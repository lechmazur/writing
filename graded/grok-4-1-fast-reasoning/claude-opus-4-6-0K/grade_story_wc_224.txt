<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in burying gift "like a key beneath a hearthstone" reveals contradictory fear/resonance impulses; final choice to gaze earns change with years-lost cost, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via glyph-triggered memory to translation density; CR closure in reflection vision reweights talent/home with undeniable past-buried cost, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stone's feather-texture and collapsed stairs constrain discovery/translation choices; final polished surface reflection charges CR image, mirroring hollowed mountain/internality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant buried-talent stake signaled early deepens accumulatively through months-long translation narrowing avoidance option; resonance realization forecloses fear-path with felt years-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of home/shape emerges implicitly via architectural syllables; final vision offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral, charged by feather-grain motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in texture/grain noticing biases details character-specifically; diction/rhythm modulate from alien syllables to flared eyes without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in "forests with grammar for roots, oceans conjugating"; propulsion varies rhythmically, no overwriting in peak reflection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer reading time's feather-grain transforms trope; mountain-as-sentence risk heightens stakes/coherence, inevitable in hindsight via glyph priming.</comment>
