<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction peaks when no vision arrives, her spine unprickled earlier, compelling the plea "Teach me" with identity cost. Embodied reactions like teeth-aching chord reveal character under pressure. Final renunciation of prophecy earned by failed reading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising dissonant music and shadows to CR closure: Maren's present-seeing pearl image reweights her prophetic lens with identity loss cost. Single scene oriented early via cave entrance. No orientation debt; pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Musical crystals and Mirror Pool constrain reading ritual and charge pearl's final glow. Sensory hierarchy (harmonic vibrations, bright darkness) reflects Maren's perceptual shift. Setting evolves from prophetic tool to present revealer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful reading) deepens via vision failure and shadow pulse, narrowing to present-magnification realization under Accumulative lens. Agency in pearl grasp and whisper forecloses prophetic path with felt cost. Escalation coherent without causal force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary sacred emerges via pearl's layered nacre showing dripping water, not future, reweighting prophecy premise organically. Shadows and music shift from prophetic to present lens without statement. Final image answers via non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (cave as instrument/home) modulates to stressed dissonance. Dialogue subtextual: pilgrim's request unveils limits. Rhythmic prose matches crystal harmonics, distinct idiom in brief exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense, varied rhythm propels via image integration (stalactites chiming); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (bright darkness) purposeful, pattern-taught early. Minor density in metaphors fits lyric Accumulative texture without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh oracle undone by mundane request transforms prophecy trope via cave's autonomous forces. Bold Accumulative CR on everyday magic risks poetic compression successfully. Pilgrim's angle inevitable from opening cave song frame.</comment>
