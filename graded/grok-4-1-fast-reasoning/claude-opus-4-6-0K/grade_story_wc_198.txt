<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Delphine's motivation roots in grandmother's code, embodied in trembling endurance and micro-choices like widening silences; contradictory impulses surface in prophecy's press vs. her hush. Interiority concrete via breath and instrument warmth. Final renunciation earned with inheritance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from mist ribbons to thickened fog/voices, cadence shift in dimming prism and dissolving words yields Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "trembling" and "quiet weight...still hers." Anchors by para 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto/prism constrains sight/play (can't see hands) and charges final dewdrop image; mist evolves causally, narrowing to breath-void. Sensory hierarchy (light fracture, wept numbers) POV-biased to prophecy hush. Micro-setting (saxophone) tactile in beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled para 1; tightening via thicker mist/echoed voice forces harder play, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in endurance forecloses utterance; cost in bodily tremble and daily inheritance alters no tactics but charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of utterance vs. invested silence emerges via mist dissolution and final whisper, reweighting inheritance without moral. Subtext in unmaking notes; resonant CR in "catastrophe still sleeping" answers prophecy's push.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (negative space, erasure tones); rhythmic diction modulates to urgency ("played harder, not louder"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early, legible at hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "breath shaping silences"); varied rhythm accelerates in climax, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (mist ribbons → auroras → white), coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: saxophone unmaking prophecy-code via negative space transforms silence trope organically. Risky lyric hush heightens eerie stakes; inevitable in hindsight from ritual beats.</comment>
