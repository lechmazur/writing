<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied emotion and micro-choices, like borrowing personalities as research data points; contradictory impulses in metabolizing identities fuel her stubborn endurance. Final realization—"felt her own sorrow arrive from the outside"—earns change with visible cost of aloneness. No diagnostic labels; flaws like furious isolation complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via accelerating star vanishings tightening her print-empathy deadline; closure as Charged Poise/CR in continued work racing "encroaching silence," cost legible in "furiously alone" image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards, single scene coherent. Cost proof: final lines reconfigure her self-perception with undeniable darkness pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Topaz workbench and halo fragment constrain choices (dimming light forces speed) and charge final image; stars as live deadline evolve causally, mirroring internal loss. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: inks "with no names," press sound "like a bell struck underwater." Micro-setting (press, fragment) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve empathy's scale before stars collapse reference) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via faster vanishings forcing cadence shift in printing; agency in disorienting sequence forecloses isolation path with felt cost. Pivotal tightening: printed page transposes her sorrow, narrowing to endurance. Price unmistakable in "racing the encroaching silence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's transposition amid cosmic subtraction emerges organically via ambiguity method and star backdrop; final image reweights premise—work as futile-yet-vital resistance—with non-literal resonance, no moralizing. Counter-reading (clarity/chaos equivalence) lingers plausibly. Halo fragment callbacks recharge without token motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: mathematical lens frames emotion as "combinatorial logic" and "emotional prime factors." Rhythmic modulation peaks in printing beat; purposeful compression taught early via type blocks. Distinct diction reflects her cryptic expertise without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "surgeon dislocates a joint") without muddle, rhythm varies for propulsion—"sky was losing its stars one by one" hooks, final line crystallizes. Syntax embodies lucid turbulence under pressure. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: printing transposed empathy via letterpress/ halo against vanishing stars transforms tropes (cosmic deadline, alchemy) into inevitable emotional calculus. Risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes; no derivatives, bold premise fully committed.</comment>
