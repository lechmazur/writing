<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic Maren shows contradictory impulses in deliberate tile-stepping defiance and skeptical transcription; final double-pulse realization earned by decoding causality, with weeping as embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density from palm-press memory to archive revelation; CR closure lands in "double-pulse... hands clasped," with tile/notebooks as persistent constraint charging image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heart-tile constrains kneeling/transcription choices and charges final palm-press; whales' "exhalations catching light like brief, silent bells" mirrors internal migration, filtering via Maren's math bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skepticism stake deepens accumulatively through cipher realization to vulnerability archive; agency in "began to transcribe" forces empathetic reconfiguration, cost in "wept... opens rather than closes."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories reweight premise from metaphysics to "empathy made deliberate"; final clasped-hands image resonantly answers central question of magic vs. patterned kindness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with math-perceptual signature in "combinatorial substitutions rotating through the square's symmetries"; rhythm modulates wind percussion to stars' "sharp and indifferent" poise under reflection pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in "tessellated... pristine" anchoring; "wept in the way that opens rather than closes" propels embodied peak without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magic square as "key... to attention itself" ingeniously synthesizes math-mysticism into empathy archive; whale symphony inevitability heightens stakes in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
