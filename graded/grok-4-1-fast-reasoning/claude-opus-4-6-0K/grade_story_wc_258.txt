<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to reverse-engineer belief via card mappings feels rooted in consistent traits, with her initial dismissal of the tape as theater evolving into empirical embrace; contradictory impulses act in her logging despite unsettling implications. Jules applies pressure as reluctant friend, forcing micro-choice to show maps. Final endurance of mapping forecloses magical interpretation with felt cost in the "unsettling" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo mapping to Jules' confession triggering map display, culminating in CR closure via final tape measurement ("Between The Star and The Fool: nine centimeters") that reconfigures inheritance as empirical record with conceptual cost of human patterns' inevitability. Orientation anchors early (loft in Marais post-crash). One tightening via confession deepens collective stake without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring tape and onyx cards constrain choices (measuring gaps) and charge final image; rain-sounds/shadows mirror internal patterns, narrowing perception selectively through Maren's data-biased lens. Sensory hierarchy fits cartomancer priorities (ink absorbing light, faded tape numbers). Loft micro-setting guides spatial action coherently, evolving with intensified rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping post-crash patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Jules' confession forcing map reveal that narrows from individual to collective geometry. Agency in endurance of project despite "unsettling" cost; one deepening reweights options under Textural lens. Moral calculus emerges in interrupting patterns vs rebuilding trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belief as reverse-engineerable patterns emerges organically from mappings and Jules' spiral-tracing moment, with final image ("adding another thread to the web") offering non-literal resonant answer to crypto-era anxiety without moralizing. Subtext in silences (her corrections) and irony (algorithms to cards). Complexity lingers in empirical unease.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: data-vis tarot fusion in noticing ("grief had a recurring interval of eleven centimeters"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("That's not a confession... That's the pattern"), advancing plot; rhythmic modulation heightens under pressure. No head-hopping, elision purposeful in inheritance cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture (e.g., "onyx-ink notations" multitasks world/character). Varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (tide/markets, beads/trajectories). Final line recharges motifs cleanly; read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot-as-data-vis post-crypto crash transforms tropes (fortune-teller, inheritance) via tape measurements and pattern spirals; risk in empirical mysticism feels inevitable. No echoes, bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
