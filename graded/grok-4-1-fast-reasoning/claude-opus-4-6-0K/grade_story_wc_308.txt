<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Seren's motivation to map the pulse through resonance is embodied in micro-choices like appraising the arrowhead and reading bird patterns, revealing patient endurance with centuries of implied struggle. Interiority stays concrete and sonic-specific, avoiding epiphanies. Final alignment earns her stasis without tidy resolution, foreclosing physical movement with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from echoes to constructive interference, culminating in CR closure: "She had not moved, and she had arrived everywhere," with legible cost in dusted knees and patience. Orientation anchors early via canyon and skimming. Single scene holds without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and echo-pools constrain skimming choices via acoustics, charging final mapping image; birds' spirals enable low-frequency read. Sensory hierarchy favors sound, filtered through Seren's harmonic bias. Dust under knees evolves tactilely, mirroring internal arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find pulse) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bird appraisal to arrowhead cast, narrowing to body-felt resonance. Agency in precise flick forces alignment; cost of decades felt in sternum thrum and dust layers. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over motion emerges via interference patterns, reweighted in final gyre and dust stir: non-literal answer to navigation via listening. Subtext in bone "fingers" and wandering will invites ambiguity without morals. Particulars like obsidian tone drive earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature fixates on harmonics ("whisper became a chorus"), with rhythmic syntax modulating to inhabited thrum. No head-hopping or elision; compression taught via echoes pays in closure. Voice biases to sonic idiom, stable under revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density layers jobs (e.g., "dust that settled in rings like...trees" advances setting/motif); varied rhythm breathes with casts. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; arrowhead kiss propels cleanly to pulse. Closure image sharpened without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Harmonic skimming premise synthesizes acoustics and bones into fresh cartography; bird patterns transform environmental reading ingeniously. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens sonic stakes, inevitable in pulse alignment. No templates; voice commits to sonic originality.</comment>
