<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Esoteric realist traits motivate concrete actions like knot vocabulary and structure-building; interiority particular without labels. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, tilting toward declaration over dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from assembly to waiting; moth wing's night rotation delivers Charged Poise CR, reweighting signal's purpose with impermanence cost legible in "the cadence hung suspended."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's mist-fed moss and updraft constrain structure and charge wing's turn; sensory details (pale light, ferns curling) mirror internal reverence, evolving with dimming light. Recurring ferns and moss anchor final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to signal monarch's interrupted path signaled early, tightens via no-arrival deepening that forces endurance; cost felt in transient rooting and wing's subtle animation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence theme emerges from knots, wing, and no butterfly, resonant in final watch without moralizing; reweights overlooked histories via wing's turn as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with biased noticing (blushing stillness, cathedral-veined wing); rhythmic syntax modulates from deliberate assembly to hushed vigil, perceptual signature distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; no loops, purposeful lyric figuration like "healing bruise" integrates without muddle, read-aloud ear strong in peak night beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh esoteric realist premise transforms loss into knot-language signals; wing from mill synthesizes forgotten labor with monarch, inevitable in hindsight via transient structures.</comment>
