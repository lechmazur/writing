<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the vision of self-sacrifice versus survival, earning the final stone placement with embodied cost; interiority particular via eel patterns and promise as "second heartbeat." Flawless under pressure, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build from eels to rocks to aurora-bent light, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "she placed the final stone" with her petrification cost legible in prior vision. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal bluff's slippery rock constrains footing ("bare feet braced against rock she could barely grip"); aurora and "borrowed dawn" evolve causally, charging final image across skin. Micro-setting (painted rocks, star dust) forces mathematical sequences pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore friction via promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vision revealing personal cost, narrowing to endurance choice; agency in final placement forecloses survival with on-page price felt in "turned to stone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred patterns as rewriteable rhythm emerges via eels/rock spirals, resolved non-literally in Maren's stasis as "final painted rock," reweighting promise and friction without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (counting eel spirals, aurora as "bruised gold"); rhythmic prose modulates from observation to peak intensity at hand on dust, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (each line advances pattern/pressure); metaphors coherent ("friction dissolving like salt in warm water"), rhythm varies for propulsion; zero loops, no figurative muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, eel patterns, mathematical rocks, and star-dust sacrifice feels inevitable; bold premise fully committed, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
