<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's reversal as vocation drives all choices, embodied in gear-stained fingers tracing the stone and counter-clockwise gear mounting. Contradictory impulses subtle but earned in rejected clocks versus intimate catastrophe smile. Final endurance to dawn seals change with cost of convention's dismissal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: yoyo reverse-engineering accumulates to gear installation and light eruption as Charged Poise RR. Closure cost legible in tide swallowing stone while light persists counter-clockwise. Orientation anchored by arrival at low tide; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse stones weeping salt, Fresnel lens as cathedral constrain mounting and charge final beam arc. Clockmaker POV filters gears and tidal rhythm purposefully. Hunger stone mirrors internal reversal, evolving with tide to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking latent reversal tightens at "last gear clicked" into light eruption, narrowing to her persistence. Agency in rigged chain-pull forecloses forward fate with bleak exhilaration cost. Accumulative density reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reversal unspools truer path emerges implicitly via rejected clocks to persistent light. Final "building" image reconfigures premise without moral, lingering ambiguity of catastrophe intimacy. No tidy resolution; complexity in fate's assumption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: mechanisms as radiant energy. Voice rhythm modulates from poised arrival to exhilarating beam sweep. Prose texture distinct in "unspool time itself."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from yoyo mapping to dawn vigil; no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent like "spring wound backward," enhancing without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm peaks at light's "cold and white and absolutely bleak."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker reversing lighthouse via yoyo gears transforms time/tide tropes organically. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes to inevitable "breathe light into a world that had forgotten it." No derivatives; bold premise integrity.</comment>
