<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied solemnity in draping mirrors and verse-writing under projections; motivation rooted in revolutionary past compels patient reimagining with earned endurance cost in final acceptance. Contradictory impulses (past rallying vs. present elegy) act in scene. Solo POV limits relational crucible but delivers particular flaws driving isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from storm prep to shard projections to CR closure in "proof that creation persists," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of her defunct status. Orientation anchored early in chamber/asteroid. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and time-light constrain choices (mirrors covered for coherent projections) and charge final image of amber gilding. Sensory hierarchy via Maren's priorities (mineral arabesques echo theory). Details integrated into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering shard) signaled early, tightens via coherent projections revealing mourning, forcing endurance with cost of irrelevance legible in final poise. Accumulative escalation via density reweights options. Agency in method and attention forecloses external validation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent creation emerges from shard's arc and her verses, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting human longing as latecomer. Subtext in "stubborn insistence that these beings had mattered." Avoids morals via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with poetic perceptual signature ("chronological currents manifested as amber light"); rhythmic control modulates from solemn prep to charged viewing. No dialogue or head-hopping; elision of past taught early, paid in present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; figurative language patterned to baroque motif without muddle ("braiding together like the hair of some ancient god"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation fits voice but borders overwriting in descriptive peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, pre-human baroque habitat transforms sci-fi tropes via lived isolation and poetic proof. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; closure recharges asteroid premise organically.</comment>
