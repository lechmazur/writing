<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scavenge survival vs. reclaim ambition) act in fragment collection and ghost offering; final negotiation earned by causal buildup of personal story-fragments with visible cost in timeline reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragment density builds to ghost encounter; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in "ghost...turned it once...Film advancing. A small, resolute click" with conceptual cost of reshuffled ambitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon's "fractured stillness" and "cloud-salt" constrain edge-walking and ghost approach, charging final image; recurring carousel base/stones mirror internal erosion purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truce with ghost-self) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragments to wheel-offering confrontation; cost legible in ghost's click forcing "what's worth wanting now."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions theme emerges via story-fragments; ghost's wheel-turn offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting timeline premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("time folded...shuffling a deck of cards in the dark"); rhythmic diction modulates fractured lyricism to resolute closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in lines like "small kinetic pulses traveling outward"; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or overwriting, passing ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal story-scavenging in cloud-lagoon transforms ghost-confrontation trope; risk-taking in purposeful time-folding heightens stakes organically to inevitable reshuffle.</comment>
