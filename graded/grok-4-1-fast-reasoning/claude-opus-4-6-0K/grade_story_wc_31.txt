<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation rooted in vow compels descent and search, with interior contradiction between silence and luminous promise embodied in final weep. Hiding behind truth constrains early choices without safety-hedging. Final micro-choice to press key tag earns renunciation of isolation with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as lantern density builds to porthole epiphany and book discovery; single scene oriented early at pier/harbor. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in weeping with named color, cost legible in "circuit closed" after years' vow. No orientation debt; pattern pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library's warped shelves and brine constrain wandering search; low tide enables descent as pivotal choice-shaper. Lantern light through porthole charges final image, mirroring synesthesia. Sensory hierarchy (salt/paper, shifting hues) reflects lamplighter bias, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find color/sound) signaled via vow, tightens texturally via lantern epiphany narrowing to book grasp. Agency in purposeful wandering forecloses unfulfilled promise; cost unmistakable in wept closure. Pressure coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of synesthetic vows emerges implicitly from particulars, reweighted in porthole hum where light "seems to hum." Final image offers resonant answer via book/key, charging synesthesia without moralizing. Complexity lingers in grief's cost amid beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (luminous promises, hiding via truth). Prose texture modulates rhythmically from dusk silence to weeping cadence. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to lamplighter's observed silences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short pier descent, flowing lantern river). No loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (lanterns as "drifting fire," cello amber). Propulsion peaks in porthole without overwriting, clarity intact at closure weep.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic library quest transforms lamplighter trope via shipwreck vow; fresh angle on grief as hidden luminescence. Risky quiet lyric closure inevitable from early lanterns; no derivative echoes, bold in emotional specificity.</comment>
