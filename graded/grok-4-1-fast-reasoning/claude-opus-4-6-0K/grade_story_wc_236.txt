<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory grief and emerging patience act simultaneously in her object-reading; final endurance of loss as "enough" earned by prior micro-choices like freeing the float. Interiority particular via anosmia's "frosted glass."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of clock residues builds to CR closure in final image of hands on workbench, reweighting loss with conceptual cost of acceptance legible in "trembling calm."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog and copper basin constrain discoveries, charge final occluded reveal; water drips tactilely mirror internal shift, no white-room—shop lived-in via siphons and patina.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection tightens accumulatively via screw discovery narrowing grief options; Sera beat forces interpretive agency, cost felt in renunciation of old scents.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of veiled miracles emerges via particulars like screw's glow; final basin vibration reconfigures premise non-literally, no moralizing—resonates through fog's thinning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature via scent-loss bias; dialogue sparse but subtextual in "Someone was born near this clock," rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, no loops—fog metaphors cohere (weeping glass); propulsion via varied syntax peaks in "drop by measured drop," minor long-sentence breath in reflection uncharged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water clocks as emotional palimpsests, birthing screw turn inevitable from shop logic; risks lyric reflection paying off in CR without gimmick.</comment>
