<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's luminous skepticism manifests in concrete hesitation before sliding the ring onto Dahl's tongue, earning her realization; contradictory doubt and inquiry drive micro-choices with visible cost in resolved flavors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from tastes and aurora to CR closure in "every flavor...resolved into one...like homecoming," with legible conceptual cost of skepticism yielding; orientation anchored early at bluff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora grazing lavender and fog off Dahl's shoulders constrain convergence choice and charge final image of tangling lights/forest walk; sensory hierarchy (taste dominant) filters through Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove theory tightens accumulatively via Dahl's arrival and ring test narrowing doubt; agency in tasting peaks with flavor convergence forcing stance reconfiguration and felt resolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry-as-answer emerges organically from tastes converging into "homecoming," reweighting premise without moralizing; final forest walk offers resonant non-literal response to weather-carrier question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with taste-perceptual signature ("tasting copper...north"); dialogue subtextual ("taste what happens") advances stakes; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("ozone...snow and salt"); no loops/artifacts, varied syntax breathes with accumulative intensity; minor figurative density purposeful in peak tastes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-as-metabolism, tasting directions, voting forests transforms sci-fi into personal inquiry; ring-upward point and flavor resolution feel inevitable from established rules.</comment>
