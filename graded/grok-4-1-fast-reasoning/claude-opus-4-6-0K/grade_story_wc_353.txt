<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with symphonic mindset embodied in carving and crack-reading; final weeping earns change from sharpened listener to translator. Contradictory impulses (silence as rest vs. enemy) act in scene. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from carving to crack discovery to strum, with Charged Poise closure in the pulse "she felt in her sternum." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via cracks suffices. Cost legible in leaf shiver and hedgehog pause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Siskin alders and stress cracks constrain choices, charge final image; touch-hierarchy (fingertips tracing bark) reflects urgency. Micro-setting (rooted cradle) guides strum. Sensory selection purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via insulator cradle and crack intervals to strum; agency in building forecloses doubt-path with sternum-cost. One deepening changes knowledge of silence. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of translating grief emerges implicitly via cracks as "world's grief made visible"; final "silence was the first movement" reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical texture ("intervals. Fifths, thirds") stable in single POV; perceptual bias toward harmonics selective. Rhythm modulates to climax pulse without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak strum beat. Propulsion peaks in "pulse she felt in her sternum," zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent apocalypse via tree-cracks as music; cracks-to-insulator risks bold, inevitable in hindsight. No template tropes; transforms quiet into symphony start.</comment>
