<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied "weight tugging at her sternum" and micro-choices like silencing chant to let chapel speak; final laugh as "serious kind of playfulness" earns defiant renunciation with visible cost of free display.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Conceptual Repricing in mosaic message; orientation anchored in first line; closure costs legible in "stubborn, glittering refusal" reconfiguring hopelessness, charged by carrying fire out as "sentence she intended to finish."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent lichen, jasmine grief-sweetness) filters through fireworks designer's priorities; rag knot and open dome constrain light/ignition choices and charge final updraft image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hopelessness gravity) signaled early, deepens via mosaic's pattern break narrowing surrender option; agency in free-display decision forecloses quitting with felt cost of using leftovers, reweighting blank sky canvas.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of defiant burning emerges organically from mosaic particulars ("THE SKY IS WHAT YOU MAKE WHEN YOU REFUSE TO STOP BURNING"); final image non-literally answers without moralizing, recharging prior motifs with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (hiss/smell of reactions, chrysanthemum bursts); rhythmic modulation peaks in chant resumption; diction reflects designer's hands-on math of fuses/timing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative integration ("fortress bloomed like something that had forgotten how to die" mirrors defiance); varied rhythm propels without loops; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war fireworks designer seeking mosaic dare transforms ruin tropes; designer-to-designer note offers non-obvious defiance angle, risking lyric texture that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
