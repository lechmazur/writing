<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientist/priestess doubt) act vividly in pivotal seed-waking beat, earning final endurance with embodied cost; internal voice specific and flawed without hedging. Micro-choices like holding seed to ear reveal values under time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream patterns build density to seed-hum closure (CR via transcribed song amid looming monsoon), with legible cost in "handwriting shaking" and inevitable rains; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge bloom and seed constrain choices (climb before rain, tactile waking), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (luminous light, felt hum) POV-filtered, evolves with clouds building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save memories) signaled early, tightens via dream interpretation to agency-driven waking under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in monsoon horizon forcing trade-off, foreclosing loss path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of doubt vs. preservation emerges organically from seed-song success reweighting "luminous doubt"; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing, complexity in enduring ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("luminous doubt that was her constant companion"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in waking beat, diction biased to empirical whimsy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "vibration that traveled through her bones and became... melody"); propulsion peaks in shaking handwriting line, varied rhythm supports Accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical magic via dream-seeds transforms tropes; risk in "luminous doubt" voice inevitable at hindsight closure, no derivative echoes.</comment>
