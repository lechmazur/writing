<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's ardent pattern-noticing and job-love root her decisive radio broadcast, with interiority concrete in "clarity that felt less like revelation and more like remembering"; final remembrance as sole bearer of truth earns her change with felt isolation cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in-scene prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of pattern realizations culminating in synchronized voices and consolidated starlight as CR closure, with cost in Maren's solitary memory; orientation anchors by para 2, single scene coherent. Hourglass refraction perfectly charges the merger beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's phosphorescence and still water mirror infinite timelines, constraining radio tactic and charging final fog fade; POV-filtered details like "constellation patterns in the commuters' faces" integrate selectively. Recurring starlight evolution pays off closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timeline slip tightens accumulatively via pattern realization and radio sync, driven by Maren's agency; cost legible in her eternal remembering amid passengers' amnesia. Radio voices layer pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of permanence in transience emerges organically from ferry routines and merged seams, reweighted in final "permanent fixture on a transient vessel"; resonant without moralizing. Hourglass shadows offer non-literal answer to pattern question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Maren-specific perceptual bias (patterns in faces/water); rhythmic prose modulates from warm routine to syncopated voices under stress. No head-hopping, diction controlled and biased to her worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring timeline bleed (e.g., "layered beneath the noise"); no loops, purposeful lyricism in "clocks ticking sideways" without overwriting in peak sync beat. Read-aloud rhythm pulses with phosphorescence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of commuter routine as timeline seams, transformed via deckhand's pattern-vision; risk in radio-self-merge heightens stakes organically. Hourglass as retirement joke ingeniously reconfigures into merger tool.</comment>
