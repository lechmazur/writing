<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to collect wall stories roots consistently in her sensitivity, compelling endurance with solitude cost; interiority concrete via wall-pressing and dust smells, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as diary density deepens dreamless premise, yielding CR closure in final wall-listen and eastward walk where crooked axis turns with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's resonant acoustics constrain Maren's listening purpose and charge final outer-wall press; sensory details like "bronze quiet" and "hollow bone" filter through her perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to preserve stories escalates via Elspeth's prophecy revelation, tightening to defiant endurance; cost legible in persistent motion against "dreamless walked...stopped."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Displaced axis motif emerges organically from tapestry/diaries to reweight dream-loss prophecy, resonating in Maren's witness-role without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with auditory-biased perceptual signature ("muttering of walls"); rhythmic diction like "bronze quiet that settled over everything" modulates intensity seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("tweezers...pale light") with propulsion; zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figures like "seismic wave" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wall-hearing in dreamless silo synthesizes prophecy and persistence into inevitable CR; risks quiet lyricism heightening stakes via perceptual originality.</comment>
