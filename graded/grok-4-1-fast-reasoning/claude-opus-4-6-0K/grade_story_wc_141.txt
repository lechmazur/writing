<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (myth buster chasing irrational lead) act vividly in scene via cello-playing choice under fading pressure; final renunciation of pure debunking earned by causal buildup of recovered memories with embodied cost ("crying and grinning simultaneously"). Interiority concrete and particular, no stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of resonant memories tightens to Charged Poise/CR closure ("voice thinned to a whisper, then to silence. The shell cooled"), reconfiguring stance with felt cost; orientation anchored early (cliff path, observatory), single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring objects (seashell, cello) constrain choices (propped against mount, held to wood) and charge final image (shell to bruised sky); sensory details selective/POV-biased (hollow cello sound, ashen light), atmosphere mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover/decode mother's riddle) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening hums narrowing timeframe/options; agency in retelling/playing forecloses resolution path with on-page cost (aching fingers, shell silence), charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (searching as truth over solving) emerges organically from particulars, final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("No fixed north. No answer. Just the searching") reweighting premise without moralizing; subtext in shell's "ephemeral" truths lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (myth-busting lens on wonder: "killing wonder"); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short sentences in peak: "The cello sang. The shell hummed."), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "played until her fingers ached, coaxing each memory out"); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, purposeful figures (rain on wedding day) enhance without muddle; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting arc with resonant objects transforms tropes (shell as memory tech, unfinished cello); risk in lyric closure ("some riddles are not solved but lived") heightens inevitability, no derivatives.</comment>
