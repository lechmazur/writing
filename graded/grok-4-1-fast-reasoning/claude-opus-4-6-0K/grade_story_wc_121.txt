<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory selves (coward, tyrant, child) act simultaneously during convergence, folding into wholeness with earned cost of grounding; interiority particular via "hovering bones" under pressure. Final landing reveals hierarchy of values, embracing gravity despite eternal float. Minor abstract "labyrinth of self" label slightly generic but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via rune presses collapsing timelines to CR closure ("Gravity held"), with cost in tablet crumbling and embraced weight. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Maren above viaduct, rain drops). Narrow drop-ripple window tightens single scene without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and puddle constrain rune activation and inward fall, charging final "fading glow" image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to drop under crisis, POV-biased via floating defiance. Details evolve causally: light climbs then dims with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collapse timelines) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shuddering corridors and screaming labyrinth, forcing inward fall with agency in rune sequence. Cost legible in "tablet crumbled" and grounded steps foreclosing float. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fractured self-to-wholeness emerges via converging selves and landing image reweighting defiance premise without moral; ambiguity lingers in waiting eternity. Resonance from particulars like rune timestamps, no direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in quantum instants and light textures; rhythmic syntax modulates from suspended poise to heavy steps. Voice reflects floating mind contracting to grounded. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/pressure, e.g., "darkening brightness" purposeful without muddle. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; final "brightness darkened to dawn" resolves image. Read-aloud cadence perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural labyrinth, timestamp runes, drop-ripple physics transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in fantasy logic (floating inward) heightens stakes organically. No derivatives, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
