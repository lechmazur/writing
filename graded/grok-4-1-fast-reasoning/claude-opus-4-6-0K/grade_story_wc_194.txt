<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to CR closure in "Voss name would begin its long unraveling," reweighting silence with conceptual dynastic cost; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sepia room's convergence point and crank handle constrain intuitive listening and charge final golden light image, filtering through Elara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
