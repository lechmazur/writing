<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of stoic sensitivity act in scene (feels ache of crozier illusion without flinching) and propel earned final realization; motivation rooted in destiny interruption intensifies via crozier choice with embodied cost (tears at bloom).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: approximations accumulate to crozier unmaking, yielding CR closure (nexus blooms) with conceptual cost (destiny's instrument destroyed); orientation anchored immediately in nexus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains transmutation attempts and charges final image (embers rekindle as living bloom); sensory details (frozen flowers, suspended fires) selective via alchemist bias, evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify via destruction to break destiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through approximations to penny-drop tightening; agency in crucible nudge forecloses failure path with legible emotional cost (hopelessness transmuted).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility from annihilation emerges via particulars (failures as subtractions); final image (nexus bloom) offers resonant CR answer reweighting prior "almosts" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical gaze on near-things); rhythmic diction modulates from leaden hopelessness to blooming possibility, heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "molten meaning shuddered"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (frozen flowers to living bloom) in peak beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical failure and symbolic destiny-breaking (crozier-to-bloom); risk in poetic compression pays off, transforming tropes via nexus logic without gimmickry.</comment>
