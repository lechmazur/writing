<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through textures like "Tuesdays heavier than Wednesdays"; motivation intensifies via professional hedge-maze expertise to temporal puzzle, earning final camera renunciation with cost of lost proofs. Contradictory drive to return despite warnings acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fading photos, retrocognition, halo discovery builds to CR closure where boundary disintegrates, cost in photo abandonment legible at "She set down her camera." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via fragment restores image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's root-bridges and hyperbolic saddles constrain traversal and charge final unfurling; recurring mist, ravine constrain choices tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (sternum hum, fibrous time) biases via designer's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to grasp time's texture deepens accumulatively via photo loss to future-self reveal, forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable in present-erasing integration, agency in fragment press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinths as self-traps emerges organically via garden's temporal folding; final root-time image reweights premise without moral, lingering ambiguity of gratitude's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (geometric textures, pigment breath) modulates rhythmically; purposeful compression of eras pays off legibly at closure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "bridges curving into geometries that should not have fit"); minor figurative stack in peak ("color hemorrhaged... unfurled like a flower") borders muddle but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Astronomical halo in arboreal time-fold synthesizes fresh via designer's lens; risk of nonlinear reverie heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
