<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and contradictory impulses shown in fixation on clock ("luminous ache") versus laughter post-quake; final renunciation of isolation earned by prior struggle, with embodied cost in descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: texture builds via clock's spin, earthquake cadence shift tightens to CR closure ("she understood, finally"); cost legible in open-dome rebuild and mountain descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory and clock constrain choices (can't fix, persistence amid ruin) and charge final image; sensory details (cracks "like veins of lightning") selective, POV-filtered by lens obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness ephemeral vs. let go) signaled early, deepens via quake tightening options; agency in realization forecloses stasis path with cost (ruined observatory, life reconfiguration).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from clock/ephemeral images, final descent offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting capture obsession without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/motion metaphors); rhythmic modulation heightens quake intensity without head-hopping.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short quake sentences propel); metaphors coherent and purposeful, no loops—e.g., "minute hand... rotating in a continuous, frictionless blur" anchors propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repairer isolation, unfixable clock, quake epiphany transforms stasis trope; risk in lyric style heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
