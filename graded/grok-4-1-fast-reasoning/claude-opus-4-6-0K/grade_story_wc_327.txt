<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storyteller's motivation to translate via texture is embodied in copper veins humming with stories, driving micro-choices like pressing the diamond; curse creates contradiction between dream-hearing and waking silence, earned in final bodily absorption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vein hum to canyon speaking, CR closure in "language had not died... waiting for the next storyteller" with cost of vibration encoded in skin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers' textures constrain choices by producing tones when scratched; recurring diamond and birds charge final silence where birds settle, mirroring internal archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive language) signaled early, escalates via diamond tones herded by birds into transformed echoes; agency in drawing across bones narrows to bodily cost in glowing veins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of language as mutable medium emerges via texture-to-sound translation; final image of veins as "living archive" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-reading ("read with her fingertips"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive buildup to charged closure hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (veins as "tributaries," bone as "architecture of extinction") coherent across peak; no loops, propulsion peaks in "canyon itself seemed to be speaking."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mineral-veins, cursed diamond acoustics, bird murmuration revives dead language via bone echoes; bold world-logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
