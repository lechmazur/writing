<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: guardedness compels high-stakes confessions that release frozen grief, embodied in "taste of failure thick on her tongue" and micro-choices like thrusting the seed; final renunciation of openness earned with visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via serenity amid wading deeper. No safety-hedging; flaws drive resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: confession density feeds seed germination, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as vine seals funnel and orchard stills; cost legible in "breathed out the last of her confessions." Single scene coherent, orientation instant ("village," "water's edge"). Closure unit pristine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details constrain choices: "cold as accusation" thighs propel inward spiral, phosphorescent apples and groaning bark charge vortex immersion; final "congregation after prayer" image mirrors internal release. Body as micro-setting (waist-deep thrust) evolves causally, biasing druid priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal vortex) signaled early, escalates via lens-driven deepening: failed sigils → inward circles/confessions narrow options, forcing trade-off of personal grief; agency in seed-thrust forecloses guarded path with on-page cost. Protagonist alteration charges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-as-medicine emerges organically from particulars: vortex as "mirror" hoarding grief reweighted by confessions feeding vine, final image ("found the lost thing... inside her chest") offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Counter-readings in appetite's ambiguity linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: druidic bias in "land whispered its confession to her feet," rhythmic modulation under stress ("warlike serenity... armor made of breath"). Compression purposeful, eliding backstory via cues that tilt present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts: every line propels (e.g., sigils "shatter like glass" into widened vortex); rhythm varies for immersion, metaphors coherent (wound/appetite). Closure image crystalline, read-aloud propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-fed carnivorous seed transforms druid trope via inward spirals, inevitable hindsight payoff in unbinding orchard; risks bold inward causality over external magic, heightening personal stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
