<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (fingers folding paper slips), motivation to transpose life intensifies via prophetic returns like her own fortune washing back, earning final embedding choice with cost of releasing covert past; contradictory endurance of spycraft habit shown in opening canister moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cookie microdots to bottle fortunes, one tightening when own fortune returns, CR closure in embedding microdots ("pressed one into the period") reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of open secrets persisting; orientation anchored early in lighthouse climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (Puget Sound currents, basalt fist island) constrains choices (studies circulation like dead-drops, directs bottles), charges final image (beam across dark water, spiral descent); sensory selective via POV (tidal joke).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transpose via directing fortunes/flow) signaled early, deepens accumulatively when fortunes prove true repeatedly and own slips back, forcing stance crystallization in canister opening; cost legible in "familiar enigma" endurance, agency in embedding/setting bottles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets/prophecy as directed flow emerges organically from particulars (cookie periods, bottle currents), final image ("tide pulling her words toward strangers who would crack them open and believe") offers resonant CR repricing without moral; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers in hope's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (compressing futures into words, constellations in specs); rhythmic prose modulates contemplatively ("mechanism for directing flow"); purposeful compression of backstory shards legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (every line advances texture/stakes), varied rhythm accelerates in realizations ("prophecy was never hers"); no loops/artifacts, opening line anchors voice, final seals cadence; purposeful metaphors build without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy microdots in prophetic cookies/bottles transposes to oracle via lighthouse; risk in nested secrets (sub hulls in hope predictions) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from "open secrets" premise.</comment>
