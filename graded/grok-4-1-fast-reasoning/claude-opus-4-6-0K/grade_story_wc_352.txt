<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait enables wheel solution via seven readings of coils, rooting motivation in consistent vigilance that compels high-stakes alignment under time pressure; embodied emotions peak in sternum pressure; earned discovery forecloses complacency with visible time cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of patterns (doodle to grotto coils to wheel) tightening to chamber exhale; on-page CR closure via manuscripts spilling with 19-minute cost legible in final grab-and-read; orientation anchored early at grotto mouth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inverted mist pooling as ceiling lake and peripheral wall luminescence constrain choices (crampons, sidelong glances); POV filters via prism-mind refracting light; wheel as micro-setting charges alignment climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve hidden knowledge) signaled via doodle map and treatise; agency-driven tightening in wheel turn narrows options amid countdown; cost unmistakable in 19 minutes to escape sealing grotto.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vigilance theme emerges organically from margin patterns and reversal thresholds, culminating in resonant CR where new doodles reweight discovery as perpetual maps; final light flare answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in refracted light metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates from coiled descent to flared recognition; purposeful compression in inversion beats heightens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (mist sentient, stones drifting) with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere (heartbeat light to stoked fire) charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted physics and doodle-encoded libraries transforms ancient secrets trope via prism-mind and threshold logic; risk in peripheral luminescence pays off in vigilant recognition.</comment>
