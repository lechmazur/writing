<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's subtle confidence and career-rooted motivation compel micro-choices like using the phrasebook and drafting the memo, with embodied calm under the falcon's arrival pressure. Internal conflict subtle but present in envying the falcon's instinct versus her evidence-based work. Final drawing choice earned by lifelong quest, foreclosing doubt with felt storm cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: falcon return accumulates to phrasebook match, condensation pattern tightens to drawing onset as Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "storm, maybe twelve hours out" and final tranquility image reconfiguring ambition. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake and rusted outpost constrain via weather-reading (condensation clears, signaling drop), charging final transparent glass view. Sensory hierarchy cartographic: moisture patterns reveal pressure shifts mirroring stakes. Micro-setting (glass, falcon perch) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping singular source) signaled early, tightens via phrasebook confirmation and 12-hour storm window narrowing options. Agency in memo-drafting and ink line tests commitment; cost felt in expedition herald amid worrying tranquility. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of evidence vs. instinct/rivers transcending politics emerges via particulars like "rivers remember" flourish and falcon envy. Final ink-drying image reweights quest as charged poise, resonant without moralizing. Subtext in dog-eared page and condensation subtly mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cartographer's perceptual signature: gravity/rivers idiom, precise observation. Rhythmic prose modulates from calm exposition to intensified final image; no elision issues. Voice distinct in lines like "gravity, it turned out, had a sense of humor."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., falcon talons "scraping rust into the still air" advances setting/action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Final "first line of ink dried" image clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic quest for "singular convergence" transforms mapping trope via indigenous name and falcon signal. Risk in quiet, Accumulative closure heightens personal stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from phrasebook dog-ear to atlas blank space.</comment>
