<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—career as debunker vs. mounting doubt—and final witness choice earned by orchard observations with worldview cost; interiority concrete via "tremor of doubt" and embodied palm pressure from diamond.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build to stillpoint CR where diamond placement reconfigures meaning, with conceptual cost legible in "comfortable lie... shattered" notebook moment; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard micro-setting constrains via dust column stillpoint and storm bypass, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (silver bark, bruise fruit, ochre storms) reflects POV bias, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to stillpoint realization narrowing debunking path; agency in diamond placement and notebook writing forecloses prior stance with felt career cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. mechanism emerges organically via orchard proofs and diamond light; final notebook image offers resonant CR repricing "world... fully explained" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of precise observation (e.g., "paper grain and... handwriting"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in stillpoint beat, diction matches debunker lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; no loops, strong verbs (e.g., "light... accumulating"); figurative control peaks clean in "small, patient star" charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of debunker arc and stillpoint premise transforms tropes organically; diamond compass and orchard resilience offer non-obvious angle, risk-taking in CR closure heightens stakes.</comment>
