<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with meteor empathy ("burn so brightly precisely because you were disintegrating") embodying contradictory fragility/brilliance; final endurance of attentiveness earned via prior micro-choices like devoted recording, foreclosing transfer with isolation cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (mundane sweeping vs. reverent tracing). No unearned epiphanies; flaws in solitude drive growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine sweeping to meteor empathy to recording uptick, culminating in Charged Poise RR at final bolide through yellow glass reconfiguring vigilance as strength; cost legible in enduring silence ("remain soft in a hard silence"). Orientation anchored early (station, Maren, era). One tightening via empathy suffices; closure on-page with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains choices (pauses sweeping inside meridian) and charges final image (green shadows painting walls); volcanic dust, ash plains selectively mirror vulnerability via tactile maintenance. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (seismographs as chanting). Details evolve causally, guiding attentiveness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength via vulnerability) signaled early, escalates texturally from routine to empathy/deepening recordings to final stance crystallization; agency in endurance/attention forecloses escape with felt isolation cost. One decisive density shift at bolide narrows to radiant strength. Pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (brilliance as fragility's consequence) emerges organically from particulars like meteor surrender and glass meridian, reweighted non-literally in final bolide image confronting "fragile spine"; no moralizing, invites ambiguity in attentiveness's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonance from conflict, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (manuals as sutras, stars as threads); rhythmic control modulates from quiet hush to flourishing expansion, heightening pressure lyrically. Prose texture character-specific (dust as gray prayer shawl). No head-hopping; diction biased to spiritual curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances resonance (e.g., "trembling gold meridian"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (meteor "surrendered its mass"). Zero scaffold; read-aloud ear perfect, specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of overlooked outpost solitude into phenomenological astronomy via janitor's reverent maintenance; yellow glass/meteor tracing transforms trope of isolation into "oldest, most radiant strength." Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes coherently; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
