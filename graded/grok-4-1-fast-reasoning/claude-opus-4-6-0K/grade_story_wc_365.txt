<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory-specific interiority and embodied impulses culminate in the redirect choice, where mapped sensations foreclose overlap catastrophe with felt cost of isolation; cyclically spontaneous trait constrains reliably without labels. Minor external behavior lacks deeper contradiction, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: sensory density builds to convergence crisis then Charged Poise closure via coordinates image, reweighting search with undeniable cost in "heavy enough to reshape every map"; orientation anchored by para 2, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring bay/overlay and body-as-tool (fingertips, soles) constrain redirect and charge final mapping image; selective sensory hierarchy (ghost vibrations to solder smell) reflects cartographer bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (father's truth) signaled para 3 tightens texturally via shard pulse to convergence pressure, forcing agency in redirect that forecloses disaster with legible cost of cycle ebb and solitude; one decisive deepening suffices flawlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mapping unseen weaves emerges organically via sensory cartography motif shifting from ghost bays to solid coordinates, offering resonant non-literal answer in final charting image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listened with her skin," "taste on the back of her tongue") biases noticing toward sensory data; rhythmic compression heightens under stress, stable close-third POV with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propulsion via varied syntax and textural specificity (e.g., "thermal signatures of mechanics whose hands had long since turned to dust"); zero loops/artifacts, flawless read-aloud rhythm even in peak convergence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory cartography transforms parallel worlds trope into fresh, embodied weave with irreplaceable shard mechanics; risk-taking in textural overlays heightens stakes organically to inevitable coordinate payoff.</comment>
