<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grounded craft contradicts dream-loss, embodied in sternum hum during breathing; final endurance of boundary-erasure earned via prior micro-choices like sextant retrieval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fog/breathing density reconfigures waking-dreaming distance to zero; closure CR lands in mirror manifestation with self-dissolution cost felt in "boundary...erased itself."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-as-lung and twilight frost constrain ritual choice, charging final warm mirror; selective sensory hierarchy (visible pulses, sternum vibration) reflects mirror-maker bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to recapture dream tightens via breathing agency, foreclosing chase with boundary-cost; density cadence under Accum lens reweights options in sextant hum to mirror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirror as threshold reconfigures maker/made premise through fog synchronization; final breathing mountains answer "runaway" question with non-literal self-cost resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with threshold-perceptual signature ("mirror...not a reflection but a threshold"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "frost clung to branches...glitter"); zero loops, varied openings propel to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes fog-crystallization and sextant into inevitable glass-mountains premise; risk of breath-ritual heightens stakes organically.</comment>
