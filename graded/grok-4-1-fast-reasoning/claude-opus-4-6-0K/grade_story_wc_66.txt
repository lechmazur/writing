<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via grandmother's embers and dust motif, with contradictory diligence/rebellion driving micro-choices like score gaps; final endurance earned by letters' proof and luminous reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments layer to CR closure—"Maren opened her mouth, and from somewhere inside the approved melody, an old world stirred"—with conceptual cost of signal vs. mist legible on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember alcove/mist constrains broadcast (wool-muffled mic, fog-choked), charging final thinning for signal; sensory hierarchy (chill creeps, amber pulses) mirrors calm rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast fragments) tightens texturally via letters' deepening and new score gaps; cost felt in contraband case-lining and mist pressure on poised opening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories-from-dust emerges via lyric fragments reweighting famine premise; final stirring image offers resonant answer without moralizing, embracing quiet ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in luminous/ember diction, rhythmic control modulates to charged poise; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "dial's amber light to warm"); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (dust breathing), no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story-famine world with lyric-piracy transforming rebellion trope; risk of quiet telling heightens stakes, inevitable in dust-to-worlds arc.</comment>
