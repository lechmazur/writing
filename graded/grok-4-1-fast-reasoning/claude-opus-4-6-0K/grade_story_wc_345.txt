<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collective characterization strong in Pascal's cracked voice naming Maren and Tuva's "brambled hope," rooting motivation in traits like altruism; earned change via trust grown "root by root." Limited individual interior contradictions, but scope fits ensemble under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages accumulate from warnings ("THE EASTERN ARCH IS CRACKING") to blueprints, tightening to harvest closure (Charged Poise in "WELL DONE" on central arch) with cost of Maren's unseen body and ghostly service legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain choices (seedlings moved before collapse) and charge final image (chalk on cathedral ceiling, butterflies through arch); sensory hierarchy vivid via nectar-dripping orchards under lavender sky, filtered through settlers' survival bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival to thriving) signaled early via crash, escalates accumulatively through message density to collective orchestration; one tightening (warnings to blueprints) narrows options with trade-off of doubt dissolved "like sugar in rain," cost felt in grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of brambled hope emerges organically from chalk-trust arc and harvest image reweighting loss into ripening fruit; resonant non-literal answer in butterflies carrying light upward, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Collective third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in orchard-root metaphors; voice rhythmic and biased toward growth imagery, modulating from tightness to spiral release; minimal dialogue (Pascal's line) natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("roots threading stone like stitches") woven into action; no loops, varied rhythm accelerates from crash grief to harvest poise, minor figurative density in openings fits taught lyric pattern without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-via-chalk on sideways orchards transforms tropes into fresh synthesis (altruistic dead weaving colony-organism); risk of poetic sci-fi pays off in inevitable "WELL DONE" hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
