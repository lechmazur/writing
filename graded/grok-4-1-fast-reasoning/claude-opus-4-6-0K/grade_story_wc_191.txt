<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent as lore keeper preserving history; micro-choices like peeling paint layers embody "wisely adventurous" trait under time pressure. Interiority concrete via trembling fingers and archive humming. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but endurance earns closure without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: waterfall entry → paint peeling → ruby flake → stairs emerge → climb evades sunrise. Orientation anchored early at cliff edge. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with legible cost in risked license evaded by ascent into memory-light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent fruits illuminate ruby, paint layers constrain discovery method, waterfall pressures entry. Mural and stairs charge final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Sable's priorities, evolving causally with actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve lore via stairs before sunrise) signaled early, tightens via ruby activation narrowing options. Protagonist agency drives causal escalation; time pressure forces trade-off with visible cost in paling sky during climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of history's burial vs. preservation emerges organically from peeling layers and final unclaimed-yet-known throne. Resonant non-literal answer in closing image reweights erasure threat without moralizing. Complexity lingers in throne's enduring emptiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: archive singing, ozone-pollen breath. Rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to transcendent. No dialogue; voice fuses sci-fi lyricism with character bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "light that felt like memory"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors during peel but coherent, no loops or artifacts dulling closure ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lore archive, paint-palimpsest history, and ascension stairs transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric closure heightens stakes via "future remembering the past"; inevitable in hindsight from early codex setup.</comment>
