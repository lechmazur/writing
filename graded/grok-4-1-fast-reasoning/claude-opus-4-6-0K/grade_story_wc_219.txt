<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—scientific reduction vs. felt excess—act in scene via monitoring and realization; final belief earned by pilgrimage causality with deepened ache as cost. Luminous skeptic traits shown through papers and warm doubt, embodied in cortisol spike exceeding data.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of path convergence, tower climb, amber light builds to CR closure where "knowing the mechanism did not diminish the ache. It deepened it" reconfigures reductive premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early; single-shard scene tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower and amber constrain choices (climb to sill, forehead to glass) and charge final image; sensory details (chalk dust, dripping angel, golden eye) selective via skeptical POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test homecoming chemistry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when data matches but "something exceeded"; agency in measured pilgrimage forecloses mechanical view with felt deepening cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of amber fly offers resonant non-literal answer to mechanism-vs-mystery question, reweighting alien signal and homecoming parallels without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars like footprints and cortisol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (scientific warmth: "cascade of oxytocin, cortisol"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "ivy latticed the lower windows. Rain had left the limestone clean but streaked"); rhythm varies naturally, propulsion perfect through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact trigger for scientific homecoming test, transformed via amber fly pilgrim; risk of lyric reflection heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
