<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via precise logging warring with sentiment (crossed-out parallel); final endurance of method earned by brother's backstory causality with embodied cost in wary persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from wreck history to snow globe image; CR closure in sediment tilt reconfigures containment premise with legible patience cost at "Steady, steady, steady."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library's "swollen...soft geometry" and snow globe constrain analytic choices, charging final image; micro-setting filters through POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding letting-go signaled in Earhart trigger; textural deepening via transcripts/objects forecloses evasion, though abstract "physics" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Everything sealed eventually admits the world" emerges implicitly from ship settling/snow globe crack; final image reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in granular object-noting matches analytic POV; rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity without distance slips or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("pulp sculptures") propels without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm supports textural accumulation to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow globe in wreck library transforms disappearance tropes into "signal into patience" via analytic grief; lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
