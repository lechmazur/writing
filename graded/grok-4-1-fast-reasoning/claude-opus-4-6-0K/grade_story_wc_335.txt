<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly when Fen walks backwards and stops at Maren's daughter revelation, compelling his shift from retreat to engagement; Maren's combative tenderness earns Fen's final choice with relational cost. Backstory anchors present via shard cue, tilting stance without drag. Flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from arrival to tea reading, landing Charged Poise closure in Fen's pen-to-paper act with felt cost of carrying exile's lessons; orientation anchors in first paragraph. One tightening via gap in leaves narrows return options. Cost legible in "go back fuller" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library shards and tea leaves constrain choices through reflection/annotation; swing outside charges final image, mirroring Fen's drift to stillness/action. Sensory details (dust, footsteps, iron-black tea) filter via Maren's archivist bias. Playground evolution ties hush to decision pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversal via understanding) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shard/tea rituals forcing fuller return; agency in Fen's cup-touch and pen-grab forecloses hollow path with on-page cost. No reversal needed; cadence shift reweights under lens. Minor abstractness in explanation slightly mutes peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-as-return emerges implicitly from shards/tea geometry/swing, reweighted non-literally in Fen writing forward without moral state. Subtext in combative tenderness layers ambiguity. Final image answers home question with conceptual cost of exile's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Maren's geometric perceptual signature; dialogue natural/subtextual (Fen’s "undo it," Maren's edge-held warmth). Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate footsteps to hush. Voice distinction clear in idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "walking backwards when nervous" embeds trait/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figuratives (ribs, acute angle) integrate without muddle. Read-aloud ear excels in tea-reading beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shard-archivist/tea geometry transforms exile trope into resonant return calculus; risk in quiet poise closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars like leaf-gap. No derivatives; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
