<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation roots deeply in her poetic weaver identity and scarred devotion to the plate, culminating in earned closure via the final whisper "We reached it," which reveals subtle partnership with her mother's legacy. Contradictory optimism under risk acts in her stitches and exit despite rising tide. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like blind defiance of precedents compound realistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density from entry grooves to innermost chamber sewing, with on-page Charged Poise closure: tapestry hung high as tide rises, reconfiguring labyrinth from ruin to cathedral with felt tidal cost. Orientation anchors immediately in tide pools and canyon. Single continuous scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Red walls "like wounds freshly opened" and sleepwalker grooves constrain pathfinding and timing, evolving causally with lantern glow and rising water to charge final lullaby image. Sensory hierarchy (mineral scent, glistening stone) filters via Maren's priorities; no white-room—tactile, lived-in choreography throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping sleepwalker paths against precedents) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to innermost chamber climax with tide as live cost foreclosing lingering. Agency in tracing/sewing narrows options; moral calculus of risk vs. reverence visible in optimistic stitches under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ruin-to-reverence emerges organically from grooves, sewing, and final water "sang... like a lullaby that had finally remembered its words," reweighting sleepwalkers' inheritance without statement. Orchid solace motif shifts from fragile carvings to hopeful closure image. Complexity lingers in council's potential rejection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice matches poetic weaver POV with distinct perceptual signature—metaphors like "scar... shaped like a crescent" and "stitches... hauntingly optimistic" modulate rhythmically under tide pressure. Stable third-person limited; purposeful poetic compression taught early, pays off in charged final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "sea pulled back its fingers") without muddle or loops; rhythm breathes with scene, accelerating to "last stitch as the first trickle... crept." Zero scaffold; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sleepwalker grooves as map transforms labyrinth trope into fresh, inevitable synthesis, with sewing plate into ancient wall as bold, irreplaceable risk heightening reverence stakes. No derivative echoes; particulars like tide-timed whispers feel memorably organic.</comment>
