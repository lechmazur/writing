<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dren's motivation to preserve knowledge is concrete and intensifies via embodied actions like scraping strata and holding the cog; internal conflict emerges in patient refusal against Sera's threat. Minor slip in overt philosophizing ("only philosophy worth living underground for") borders on unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure refusal. Voice distinct from Sera's in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wall readings and cog evidence builds to Charged Poise closure in final image of silence as "one narrative beginning to erode," with conceptual cost of isolation threat legible ("They'll seal the access shafts"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via Sera's demand/refusal narrows options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sewer walls as micro-setting constrain Dren's preservation method and charge final image via "sedimentary layers" metaphor; sensory details (splashing boots, lantern arcs on cog) filtered through his priorities. Sunken ruins pressure choices by supplying irreplaceable records. No generic placeholders; vivid, purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve empirical records vs. council myth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cog challenge and sealing threat, forcing endurance with felt cost in Sera's quiet fracture. Agency in refusal/endurance forecloses easy compliance. One deepening sufficient; pressure coheres to closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from walls vs. manuscript, cog as evidence, culminating in resonant final image of erosion without moralizing. Subtext in Sera's study of cog and silence carries ambiguity. Minor overtness ("Competing narratives. That was all it ever came down to.") slightly abstracts but ties to closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (strata as records, patience as callus); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell them I'll stop when they can cut a cog like this"). Rhythm modulates tension; no head-hopping or withholding. Diction purposeful, philosophical without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks—e.g., "scraping his thumbnail along a cross-section" propels via image. Minor figurative density ("air pockets like arguments") purposeful, not overwriting in peak (cog reveal). Propulsion clean to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: strata-reading philosopher in post-plague sewer transforms preservation trope via empirical walls/cog evidence. Risk in abrasive calm voice heightens stakes without gimmickry; turns (Sera's fracture) inevitable from setup. No derivative templates; particular details anchor originality.</comment>
