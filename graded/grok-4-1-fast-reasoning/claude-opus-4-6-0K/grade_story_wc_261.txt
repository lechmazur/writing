<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses—grief over erased scars vs. emerging plant communion—earned through embodied tremors and micro-choices like gripping the table; final acceptance of dual passages forecloses direct scar-reading with felt loss of personal strata.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from coffee rings to oak revelation; closure as Conceptual Repricing ("displaced miracle: her history, translated into chlorophyll") lands on-page with conceptual cost of transformation, not erasure; orientation anchored immediately in tower post-surgery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring hourglass and coffee rings constrain choices and charge final inversion image; sensory details (green hum, jasmine sweetness) selectively filter through Maren's telepathic bias, evolving with dawn's gold pour; micro-setting of palms on wood grounds embodiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar-loss tightens via oak's message, reweighting to growth under Accumulative lens; agency in inverting hourglass forecloses stasis with cost of unmeasurable time; stakes viscerally embodied but slightly abstract pre-revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-as-wisteria emerges organically from scar-compost cycle and tunnel motifs, reweighting premise without statement; final descent image offers resonant answer to closure-seeking, embracing complexity of simultaneous passages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in remnant-reading (coffee rings as tunnels) and biased noticing (plant hum over pain); lyrical compression taught early, stable close-third POV modulates rhythmically to charged poise at "sand began to fall"; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (roots through "Roman pottery and medieval bone") coherent and pattern-taught; varied rhythm propels to dawn break, minor density drag in scar enumeration but no loops or closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-telepathy-chlorophyll cycle transforms closure tropes into organic inevitability; bold risk in plant voice as tectonic wisdom heightens stakes without gimmick, hinging on "scars are not gone" turn.</comment>
