<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the decoding beat (scars ache amid thrill of recognition), earning the final renunciation of avoidance with embodied cost in the scars and erased architecture of her life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as snow disturbances build density to Charged Poise closure (memorize/scatter/stand), with legible cost in the final bluff-edge image where mist thins to reveal sun, reconfiguring exile into persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Snow as micro-setting constrains decoding choice before thaw erases it; recurring mist evolves from hush to lifting veil, charging the horizon-sun image with thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Internal stake (exile vs. re-entry) signaled early tightens via message decode under accumulative lens, forcing endurance agency in erasure/decision with felt scar-cost charging final descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding to bear weight emerges organically from scar pulls, snow erasure, and "tentative, persistent" sun image, offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (spy-pattern eye on stones/prints) with rhythmic modulation from dawn chill to lifting mist; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; syntax varies propulsion from ascent tension to decoding clarity, culminating in crisp final image free of figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow-as-code transforms burned-spy trope into prudently daring medium with fresh self-destruct logic; risk of lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
