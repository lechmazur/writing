<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via skin-absorbed griefs and bone-melody mapping; contradictory refusal to grieve self earns release at "vast and unnamed ocean." Final renunciation forecloses borrowed pains with embodied cost. Minor abstraction in early trait summary slightly dilutes peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations/notes densify into self-map melody, resolving at stillpoint silence/release. Closure as RR (release claims self-tone) with legible cost in "instead of absorbing, she released." Orientation anchored early; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forest's ultrasonic vibrations constrain bare-foot dowsing and charge ring's stillpoint; body/skin as micro-setting filters sensory hierarchy. Details selective (e.g., "frequencies that shattered crystal") mirror internal geography without overt symbol. Evolving earth notes integrate via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-map via stillpoint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as melody assembles interior crater/ocean, forcing release agency. Cost unmistakable in outpouring languages, reweighting refusal. One tightening via converging silence suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self amid absorbed others emerges via melody charting "crater where her sight had been"; final ring "points steadily inward" reconfigures without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in retained blindness lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with touch-biased perceptual signature (e.g., "absorbed...through the skin"); rhythmic modulation builds to blazing quiet. Compression taught early via vibrations pays off legibly. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring vibrations; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak release. Minor figurative density (e.g., "phosphorescent fungi") purposeful for textural lens, supports read-aloud rhythm without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms blind-tactile mapmaker trope into emotional geographies and skin-languages with ultrasonic specificity; skin-release synthesis inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
