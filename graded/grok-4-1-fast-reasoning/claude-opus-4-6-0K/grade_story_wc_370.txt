<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (empathy as blade yet gift) act in the reading scene, earning the release with visible emotional cost; past mistake compounds into present choice without tidy rationalization. Interiority particularized in crumpling ritual and hands on pages.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of paradox reflections builds to CR/RR closure in ink darkening and hands opening; orientation anchored by ~50 words (sidewalk, laundromat); cost legible in "guilt she had clutched like a crumpled piece of paper."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library micro-setting (cedar oil, rearranging stars, candles) constrains climax choice (hands on fading Codex) and charges final image ("candles flared gently, their enlarged tranquility flooding"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward paradox perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth wisdom to save Codex) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via realization of past "staying while leaving"; agency in reading forecloses hiding path with legible emotional cost at "she had never truly left."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Paradox theme emerges organically from Codex passage and Maren's arc, answered non-literally in final image of closing book/opening hands that reweights mistake as "truest reading"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in wound-as-door.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (paradox-filtered noticing, e.g., "stillness... full, the way a held breath is full"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You crumpled my invitation" tests resistance); rhythmic control modulates to tranquility at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "She placed her hands... ink darkened" packs action/image/resolution); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "ozone of ideas sparking") without muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms secret society trope via laundromat paradox and recluse's return; fresh synthesis of empathy/error as wisdom feels inevitable, with risk-taking in metafictional library risking gimmickry but heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
