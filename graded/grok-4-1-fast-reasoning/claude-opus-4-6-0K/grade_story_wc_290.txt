<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (prudence vs. drive) act simultaneously when "Prudence said to retreat. But the compass point tugged forward," earning the final choice to pry the stone and exit with visible claustrophobic cost in chest-tightening relief under open sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via grooves and leaning walls to organ chord's cadence shift (DC/RR), closing with Key recovery and mutiny's resumption as legible cost in final exit image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nexus under starlight constrains choices (open sky endures claustrophobia; flagstone grooves guide action), charging final image where stone scrapes behind her departing figure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Key recovery) tightens via organ's freeze narrowing options to the hidden groove; agency in prying stone forecloses retreat with cost of walls resuming lean post-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of architecture's forgetting vs. sound's reminder emerges organically; final image of carrying "antidote" wistfully honoring Voss reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobic sky-relief; prudent tool-trust); rhythmic diction modulates pressure, as in "stone grinding against stone like the clenching of a jaw."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in tension beats); no loops, purposeful figurative layering like "spatial mutiny" taught early without muddle in peak chord moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted architecture as "spatial mutiny" tamed by organ's "rebellion of sound"; compass "remembering" grooves transforms trope organically, risking bold conceptual logic to charged close.</comment>
