<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's decisively kind trait drives key micro-choices like tracking Phuong and pausing to center before entering, earning the reunion; Felix's motivation rooted in concrete shard-sniffing and wife-memory anchors his smile at fragments joining. Internal endurance in singing through death shows contradictory hope/grief embodied without therapy-speak. Phuong's steady hands apply relational pressure, forcing flawless goodbye execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mundane details density-build to charged poise closure: record shards reunite on chest amid final song, reconfiguring loss with cost in "the stillness was no longer pulsing." Orientation anchors early (hospice haven, Room 12 by para 2). Single scene causality intact via Maren's prior call enabling Phuong's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring vinyl shard as micro-setting constrains emotional reunion choice and charges final image on Felix's chest; alpine glow through window mirrors luminous grief, filtering via Maren's ministry lens. Sensory hierarchy sharpens to needle-groove click in song. Spatial choreography clear: bed, stool, blanket track bodies cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye via shards/song) signaled early tightens accumulatively as Phuong places crescent, narrowing to held-note stasis with death-cost in quiet room. Agency in Maren's tracking/singing forecloses denial-path. One deepening suffices, charging final breath without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope as released past emerges organically from shard-sniffing, mundane lyrics, to final "scent of hope... gently released"; resonant non-literal answer in gold clouds/record image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in imperfect wholeness ("still pieces missing") embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-close Maren POV stable with perceptual signature in hymning details (coffee percolating, dog's head); rhythmic prose modulates to short breaths in closure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("There she is"). Diction controlled, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "morphine drips ticked like metronomes" advances setting/atmosphere/rhythm). Varied syntax propels to flawless held-note cadence; minor motif repetition ("pulsing stillness") purposeful, not looped. No scaffolds, read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: floating hospice + vinyl shards reunion transforms death trope into textured farewell, inevitable via shard backstory; risk in "hymning mundane" heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes, perspective memorable in alpine glow/scent.</comment>
