<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's skill in identifying footsteps by sound roots motivation concretely, driving her to follow maps despite risk; final acceptance earned via layered trust tests. Limited contradictory impulses shown in scene, but micro-choices under storm pressure reveal values hierarchy. Strong individual traits via embodied perception avoid stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via map layers and sound navigation to Charged Poise closure: "She pocketed the key... and whispered her answer. It carried perfectly," reconfiguring options with trust cost. Orientation anchored early (labyrinth worker, storm night); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Towering containers and aurora-lit corridors constrain navigation to sound, charging final hum "like tuning forks" in teeth/bones. Sensory hierarchy (footsteps over sight) POV-specific; storm disables electronics, forcing deepening. Micro-setting (junction box, grating) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (follow mystery walker) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through map unfolds and footstep pursuit to meeting; agency in deciphering paths forecloses doubt with trust trade-off. Cost legible in isolation risk under storm; no reversals needed, pressure coheres to crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening/whispers emerges organically from footsteps/maps to final resonant image: answer "carried perfectly," reweighting shouts vs. quiet without statement. Libra coin shifts meaning, charging balance; ambiguity in recruitment lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-texture (groan pitch, vibration in teeth); stable third-limited POV with sensory bias. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("The key was the test"), advances goal; rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory propulsion without loops (e.g., footstep catalog vivid, non-redundant). Rhythmic variety accelerates to whisper closure; no scaffolds, figurative control (aurora "sickly green," walls "hum like tuning forks") coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: footstep library + origami maps transform labyrinth trope into sound/textural world; recruitment turn inevitable from skill pattern. Risk in storm-disrupted nav heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
