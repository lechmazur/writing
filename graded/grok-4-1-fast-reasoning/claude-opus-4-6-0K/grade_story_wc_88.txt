<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in "Beautiful, she thought, and then immediately: so what," rooting post-procedure flatness; final flicker emerges as earned endurance with conceptual cost of rebuilt empathy, satisfying 9+ test without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations layer to Charged Poise RR in final line—"sat down across from Farrah, and listened"—with legible conceptual cost of nascent empathy; orientation anchors by para 2, no lens ambiguity, closure image reconfigures emotional rule-set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and tunnels constrain choice (seven branching paths) and charge final image (light intensifies "as though the lake itself was paying attention"); sensory hierarchy reflects jaded POV, micro-setting evolved via causal glow shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tunnel choice narrowing options, recognition of Farrah deepening knowledge, to ending flicker forcing stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in "stubborn as those ancient organisms," but minor abstractness in tunnels slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable past emerges organically via particulars (baseball lifeline, decoded papers); final image offers non-literal resonant answer—"faintest flicker"—reweighting procedure's "clean slate" without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("jaded wonder," intellectualizes beauty); rhythmic control modulates to compression in tunnel ("water was warm around her ankles"), no head-hopping, voice-biased diction fits post-procedure flatness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., baseball turn reveals curiosity survival); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to closure without overwriting; read-aloud ear confirms natural propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-traveler baseball as curiosity lifeline into biolum labyrinth transforms tropes; risk-taking in post-procedure flatness heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight payoff in flicker without gimmickry.</comment>
