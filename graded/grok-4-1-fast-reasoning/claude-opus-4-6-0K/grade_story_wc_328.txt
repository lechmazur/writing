<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the climactic lift-off, where bitterness yields to belief through embodied micro-choices like gripping the arrowhead; final renunciation earned by voices' slow unmaking of her motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising density of confessions to cadence-shifting closure (Earned Stasis); cost legible in "carry the frostbitten hope... until the laughter finally caught," foreclosing descent with legible opportunity price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden-as-antenna (roots, troughs, limestone hum) constrains climax by channeling resonance, charging final image where mugwort sways upward and boots reground.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove vs. join harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via confessions' deepening until gravity's softening forces stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in chosen isolation from "harmony untamed."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness as self-cage emerges organically from voices' confessions reweighting Maren's motive; final image (boots touch, applause) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (skeptical researcher filters anomalies through career bitterness); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse closure actions, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images (e.g., "water... rose in silver ribbons"); zero loops, varied rhythm, no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity anomalies, phone confessions, and arrowhead tuning fork transforms cryptid tropes into inevitable cosmic joke; risk in quiet stasis closure heightens resonance.</comment>
