<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (should sleep but traces patterns) act in scene; final belonging earned via shared work and staying, with isolation cost foreclosed. Kosta applies relational pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitude to collaboration to plankton bloom as Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "I've never watched long enough to see it with someone," reconfiguring isolation with felt relational price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome and bioluminescent plankton constrain observation-only choices and charge final image of glowing city. Sensory details (pressure creaks, prismatic shadows) filtered through Marina's pattern-seeking POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Belonging stake signaled early, tightens texturally via Kosta's arrival and shared plankton gaze forcing stance crystallization. Minor subtlety in external pressure, but agency in staying forecloses outsider path with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of made-belonging emerges implicitly via feather-to-plankton progression; final image ("they watched together until...both, now, could feel") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (patterns "everywhere," shorthand merger); rhythmic control heightens plankton climax. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("You see patterns out there").</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; purposeful figurative ("shadowseam where wonder lived") coherent without muddle in peak plankton beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Landscape astrologer premise fresh synthesis of astronomy/archaeology underwater; plankton-as-fireflies turn inevitable from patterns motif, risks bold lyric closure.</comment>
