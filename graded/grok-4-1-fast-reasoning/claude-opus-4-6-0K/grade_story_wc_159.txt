<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied sorrow and contradictory impulses—watching orchids illuminate yet resuming systematic tapping reveals hierarchy of values with endurance cost. Motivation singular and intensifies via personal lullaby recognition, compelling renunciation of total preservation. Final micro-choice to continue despite knowing "She would not save them all" earns stasis without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine density builds to song-triggered illumination (inciting beat), tightening to charged poise in dimming orchids and resumed tapping as Conceptual Repricing—reconfigures preservation as endless vigil with her own name's future cost legible in "long after Maren herself became a name that needed preserving." Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constraints choices: cloud sea and terrace railing frame pause, glass orchids demand tactile resonance-testing that mirrors internal stakes. Recurring cracked chime as micro-setting charges final image by emitting song, reweighting loss. Sensory selection (ringing stems, glowing petals) POV-biased toward sounds, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading names) signaled early, tightens via song's momentary revival that exposes costs—orchids dim "reluctantly, like eyes closing in sleep," forcing endurance over futile chase. Agency in systematic listening amid beauty/loss interweave; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in stakes ("names fell silent forever") tempers peak from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty/loss as "same substance viewed from different angles," crystallized in foxglove regret image without statement. Lullaby reprise reweights preservation motif, offering non-literal answer to futility via lingering echo. Complexity lingers in plausible counter-reading of vigil as futile heroism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable, perceptual signature sound-obsessed ("rang like bells," "warbled or went flat"). Rhythm modulates: short sentences heighten illumination ("Row after row illuminated"), prose-as-character reflects systematic mind. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm matching beats—cumulative clauses build routine, fragments spike song ("The cracked bamboo tube stirred now, though there was no wind"). Minor metaphor pile in "foxglove regret: gorgeous and poisonous" risks coherence (-0.3), but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bottled silences, sounding orchids transform preservation trope into sonic vigil, inevitable in hindsight via cracked chime reprise. Bold lyric risk (textural accumulation over causal plot) heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
