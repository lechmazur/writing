<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's listening gift and motivation to reforge the bond root every choice, with contradictory resistance during transformation ("She resisted, and her body held paradoxically steady") earning the final acceptance of otherness as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup (spices singing, trees shivering) to Charged Poise closure in reforged bond and shared metamorphosis, with cost legible in "taloned now, iridescent" hands; oriented immediately in orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's silver trees and braided roots constrain conjuring at center ring, sensory details (cloves soil, pulsing bark) filter through Maren's beast-sense, charging final blooming image without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforging bond) signaled early tightens via spice conjuring reversal (petals fall upward, hand pressure from soil), forcing trade-off in her metamorphosis with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bonds transcending death emerges organically from particulars (ashes remembering voice, shared feathers), final image ("bond reforged, stranger and fiercer") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in sensory listening ("secret languages... she listened"); rhythmic control heightens transformation intimacy without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy transformation sentences amid lyric flow); minor figurative density in opening orchard description contained, peak clean at "every cell examined and rearranged."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie origin, spice-breath conjuring, and half-phoenix rebirth transforms tropes, with risk in cosmic tone heightening stakes to shadowless closure.</comment>
