<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's love for the pit's in-between nature and inspiration from stains drive concrete micro-choices like nightly returns and improvising fragments, earning the final realization; interiority embodied in "music move through his body like weather." Contradictory impulses (others mourn while he sees intention) act in scene with visible cost in physical exertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wading/discovery to playing fragments; on-page CR closure via stain's arm-lowering and understanding reconfigures overlooked spaces with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains choices (case above head, podium dry spot, ripples from bow); lanterns' copper waves and shifting stains evolve causally, charging final image where water stills. Sensory hierarchy via musician's eye (stains as staves/faces) mirrors internal drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel/play ghost code) signaled early, escalates via program decode and fragment assembly under Accumulative lens; agency in disrupting silence narrows doubt, with felt cost in "breathing hard" and foreclosed abandonment. Final cadence shift reweights with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden music in margins emerges organically from stains/program/playing; final stain change offers resonant non-literal answer to intentional damage without moralizing. Particulars like bled ink and whisper bow recharge prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (flood as artist, stains with intention); rhythmic modulation peaks in playing ("ripples spreading outward... faces turned"). Lyrical diction controlled, prose as character via musician's synesthetic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short final sentences for hush); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (watermarks as hands/staves). Propulsion weaves sensory action without overwriting in peak playing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: flood revealing marginal ghost score transforms haunted-theater trope; risk in lyric Accumulative build pays off via irreplaceable water/program interplay heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
