<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via embodied vibration "through her bones, through something deeper"; contradictory impulses (past softening vs. defiant report) act simultaneously before earned choice to send unredacted; final renunciation forecloses complicity path with Hargrove confrontation cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/reflective density tightens via vibration-triggered memories into Charged Poise closure ("She would send the report to Hargrove and to the oversight board simultaneously"); cost felt in "He would be furious"; orientation anchored early, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tunnel micro-setting constrains choices (darkness demands lantern for recording) and charges final image ("left the lantern... still warm"); lantern recurs as witness, vibrations mirror internal shift; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (empirical details like frayed cable over generic).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break free via full report) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through memories forcing stance crystallization; agency in kneeling/recording/writing forecloses softened-report option; cost visible in ignored reports parallel and impending fury.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of breaking control emerges organically from particulars (Aldaine's ignored reports, Underground Railroad echo, her compliance); final image resonant non-literal answer ("tunnel held its breath behind her") reweights drought metaphor without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with empirical perceptual signature ("pattern visible only through empirical observation"); rhythmic control modulates from observation to charged poise; purposeful compression in memories pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frayed cable overhead still sparking faintly" advances plot/setting/empirics); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion accelerates to closure without overwriting in peak memory beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lantern + entangled tunnel memories transforms ghost-of-place trope into empirical witness driving defiance; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
