<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory "furiously tranquil" impulses act simultaneously in sorting beat, rooting motivation in lineage; palms-to-tiles endurance forecloses forceful reopening with granular cost, earning stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hatching incites density buildup; entropy decrease via sorting reconverges vault patterns, landing Charged Poise in "life had remembered how to begin" with texture cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-glazed tiles and starlight constrain sorting choices via alignment demands; acorn cap at fountain charges vortex hum and final palms press, mirroring internal weave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hatching tightens stake to reopen vault post-emergence; creature's breath deepens pressure, forcing order trade-off with borrowed time's dense granularity as on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Borrowed time reconfigures dormancy from fragile to "dense, granular, heavy as wet sand"; final image answers inheritance question non-literally via seeds stirring without melt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fixates on spirals and prisms ("vortex sang its silent, ordered song"); rhythm compresses under pressure in sorting without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; dense propulsion peaks in "molecules aligned. Chaos remembered its older name," varying syntax without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Entropy-decrease method transforms seed-saving trope via prismatic creature and vortex; risk of lyric order-emergence heightens stakes, inevitable at "icebound atrium became...a greenhouse again."</comment>
