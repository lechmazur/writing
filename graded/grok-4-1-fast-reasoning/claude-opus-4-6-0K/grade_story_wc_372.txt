<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's gently meticulous trait drives concrete micro-choices like precise sampling amid fading shelves, earning the final logging with embodied cost (burning fingers); interiority particular without epiphanies; minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps just below peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: process builds from setup to chime on eastern shelf, delivering CR closure in "corona of light...flared, then steadied, then softened into something warm" with felt cost of prior silences and climb; orientation anchored by para 1; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library constrains via ladder climb and opaque shelves pressuring search, charging closure image with crystal page's waveform; sensory hush (quartz hush, frost breath) selective through Elara's priorities; body/tool (fingers burning) as micro-setting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor one vow) signaled para 4 tightens accumulatively via shelf silences to chime reversal, narrowing options with agency in persistent scanning; cost legible in "hours passed...Shelf after shelf returned silence" before payoff; moral calculus in non-heroic devotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of enduring meaning emerges implicitly from Dissolution fade to matched vow's warmth reweighting premise; final image answers "one promise...resonated at its original frequency" without moralizing; no token motifs, resonance from particulars like braided waveforms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (precision as prayer); rhythmic control modulates from hush to chime's cut; purposeful lyric compression taught early (thresholds of silence) legible at closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short chime sentence cuts hush); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful (vapor as punctuation) without overwriting in peak (chime to warmth); read-aloud rhythm breathes with glacial time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Dissolution catastrophe with luminous vows transforms archive trope into frequency hunt; risk in solo lyric quest heightens stakes via irreplaceable slide/page match; inevitable hindsight from opening climb to descent proof.</comment>
