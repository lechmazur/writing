<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in consistent traits intensifies compellingly to her departure, with embodied emotion in the censer's "impossible solidity." Internal conflict between aiding others and self shows in micro-choices like building the antenna for strangers. Final renunciation earned by calls' accumulation; minor slip in told epiphany ("understood then") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of calls, map tacks, moon cycles builds to Charged Poise closure as she leaves under "sky so thick with stars it looked like static," reconfiguring her navigator role with felt cost of abandoning the station. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via pattern emergence suffices. Cost legible in broadcasting loop for strangers while walking her own path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective: "three dead highways converged," scavenged basement parts constrain building; bronze foot as micro-setting charges final image ("warm against her hip"). Sensory hierarchy via navigator's bias sharpens ruined coast. Environment guides choice to leave, mirroring internal loss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's location via calls) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via decoded pattern terminating at Colmar; agency in transcribing/planning forecloses staying with visible cost of departure. Last call ("The censer is missing its foot") tightens decisively. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-map doesn't dull closure pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of personal navigation through loss emerges organically from charts-for-others to self, censer motif shifting meaning. Final image ("building the road to her own raw and necessary homecoming") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in drowned town's wait invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: navigational lens filters world ("reading broken things"). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity; purposeful compression in calls' fragments legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding; voice particular in phrases like "geography of loss."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "The new antenna... hummed behind her, broadcasting a looping message"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; zero figurative muddle in peak (departure beat). Opening/closing lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-flood reverse migration navigated via moon-tied cryptic calls transforms dystopic tropes through lived particulars like bartered charts. Quiet closure risks bold Charged Poise, heightening stakes organically. No derivatives; censer homecoming inflects inevitably from setup.</comment>
