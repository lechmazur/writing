<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to favor listening roots choices like reading the rope and delaying the switch, with embodied listening ("tracked the sound with her whole body") revealing stubborn humility against colleagues' dismissal; internal endurance of her method earns closure satisfaction without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atmospheric density builds to zero hour test; closure as Charged Poise in descent ("quiet satisfaction... know when to stop") with legible cost of the fleeting hush passing, rope swaying as final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope as recurring object constrains choices (wind gauge more sensitive than instruments) and charges final image ("rested her hand... begun to sway again"); sanctuary's open walls and cloudline enable acoustic purity, filtering through Maren's professional ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of validating siren resonance tightens via zero-hour convergence ("spectrograph readings flattened"); agency in flipping switch forecloses test window with cost of hush releasing, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of warnings knowing when to stop emerges implicitly from siren dissolving into silence and final descent image reweighting listening's value; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like tone's boundary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with acoustic perceptual signature ("low, glassy hum"); rhythmic control modulates from preparatory hush to sustaining tone, diction biased toward silence/sound nuance without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., rope's sway signaling pressure drop advances setting/stakes); varied syntax propels to peak switch without loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle in test beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic testing at ruined sanctuary transforms siren trope into meditation on silence; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early hunch.</comment>
