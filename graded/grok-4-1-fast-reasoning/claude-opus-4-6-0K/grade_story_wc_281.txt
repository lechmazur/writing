<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic shines in "loved him with an affection that coexisted stubbornly alongside her skepticism," propelling the phone call's offer to be "the skeptic and the subject"; embodied contradictions (panic to method) earn the hopeful stasis without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via somatic buildup to photo reveal as CR, repricing withdrawal as "map" with legible cost in "fragile... hope... that could shatter"; orientation anchored early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Studio's wands and cameras constrain the somatic method, geode sliver charges final image when "holding the geode sliver up to the monitor's glow"; sensory hierarchy (ozone/lavender, mica fractals) biases via Maren's light-painting lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to map withdrawal deepens via agency in wand traces per "somatic markers," forcing renunciation of damage view; cost unmistakable in photo's recursive paths mirroring enduring sensitivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of body's hidden cartography emerges organically from geode-photo reprise, final image reweights pill premise without moral ("willow glass held up to morning light"); ambiguity lingers in "not peer-reviewed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (light fractals, "frozen lightning") biases vividly; phone dialogue subtextual ("That's beautiful... not peer-reviewed") advances while distinct from narration; rhythmic control peaks in somatic movement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("prickle... spiral... descending loops"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (geode/nervous system), rhythm propels to "tuning fork struck once and still ringing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Somatic light-painting post-recall synthesizes pharmacology/art organically, risking fragile hope's poise; geode-photo turn inevitable from particulars, transforms empathy trope boldly.</comment>
