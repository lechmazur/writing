<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through appraisal lens; contradictory impulses peak in shaking hand during clinical measurement of valve, earning final endurance without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from radio texture to valve discovery tightening density toward CR closure ("weight...could not be measured. Only carried"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in final dark silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's calcium-water smell, echoing boots, seized valve constrain exploration and charge ending image; sensory hierarchy reflects Ren's priorities, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weigh swallowed truth) signaled early, textural deepening at valve beads forecloses measurement option with embodied cost (shaking hand), agency in dark stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of immeasurable grief/truth emerges from radio parallels, beads, silence without statement; final image reweights appraisal premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in appraising ruins/calls; rhythmic compression modulates from drowsy drive to charged hush, POV stable and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "beads clicked softly...rosary stones"); varied syntax, no loops or overwriting, ear-test flawless through peak valve beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms urban exploration trope via family ghost shift and beaded memorial synthesis; fresh CR in unmeasurable silence feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
