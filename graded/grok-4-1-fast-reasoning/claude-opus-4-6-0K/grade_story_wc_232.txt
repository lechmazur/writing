<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Empirically intuitive trait shines in ants-as-guide moment, rooting motivation in promise and loneliness with contradictory temptation embodied in trembling hands at socket; earned stasis via renunciation forecloses reunion path with visible cost. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in cavern pause. Flawless hierarchy of values in final touch-and-turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from backstory shards to cavern bloom and vision; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost legible in "first peace... hollowed her out for seven years" after refusal. Orientation anchored early in valley/shop. One tightening via ants suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains via rising water at ankles and fissure crawl, charging final image of transparency; empirical filter on ferns/ants/seeps reflects priorities. Sensory purposeful (warm sweet air, fungal glow). Micro-setting (chip socket) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise to access choice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via key-fit vision forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable in foregone reunion, charging poise. Agency in refusal alters stance under lens. No reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empirical endurance over mystical redo emerges organically from maps-to-ants pattern and refusal image reweighting promise as structural beam. Resonant non-literal answer in crawl to light. Ambiguity lingers in "less wise" other self.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature ("read landscapes... like faces"); diction/rhythm modulate to charged brevity in "She could step through... hollowed her out." No elision issues. Voice particular to map expert.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density with propulsion (e.g., "Following ants home. That was how she found it."). Varied rhythm peaks in cavern without overwriting. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antique maps, type chip key, ants-to-doorway transforms portal trope into empirical stasis; risk in blooming cavern payoff heightens refusal stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via promise calcifying.</comment>
