<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's expertise in absence drives consistent micro-choices like slotting the chip, with embodied emotion peaking in trembling hands; Davu's surprise trait reveals worldview without stereotyping. Internal conflict between code-chasing and belonging resolves via earned realization. Minor backstory tell anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chip arrival deepens pattern to frequency CR, with legible cost in Maren's shift from absence to presence. Orientation anchors early via drone feed and platform. Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dusk observatory constrains via crumbling dome and platform, charging final star/exhale image; drone feed filters through pilot's thermal bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows to heat anomaly and stars under rising stakes. No generic placeholders; tactile handling of chip integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early, deepens via chip slot revealing planetary hum, narrowing to emotional reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in inputting ratios forecloses code-message path with felt trembling cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of distributed belonging emerges via chip sequence and realization, resonating in drone's overhead view without moralizing. Davu's "missing pieces were never lost" line borders echo (-0.4), but final image reweights premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (absence expert scanning feeds/mosaics); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices idiomatically. Rhythmic modulation peaks in terse revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines (e.g., "The eighth clicked home" advances plot/atmosphere); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Final exhale image clarifies without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech, ancient chips, and planetary frequency transforms ruin-puzzle trope; risk in poetic tone heightens belonging resonance without gimmickry. Star trails method inflects organically from setting.</comment>
