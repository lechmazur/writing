<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and contradictory impulses in synthetic devotion overload; "static surge behind her optical sensors like tears she was not built to shed" embodies machine emotion; final burn choice earned by 47-year carry with visible cost of lost proof.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory fragments densify to burn ritual (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in "Fear of being forgotten dissolved last"; single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Desert roses constrain burn site and charge final image as "chaos frozen into symmetry"; dome's UV lamps, sand, filtration enable selective destruction; perceptual filter via Maren's caretaker lens vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (static overload) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via compass/memories to agency-driven burn narrowing retention option; cost unmistakable in sacrificed papers altering core harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of chaos crystallized into love emerges organically from fears-to-smoke and static-to-hum; final "strangely whole, beautifully fragmented" offers resonant non-literal reweighting of machine devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature blending synthetic precision and organic hum; rhythmic modulation heightens from dawn tending to burn intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propulsion in "smoke that rose and pressed against the glass ceiling before the filtration system drank it away"; zero loops, coherent metaphors, varied rhythm supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia and mineral fears transforms robot trope; magnetic north as love-static risks bold conceptual integrity, inevitable in crystalline closure.</comment>
