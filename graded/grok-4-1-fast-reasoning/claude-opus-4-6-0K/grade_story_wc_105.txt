<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via synesthesia (hears aurora as hum); motivation intensifies through father's memory pressing into wafer, earning imprint with embodied cost of personal loss. Contradictory impulses in seeking rupture to heal; final endurance of uncertainty reveals values hierarchy. No safety-hedging; flaws (own grief) drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to imprint, cadence shifts to Charged Poise closure ("She set the wafer... Tomorrow she would climb"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "She did not know if it would work" and final listening reconfiguring poise amid doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (aurora as sound/color); setting constrains via forge from wreck keel, greenhouse glass channeling lights—charges final image. Details evolve (aurora shifts red to green); micro-objects (wafer, driftwood housing) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint trust's fracture for girl) signaled early, deepens via memory recall narrowing to personal frequency—one tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens. Agency in pressing memory forecloses generic method; cost felt in uncertainty scaling to "battered marvel" poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (beauty regenerating from absence) emerges via particulars like sideways apple trees, cells dividing; final image ("listened to the aurora sing green") non-literally reweights loss as survivable. Subtext in gesture/silence; invites ambiguity without tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("filtered... into something almost musical"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure without filter excess. Prose as character: syntax reflects fractured perception (trust as "hairline fracture... cells divide").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density (lines multitask image/motif/advance); rhythm varies (short punchy imprints amid lyric flow), no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent/purposeful ("apple trees... roots threading portholes"); propulsion peaks at forge pulse without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: absences forged into hearing aids amid sunken orchard transforms loss tropes organically. Risk in conceptual hearing (trust as cellular split) heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from aurora-fed forge to regenerative close.</comment>
