<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in psychometry's "low hum beneath her sternum"; motivation intensifies through pull to letters/film, earning her letter as renunciation with cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in her eavesdropping on dead vs. finding safety. Final choice reveals values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: readings build density to CR closure in "love...lodges in...hands of strangers," with cost in Maren's added letter foreclosing her isolation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity; single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Booth's "cellulose and dust" and "carbon arc lamps" constrain actions (threading film) and charge final "ghost of light"; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (film handler's callouses via psychometry). Recurrent canister/reels mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love) signaled early, escalates via psychometry→film→projection under Accumulative lens, with agency in threading projector narrowing to realization. Cost legible in her letter's addition, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of migrating love emerges organically from letters/film, resonant CR in "It was always safe" reweighting Estelle's silence without moralizing. Final image answers question via charged poise, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vibrational readings; voice modulates rhythmically ("clattering...mechanical heartbeat"). Diction character-bound, no leakage; elision of Estelle taught via film.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere ("jar holds fireflies") without muddle in peak projection beat. Propulsion via varied syntax matches scene cadence; zero scaffold in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry + spliced film love transforms trope into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
