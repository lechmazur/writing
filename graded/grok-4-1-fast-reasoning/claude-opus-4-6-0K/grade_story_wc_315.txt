<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's attentively inventive shorthand and embodied burden ("watcher's burden... carry the weight") compel steady guidance; contradictory isolation vs. trust preservation acts in crisis, earning final endurance with logbook cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from static clearance to canopy click, delivering Charged Poise closure in logbook symbols for "silence between two people when one... is falling"; orientation anchors by para 2, cost legible in perpetual burden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor perch constrains physical intervention, filtering sensory hierarchy (hissing static, nylon whistle) through Maren's priorities; charges final "branches still held" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Tomas's descent) tightens via "I can't find it" reversal, Maren's agency in precise guidance foreclosing hesitation with ragged breathing as on-page cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in "click... like a lock turning in a room she could not enter" varies rhythm without loops; propulsion aligns with crisis tempo, zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor observatory transforms isolation trope into high-stakes voice lifeline; fresh causal synthesis of pattern-seeking and falling trust feels inevitable.</comment>
