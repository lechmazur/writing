<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation to preserve identity amid loss is embodied in baking initials and lens use, revealing hierarchy of values; interior conflict in "perpetually displaced" anchors endurance with cost of adaptation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of losses to Charged Poise closure in "fractures spread like hope," reconfiguring entrapment with conceptual cost of "culture adapted but unbroken"; orientation anchored early in museum-grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice wall and mist constrain choices (constant vigilance, thawing tools), charging final monitoring image; sensory hierarchy (damp artifacts, slick streets) filters through Celeste's historical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing arts signaled early, tightens via lens revelation forcing collective agency; cost legible in acknowledged deaths and fading flour stores under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of severed continuity emerges organically from exhibits, bread, lens; final image offers non-literal resonance, reweighting displacement without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in artifact associations; voice modulates rhythmically from dim corridors to hopeful fractures, natural sparse dialogue advances ("Look").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image; varied rhythm propels, but "rosewater dread" metaphor slightly overwrought in pivot from despair.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen cultural prison thawed by opera lens and initial bread transforms displacement trope; risk in collective pivot feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
