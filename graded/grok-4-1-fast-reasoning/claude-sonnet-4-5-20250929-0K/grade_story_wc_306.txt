<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in Vincent's note intensifies via embodied doubt (throat tightens admitting nephew oversight); internal conflict acts in listening to overlapping chimes without old certainty canceling them. Keeper applies relational pressure as foil. Minor slip: diagnostic phrasing in "welcome nuance into certainty" edges below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shard anchors present, dialogue/chimes deepen to Charged Poise closure when Mara clips shard ("small offering to...uncertainty"), reconfiguring certainty with felt cost ("frightened and free"). Orientation immediate (first line: Mara/lighthouse/dawn). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse gallery constrains via chimes' harmonies guiding insight and shard's refraction charging final image (rainbow fragments). Sensory selective: salt breeze, chime materials, light scatter reflect urgency shift from hollow doubt to transformed nuance. Micro-setting (shard as recurring object) elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unhook certainty) signaled early tightens accumulatively via keeper's shard demo and multi-chime overlap, narrowing to renunciation with on-page cost (fear in smile descending). Agency in turning shard/listening forecloses old practice. Minor abstractness in ethical calculus prevents 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (certainty vs. nuance/adaptation) emerges via shard's "refracted" light and chimes' "overlapped without canceling," reweighting premise in final image (clipped shard spinning rainbows, chimes' "complicated, contradictory song") without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to Vincent's doubt. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (shard peering as doubt filter); voice modulates rhythmically (short punchy admissions amid lyrical chime desc.). Dialogue natural/subtextual (keeper's "not unchanged" pursues goal indirectly). Clean free indirect; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "Light scattered... Refracted" advances plot/atmosphere/theme). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor paraphrase in wind-chime repeats purposeful for pattern. Propulsion peaks in "three chime sets sang together," no overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "conscience for hire" transformed via chimes/shard into nuance method, risking quiet epiphany over plot punch. Non-obvious cloak-of-doubt arc feels inevitable from Vincent cue. Bold vulnerability tone heightens stakes organically.</comment>
