<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Mira's "carefully reckless abandon" while writing act simultaneously under pressure, earning the final hand-meeting choice with relational cost; Marcus's reactions reveal distinct voice and apply crucible pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as writing and reading density deepens stakes to Charged Poise closure ("hands met beside the crystalline ink well"); orientation anchors immediately in archive with Mira; cost legible in diverging paths reconfigured by truth-web.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ink well recurs to constrain writing choice and charge final image, catching light between hands; sensory details (dust smell, lamplight refractions) filter through Mira's linguistic priorities, evolving with action without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early tightens via Varesh reading validation under accumulative lens, narrowing options with cowardice exposure; agency in writing/reading forecloses silence path with felt relational cost at hands-meeting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth surviving distance emerges organically from Varesh web and final "interconnected promises" image reweighting divergence without moralizing; subtext in shimmering phrases layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV to Mira with perceptual signature (language as symphonies); dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Read it aloud"), natural, goal-driven; rhythm modulates from writing tension to closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels from "hand cramped" embodiment to final image; metaphors cohere (truth-webs, symphonies) without muddle in peak reading beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Varesh truth-symphonies premise freshly synthesizes linguistics and relational stakes, transforming apology trope via lie-proof script; risk in script mechanics pays off inevitably at validation, heightening closure.</comment>
