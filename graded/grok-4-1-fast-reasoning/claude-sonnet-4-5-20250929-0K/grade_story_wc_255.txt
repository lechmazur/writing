<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's colorblindness as power source drives specific micro-choices like reading plant textures and bartering the reed, with her flaw (seeking imperfections) complicating and earning the final realization. Tomás's slumped moment reveals character through action under pressure. Contradictory impulses in valuing "worn down by living" act in the barter scene, compelling the closure choice with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant trail density builds to reed barter and painting, culminating in CR closure via final reed image reweighting imperfection's beauty with conceptual permanence cost. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/phoenix event. No orientation debt; single scene with legible movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurrent plants and scorched earth constrain Maya's path and mirror her texture-perception bias; glass wind chimes and reed charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (texture over color) reflects POV urgency. Courtyard evolves causally from drowsy to stirring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (barter awakenings against phoenix dreaminess) signaled early, tightens via Accumulative density in painting beat narrowing options to reed's imperfection cost. Agency in following plants/barter forecloses non-trade path. Escalation reweights via communal stirring payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically from barter and reed's reprise, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior plant/reed particulars. Subtext in "bartered awakenings" avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in permanence's oblique cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (grays/textures bypassing "eye's defenses") biases noticing; voice modulates lyrically in painting without head-hopping. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Bartered awakenings"), goal-driven. Rhythmic control heightens reed finale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., reed as "tiny golden flame" advances character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (embers/reed vibrations). Propulsion syncs with beats, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind awakenings/barter/imperfection transforms fantasy tropes via courtyard's textural logic; reed's evolution from trash to proof feels inevitable. Bold risk in plant semiotics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
