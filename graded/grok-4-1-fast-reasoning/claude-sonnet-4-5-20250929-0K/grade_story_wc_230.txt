<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's rationality clashes with "something loose in her chest" from Henrik's plea, earning her deal and final realization as endurance with isolation's cost. Contradictory impulses act in-scene via dismissal of relic yet pocketing it habitually. Final choice forecloses pure isolation path visibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fungal mapping to eye find to gatherings density-tightens to CR closure where "rationality... recognizing... frameworks" reconfigures isolation with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ladder descent in orchard by word 50. Final image of eye on post makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hanging orchard's "gnarled branches clinging to rope bridges that groaned" constrains descent and frames gatherings, charging final post image. Sensory hierarchy (wind, mud, truffles) reflects Mira's foraging bias. Environment mirrors fractured bonds without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation for safety vs. relic-enabled grace) signaled in retreat preference, tightens via Henrik's desperation forcing deal that risks contact. Agency in "I'll make a deal" endures exposure with felt cost in observed careful speech. Escalation coheres accumulatively to realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ritual enabling "difficult grace between" truths emerges via relic's placebo effect in gatherings, reweighting Mira's premise non-literally in final truffles image. Resonance from particulars like passed eye, no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "mapping fungal networks, tracking rainfall." Dialogue natural/subtextual: Henrik's whisper vs. Mira's "just glass." Rhythm modulates from efficient descent to reflective close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: "glass eye half-buried in mud... weight... significant" does image/motivation/action. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; final "hidden things could flourish" propels with image. Zero scaffold in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-virus world and placebo relic transforms isolation trope via foraging rationality into grace ritual. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight from eye find to beacon.</comment>
