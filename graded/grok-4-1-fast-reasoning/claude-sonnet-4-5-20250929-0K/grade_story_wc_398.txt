<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in fragment-keeping compels invitation and parallels-drawing, with embodied tears on Elena signaling earned stasis; minor therapy-speak in "intersubjective understanding" slightly undercuts peak embodiment without touching closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as parallels density reconfigures mismatch into understanding; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "forever mismatched, finally understood" with relational cost legible in dawn walk together-yet-apart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and skeletal vines constrain isolation till dawn and charge final image, mirroring internal states through selective sensory filter (fog lifting reveals rows); no generic placeholders, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering via parallels signaled early, tightens via Elena's reveal reversing letter assumption; agency in sitting-sharing forecloses reunion with felt separation cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches nurturing complexity emerges organically from vines/letter/us particulars, resonant non-literal answer in vineyard's "beautiful mistakes" reweighting failure; near-explicit "failure...perfect" borders echo but ties to image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Marcus with perceptual bias (vines as parallels); dialogue distinct/subtextual ("We were terrible together") advances goal; rhythmic control heightens under dawn pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm (short declarative peaks like "Tonight, she was coming back"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures (honeyed light) propel without overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reunion trope via vineyard mismatches producing medal wine; risk in subtle passion transforms cliché into inevitable "perfect failure" reconfiguration without hedging.</comment>
