<question>1</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with micro-choices like deploying the null-field revealing a hierarchy of values under drone pressure. Contradictory impulses (risk of smuggling vs. fostering connections) act simultaneously, earning her endurance in the final delivery. Minor abstraction in reflective motivation ("find where broken promises heal") slightly tempers peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via absence patterns, holds to Charged Poise closure in bottle placement and "emptiness could be filled" reconfiguration with conceptual cost of ongoing rebellion. Orientation anchors (Maren, arcade, twilight drop) by para 2. Single scene tightens meaningfully via drone whir and watch blink, no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Arcade's skeletal carousel and cobalt walls constrain choices (null-field base, dead-drop) and charge final shadows from bottle lightning. Sensory hierarchy narrows to whir/immediacies under drone stress; absences as "nothing" filter through Maren's bias. Twilight hush evolves with footsteps, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (safe delivery amid drones/borders) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Samir addition, drone overhead, and timed exit narrowing options. Agency in absence-linking forces trade-off (silence with Samir), with felt cost in "trapped and trying to remain powerful." Subtle tightening suits lens but lacks one sharper option foreclosure for 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection-through-absence emerges organically from deliveries (17 families) and storm motif shifting to daughter's power. Final image ("daughter would hold her father's storm") offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting borders via conceptual cost without moralizing. Particulars like null-field avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in "storms in bottles."</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature ("linking absences," "brittle hush"); diction/rhythm modulate from hushed to pulsing storm. Silence as purposeful non-dialogue advances pressure; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice reflects Maren's quiet rebellion, certain only in her knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crackling softly" advances object/stakes/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in short drone sentences. Minor paraphrase loops in "absence" reflections purposeful under motif but verge on redundancy near end. No artifacts dull closure image; metaphors consistent (thunderstorm/lightning).</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of absences-null-fields-drones transforms border trope; storm bottle as daughter's collector inflects smuggling organically. Risky accumulative poise heightens stakes via silence choreography without gimmickry. Non-obvious moral calculus (politics severs love, but voids connect) feels inevitable in dead-drop payoff.</comment>
