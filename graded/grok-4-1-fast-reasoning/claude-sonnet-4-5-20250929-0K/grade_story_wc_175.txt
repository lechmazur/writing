<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between permanence and ephemerality act through building choices; final knot-easing renunciation earned by witnessing monarchs on her tower. Interiority particular (knot in chest) without labels. Micro-choices under migration's finality reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: butterfly density pattern break reconfigures witnessing stake with conceptual cost of unmonumented endings. Closure CR in final monarch landing and moth-wing touch makes before/after legible. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via gathering monarchs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's altitude/thin air constrains tower build, charges final image of transient garden humming with sleepers. Sensory selective (silver scales, blushing light) through Mira's priorities; mirrors internal transience without overt symbols. Spatial coherent, body/tool integration via knotting bamboo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor last migration) signaled early, deepens via monarch arrival foreclosing permanence illusion with sorrow cost. Agency in building/witnessing narrows to endurance under lens; felt price in "knot eased slightly" charges poise. One tightening sufficient, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tower's ephemerality vs. stone monuments, resonant in final shoulder-landing reweighting "interrupted cadence" without statement. Particulars (moth wing, bamboo dissolution) drive ambiguity of memory/forgetting. No moralizing; counter-reading of ownership lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biased to esoteric geometries (dust-fine scales, question mark tower); rhythmic control modulates from building urgency to stillness. POV stable single third-close; purposeful compression taught early, paid in closure poise. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "orange wings catching light that seemed to blush"); rhythm varies for propulsion, zero loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (living petals), no muddle in peak (monarch cluster). Paragraphs purposeful, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of impossible grotto + ephemeral signals transforms migration trope via esoteric realism; risk in altitude defiance heightens witnessing stakes. Final wing benediction inevitable from particulars. No derivatives; bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
