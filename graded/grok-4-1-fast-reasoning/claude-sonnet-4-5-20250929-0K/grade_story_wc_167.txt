<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via scarred hands and childhood stone habit revealing consistent traits; realization earned through embodied stone-throwing under hollow-work pressure, but direct articulation in "This was his work" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via successive ripples reweighting mundane stake; CR closure lands on-page in "the work remained the same; the seeing was different," with conceptual cost of prior hollow feeling foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium and pond constrain revelation choice and charge final image of departing ruin; sensory details (mist, noctilucent glow) selectively bias glazier's perceptual priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (hollow seeking) signaled early tightens accumulatively through stone throws creating deepening patterns that narrow to presence renunciation; cost legible in shifted seeing foreclosing routine dismissal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mundane value emerges organically from ripple interference and light-bending images; final CR image reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant via "patterns that emerge when simple forces interact."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with glazier-specific perceptual signature (fractures, light passages); lyrical rhythm modulates from mist-clung calm to dawn-strengthened cadence without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, insight without loops; rhythmic variety propels via varied openings, though lyric figuration dense in ripple paragraphs borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh glazier-physics-mundane synthesis transforms epiphany trope via interference patterns and "grammar" of ordinary; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
