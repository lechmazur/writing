<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in laughter as shadowed elation, with trembling fingers under pressure revealing hierarchy of absurd faith over fear; prophetic flaw complicates endurance visibly. Minor telling in backstory examples slightly flattens on-page micro-choices at wick positioning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to wick click and light's temporal bend; CR closure lands on-page in steered beam piercing time, with conceptual cost of fragile boundaries legible in final image. Orientation anchors early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Green glass walls and Fresnel lens constrain wick adjustments, mirroring internal states through refractions; lighthouse charges final emerald stars image, with sensory hierarchy (lightning greetings, howling wind) selective to Kael's prophetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn via routine) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via wick alignment to light's time-bend tightening options; agency in infinitesimal adjustments forecloses failure path with isolation cost felt at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light/dark as teacher emerges organically from particulars like shadow patterns writing dawn; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (steering darkness home), reweighting prophecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of refracted meanings biasing notice (e.g., light splitting into "warning, welcome"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity at wick click, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with figuration patterned around refraction paying off at light burst; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, though minor overwriting density in reflective beats dulls peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse ritual bending time via laughter-prophecy transforms tropes organically; risk in temporal light-steering heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at emerald stars close.</comment>
