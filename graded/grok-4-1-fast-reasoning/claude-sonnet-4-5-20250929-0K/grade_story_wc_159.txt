<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preservation and transformation act vividly in the chime decision, earned by embodied foxglove regret blooming in her chest; final renunciation forecloses repair with felt cost. Interiority particular through mother's song echo tying to Thessaly. No label-speak flattens peak; micro-choices like 45-degree tilt reveal systematic values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chime crack to song recognition, culminating in Charged Poise RR where hanging it reconfigures preservation stakes. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Miren watering in opal library). Cost legible in "foxglove regret bloomed," charging final image without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal walls and clouds constrain choice by framing isolation above forgetting world, charging final whisper/image. Glass orchids as micro-setting evolve tactilely (gleam like frozen music, taught to sing). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: systematic notice of prismatic light, bamboo coolness. No white-room; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve extinct feelings) tightens accumulatively via chime's pattern break—old tone vs. new song—forcing renunciation that forecloses repair. Agency in "would not repair it" narrows options with legible regret cost. No static pressure; single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of breaking birthing beauty emerges organically from chime event to final aria image reweighting preservation without moralizing. Foxglove regret particularizes complexity, inviting ambiguity on loss/transformation. Closing "this one was hers alone" resonates non-literally, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature systematic/selective (drops per stem, crack's underwater voice). Rhythm modulates reflective intensity without drift. Purposeful compression of memories legible under Accumulative lens, no elision cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayered (e.g., "clouds drifted past like slow thoughts" advances setting/theme/voice). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—crystalline motifs cohere. Minor figurative density in reflection fits pattern, untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct feelings museum transforms nostalgia tropes via cracked chime's new song, risking lyric Accumulative frame that heightens stakes organically. Final image inevitable from particulars; bold world logic commits without retreat.</comment>
