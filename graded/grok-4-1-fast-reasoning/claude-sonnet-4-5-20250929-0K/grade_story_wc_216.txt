<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve old time intensifies through concrete actions like tracing the urn fragment and leading the group ritual; internal endurance feels earned without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density tightening to CR closure in final image of shard raised to light, reweighting the Shift's cost; shards transition legibly without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald silo's green glass anchors and charges final image, constraining Mira's secretive work and mirroring elastic time; sensory details like light on panels integrate purposefully through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering fixed time signaled early via visitor, tightens accumulatively in group sharing that forecloses regression path with Fluid Timers threat felt; cost legible in traded certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of lost temporal certainty emerges organically from urn dates and group ritual, resonant CR in final shard image reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in preservation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward time fragments; distinct voice in listings and explanations modulates rhythmically, dialogue natural and subtextual in visitor exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid images like "gold lettering" propels accumulatively; minor paraphrase in reflection on Shift ("stretching and compressing") but no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-Shift world transforms time nostalgia into secretive garage-sale code and silo rituals; risk in Fluid Timers opposition heightens stakes organically.</comment>
