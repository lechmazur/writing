<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via spinal resonance and bell evolution from hated to connective tool; motivation intensifies to shared realization without unearned epiphany. Minor telling in "powerfully gentle in her conviction" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound layers densify to CR closure ("Maren finally understood") with conceptual cost of near-permanent loss legible in final image; orientation anchored in para 1, single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Carbide lamp constrains (filters light for openness) and charges final image as "small sun"; sensory hierarchy sound-dominant via POV bias, golden shadows evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (synthesize belonging) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via layered sounds and volunteer response narrowing isolation; cost felt in volunteer's softening amid post-collapse hunger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic belonging emerges via particulars (breath catches, simultaneous harmonies), final image reweights pilgrimage as internal travel with non-literal resonance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature sound-centric and biased; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Just stand here"), subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variation; "powerfully gentle" repeat purposeful for voice, no loops dulling closure; minor scaffold in reflective blocks but anchored to present cues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archaeology, spinal instrument, frequency pilgrimage transforms post-apocalypse tropes; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at shared stasis.</comment>
