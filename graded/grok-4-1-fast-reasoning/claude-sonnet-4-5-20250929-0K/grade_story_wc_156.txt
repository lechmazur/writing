<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in methodical tracing yielding to risky tapping of the wall; final choice to clean rather than report earned by nested discoveries with career cost felt. Interiority particular via dream splinters and vibrations. No stock phrasing; flaws drive inevitable deeper probing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of coin, voice, hollow echo, nested mural tightens to CR closure where choice reconfigures dreaming/waking with cost of unreported find legible in final brushstroke. No orientation debt; pattern taught early pays off seamlessly. One tightening via wall tap suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's parabolic dishes and chimes constrain path to revelation, charging final breathing fresco; coin as micro-setting handled tactilely alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects restorer's priorities. Specificity anchors surreal without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early via dreams, deepens accumulatively through reflected voice and nested hand narrowing to report/restore trade-off. Agency in tapping and cleaning forecloses official path with implied professional cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one decisive knowledge shift sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nested murals and phrases ("Wake to wake," "To know is to sleep") emerge organically as awakening theme, reweighted non-literally in gold center and final nickel-pointing image without moralizing. Complexity lingers in dream/reality ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward vibrations and layers, lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences in pause moment). Voice distinct and embodied; no head-hopping or withholding. Compression purposeful, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsive work without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (chimes intensify mirrors escalation). Minor repetition of "methodically playful" contained, no artifacts dull closure. Figuratives (Russian dolls, splinter) coherent, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden, dreaming murals, guiding hobo nickel transforms restoration into infinite awakening loop. Risky surrealism grounded in tactile specifics heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight via nested particulars.</comment>
