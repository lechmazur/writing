<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional depth in Kael's arc: contradictory impulses in "cautious abandon" reveal via trembling fingers and past theft of trust; final amendment earned through on-page placements and guardian's response, with relational cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: secrets accumulate density toward Charged Poise closure as Kael pockets completed sundial and descends; orientation anchored early in ascent; cost felt in embracing feared wrongness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spire's crystalline chamber and frost constrain choices (scaling steps, chess table staging); brass sky charges final descent image, mirroring internal shift; sensory details (breath crystals tinkling) vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend trust) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via chess placements and lid return, narrowing to embrace unknown; agency in micro-choices forecloses hoarding with emotional cost on descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flowing secrets emerges organically from swaps and guardian's line "secrets are meant to flow like water"; final image reconfigures collecting as theft, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable, perceptual bias in "wrongness... terror and exhilaration"; dialogue subtextual (guardian's knowing smile, laugh), distinct idiom; rhythm modulates tension seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short sentences in placements build propulsion); no loops or artifacts; purposeful figures like "rice paper thin as wishes" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mystery-thief via hollow chess secrets transforms tropes; risk in brass sky's conceptual repricing feels inevitable, heightening stakes through spire's isolation.</comment>
