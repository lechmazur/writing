<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's genetic lightness embodies joy/grief contradiction, shown concretely in floating then grounding under Akio's disapproval; Akio applies relational pressure via criticism that forces her defense. Final hand-hold earns relational reconfiguration with felt cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("shadow work") slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shimmer patterns densify to resonance chamber activation, yielding Charged Poise CR as dimension opens with luminous emptiness glimpsed "through it." Orientation anchored early (spaceship, post-last human). Cost legible in "terrible beauty of completion" and facing shadow before extinction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tear and photos constrain climax (fractal arrangement amplifies resonance); body lightness charges opening image of rising. Sensory hierarchy via Mei's bias (salt patterns as text). Recycled ship history subtly pressures via "every layer...pressing against her consciousness," evolving to final shimmer spread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate grief/open dimension) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Akio's opposition then chamber activation narrowing to confrontation. Agency in building/apparatus peaks with on-page glimpse/cost of intertwined grief/joy. Entry to 8.8+ via trade-off in pushing feared door.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of integrating shadows emerges via particulars (tear patterns → resonance), final image reweights as shimmer transforms ship without moralizing. Subtext in Akio's softening invites ambiguity on "some doors must be opened." Resonant non-literal answer in "last necessary reckoning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Mei-limited POV with perceptual signature (reading grief contours, impossible colors). Dialogue subtextual/natural: Akio's "some dimensions should remain closed" pursues pacifism goal. Rhythmic control modulates to thickness of "air...thick with memory" under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "salt crystals catching photons in patterns that spoke" advances setting/theme/action). Varied rhythm suits lyric build; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peak metaphors ("luminous emptiness...pooled like water") purposeful for resonance, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief spectroscopy + Tear unlocks dimension, transformed via Mei's lightness/joy-mass physics. Risk in Accumulative sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes; irreplaceable ingenuity in shimmer frequency beyond four dimensions charging CR.</comment>
