<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in editor's precision drives all choices, embodied in tracing condensation and shouldering pack; Petrov applies doubt as crucible. Subtly confident trait shown in posture Petrov notes, with dry wit distinguishing voices. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal decision caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns (falcon, maps, condensation) tighten to Charged Poise closure as she steps onto ice, reweighting atlas errors with conceptual cost of hidden source. Orientation anchored early (outpost, lake, dawn return). Single scene with one deepening suffices; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain choice (thin ice now drillable after winters); condensation pattern charges final image of dried convergence ghost. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's hydrological eye (moisture flows) integrates purposefully. 9+ test met: recurring ice/glass guides action to ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover river source) signaled early, accumulates via falcon data tightening options; agency in prior falcon send and final step forecloses desk-bound caution with felt isolation/risk cost. Petrov doubt complicates. One deepening under lens suffices, but no reversal narrows sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patterns revealing hidden origins emerges organically from map edits, falcon, condensation to final ice image repricing myths as map errors. Subtext in "myths start somewhere" lingers without moralizing. Resonant non-literal close: water points home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (hydrological patterns in ephemera); voice modulates poetically yet precisely, matching editor's eye. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Petrov's "chasing ghosts" vs. her "following the water"). No head-hopping; distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue beats vs. flowing images); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion peaks in "ice beneath her boots was older than cartography," charging closure. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: atlas editor decodes global rivers via falcon/condensation under melting ice transforms cartography trope organically. Risky quiet poise ending inevitable from particulars; no derivatives.</comment>
