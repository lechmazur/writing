<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frugal traits shown concretely (patched trousers, cheap camera, last savings spent) root motivation and earn final weeping; interiority particular without therapy-speak. Minor flaw: one epiphanic summary ("spiritual kinship") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries layer density to CR closure (treatise unearthed, covenant sealed) with felt cost in her devotion and isolation; two shards transition legibly ("Three nights later"). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective details (shadows revealing symbols, ground resonating) constrain choices (twilight wait, hand-digging) and charge final image; dusky harmony recurs purposefully. POV bias sharpens astronomical noticing without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding ancient alignment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shadow reveal narrowing to desert coordinates; agency in quick sketches and journey shows cost (savings gone). Closure cost legible in weeping amid harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of devotion bridging eras emerges from particulars (tile to treatise) without statement; final image reweights modern vs. ancient irony non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in knowledge's future lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature (star-chart focus, shadow tracing) modulates rhythm with pressure; no dialogue to judge. Voice texture distinct in astronomical idiom, stable under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, density high sans loops; purposeful repetition ("encrypted devotion," "dusky harmony") motif-taught without scaffold. Minor paraphrase in reflection beats ("love letter to the cosmos") but closure propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magic square encoding stars transforms trope organically; fresh synthesis of Babylonian artifact as celestial map with shadow mechanics feels inevitable. Risk in frugal quest pays off without gimmick.</comment>
