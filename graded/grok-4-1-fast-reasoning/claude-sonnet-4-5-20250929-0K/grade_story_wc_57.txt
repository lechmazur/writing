<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in devotion, shown through patient coaxing of knots; embodied patience in snow and fog. Minor telling in backstory summary ("Mira's motivation... transformed into something like devotion") slightly abstracts peak realization but doesn't touch closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to Charged Poise/CR closure in final image of re-sealing rope amid fog, reweighting preservation with conceptual cost of time's knots. Orientation anchored early (dock, Mira, snow); no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dock, rope, fulgurite constrain choices (kneeling edge, coaxing in cold/fog); fog/snow evolution mirrors internal deepening, charging final suspension in "white silence." Sensory hierarchy (hush, breath clouds) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/preserve) signaled early, escalates via sequential revelations (fulgurite as marker to bark map), narrowing to re-sealing choice under lens. Felt cost in accumulating snow/patience legible, though internal more than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encoded wisdom emerges organically from particulars (seeds, knots, fulgurite); final image ("holding rope that held memory") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting past-present continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (knots as "rosetta stone," nature's "knotwork"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush to closure poise, diction character-specific (patient, oceanic).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short breaths amid lyric swells); no loops/artifacts, figurative control purposeful ("reluctant flower") in peak decoding without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knots/fulgurite/seeds as encoded wisdom transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at fog-erased closure.</comment>
