<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's confidence amid confrontation ("But you won't") reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Magistrate's softening eyes and key reveal earn the mutual enabling shift with relational cost. Final micro-choice to add key to tools forecloses safe obedience path. Blind spots (assuming secrecy) compound via his reveal, balancing competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriented immediately in sanctuary with Mei forging; Situational lens holds as revelations force stance crystallization. Closure as CR: key reconfigures treason as sanctioned permission, cost legible in Magistrate's "stripped of my position, perhaps my life." No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; one tightening via his emergence suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stalactite drips mask footsteps and mark rhythm, constraining stealth; aurora lights key reveal and dances on marble, charging final image. Heritage rose thorn on desk mirrors internal states via Magistrate's touch. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (calligrapher notices ink bloom from drip).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful grain decree) signaled early tightens via confrontation revelation, forcing trade-off endurance with Magistrate's sacrifice cost. Agency in Mei's precise stroke completion and decree sealing under pressure; situational lens escalation crystallizes complicit stance. Moral calculus (treason vs. compassion) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sanctioned betrayal emerges via rose wisdom and key-as-permission, reweighting "calibrated treason" without statement. Final image of tools collection plus blooming rose offers non-literal resonance to forgiveness of unfinished. Subtext in silences (unreadable face) and irony (prior forgeries known) invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (aurora gleams, ink blooms); dialogue subtextual ("Such confidence in a traitor") pursues goals. Rhythm modulates: short amid reveal, lyrical in closure. No head-hopping; distinct voices (Mei direct, Magistrate soft).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (drip rhythms pace revelation); high density integrates setting/action ("brush trembling above parchment"). Minor figurative density ("green fire dancing") in peak but pattern-taught via aurora motif pays off without muddle. No loops; propulsion clear to charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Key-with-no-lock transforms enabling trope organically; "pearl twilight" neither/nor duality inflects treason premise freshly. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via conscience calculus, inevitable in hindsight from rose setup.</comment>
