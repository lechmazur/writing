<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via Iris's confession of distance as protection, earning her final choice to read the book with relational cost from sister's rift. Interiority particular through wedding ghosting embodiment. Flawless under pressure without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of paradoxes tightens to CR closure in "reading herself back into the world," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of prior absence; invitation-to-library ellipsis motivated. Orientation anchored by laundromat ~50 words. One deepening via storage door suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library's curving shelves constrain discovery and charge final reading image; laundromat hum and thigh-smoothing ground body in setting. Sensory selection (no shadows) mirrors internal shift from static to tranquility. Specificity integrates via goal-directed entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (presence without drowning) signaled in invitation reflection; woman's line "Staying while leaving wasn't your mistake" deepens under accumulative lens, narrowing via reconfigured paradox with felt sister-cost. Agency in entry/whisper forecloses hiding path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges via book of "handwritten stories," offering resonant answer to paradox question without statement; final image reweights "staying by choosing when to go." Complexity in ambiguity of belonging lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (lingering customers as "waiting without waiting"); dialogue subtextual ("Everyone here is hiding") advances without exposition. Rhythm modulates from hum to soft light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density in "shelves that curved into themselves" propels via varied syntax. No overwriting; opening "crumpled three times" anchors stakes rhythmically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms secret society via "impossible dimensions" and coffee shop facade; paradox premise fresh, inevitable in hindsight with risk of enlarged space charging closure.</comment>
