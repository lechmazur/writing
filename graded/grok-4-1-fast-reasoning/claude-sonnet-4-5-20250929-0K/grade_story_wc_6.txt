<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's unyielding compassion rooted in contradictory shame and proof-seeking drives concrete micro-choices like the coin ritual; Elena's doubt applies crucible pressure, yielding earned transformation without therapy-speak dominance. Internal conflict embodies via "old shame rising and settling," compelling higher-stakes vulnerability. Final necklace act forecloses isolation with relational cost on Elena.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rituals (sand pour, coin placement) tightens to Elena's "Yes, they're singing" as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring grief with emotional cost legible in softened shoulders. Single scene anchors who/where/when by paragraph 1; no orientation debt. Closure image of settling sand undeniably reweights premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choices (waist-deep wade suspends sand) and charges final image (dark stars singing); firefighter senses filter wind/temperature vividly. Sensory drift (cool water, black sand patterns) mirrors internal graft without overt symbolism. Body/environment interplay embodies keloid scars via tactile ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scars singing via compassion) signaled early, deepens via Elena's "How can you speak of beauty?" reversal, narrowing to coin acceptance under Accumulative lens. Agency in Maya's rituals forces Elena's stance crystallization; cost in hesitation/shame viscerally felt, charging poise without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-song emerges organically from obsidian formation, grafted trees, drilled coin—reweighted in Elena's smile without statement. Final image answers "prove scars can sing" non-literally via suspended sand settling, lingering ambiguity in Maya's carried shame. No moralizing; irony in father's destruction grafting her strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Maya's perceptual signature (fire senses, "gracefully alert"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from alert descent to kelp-drift peace. Dialogue subtextual—Elena's whisper pursues doubt, Maya's replies graft revelation naturally. No head-hopping; elision of radio crackle pays off in prioritized call.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("black sand drifted... reverse stars"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—fire/water obsidian motif coherent. Elevated diction fits poetic voice without register drift. Final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist legacy into firefighter's scar-grafting ritual transforms redemption trope via Korean coin/volcanic physics. Risky lyric compression heightens emotional stakes organically. Hindsight inevitability in ash-to-music arc.</comment>
