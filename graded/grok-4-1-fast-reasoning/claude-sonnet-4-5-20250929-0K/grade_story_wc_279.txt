<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moth's social perceptiveness and chalk-driven motivation compel micro-choices like interjecting to preserve the old man's memory fragment, earning her endurance at closure. Interiority is embodied in sensing "shape of things" via tile, with unlearning costs felt tactilely. Minor flaw: early backstory block on unlearning slightly abstracts initial drive before anchoring in present drawing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mandala density builds from deliberate strokes to unintended spirals, people gathering, mist sacred-ifying unease into Charged Poise CR where "place where meaning lived" reconfigures forgetting's premise with ongoing erasure cost legible in final "kept drawing." Orientation anchors firmly in first paragraph. Single scene, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustics and mist constrain drawing's listening via tile and pool reflection, charging closure image; lilac-to-sacred shift mirrors internal emergence tactilely through chalk nubs. Sensory hierarchy (whispers, warmth) biases to Moth's perceptual gift without catalog. Object-as-setting (tile flake) enables pivotal forehead press.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning via art) signaled early tightens accumulatively: unplanned spirals + emergent faces narrow to collective framework, forcing endurance over erasure with felt cost in half-words fading. Old man's gasp tests commitment; no reversals needed. Minor abstractness in "anchor against tide" but dramatized in interjection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-holding memory emerges organically from chalk geometries surfacing "ghosts of names," culminating in non-literal CR repricing unlearning—not recovery, but framework—at "smiled and kept drawing." Subtext in silences (don't speak) invites ambiguity without morals. Final image reweights mess into sacred without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with whimsical perceptual signature ("memories flaking like old paint"); diction/rhythm modulates from unease to hush-music. Brief dialogue natural, subtexted (old man's gasp vs. Moth's soft guide). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels: short interjection snaps tension amid flowing descriptions; high density layers sense/action (chalk extension of listening). Purposeful metaphors ("lilac unease," "cupped palms") cohere without muddle or loops. Minor scaffold in early reflection para, but advances present stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unlearning-reappearing-in-hands premise ingeniously synthesizes via tile/mandala, transforming forgetting trope through perceptual art; closure's framework inflects fresh. Risky lyric build heightens without gimmick; irreplaceable acoustics/patterns feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
