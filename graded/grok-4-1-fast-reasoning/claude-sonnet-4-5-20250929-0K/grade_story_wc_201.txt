<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's embodied contradiction—nerves mapping Fibonacci spirals amid phantom pain from enhancements—shows impulses toward mercy clashing with trauma; final mask-laying choice earned by prior calculations, foreclosing pain-focused math with penance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density builds to Charged Poise closure in violet canopy gaze and mask unclipping; orientation anchored early in forest dump post-anesthesia; cost legible in "bracing... against the terrifying possibility of peace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest's pulsing veins and precise tree ratios constrain Sera's hypersensitive perceptions, mirroring internal math while soothing nerves; charges final planting image as growth geometry, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy-through-math tightens accumulatively via old man's revelation ("Mercy has no formula"), forcing renunciation; agency in sinking/asking to plant forecloses prior path with embodied cost under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of calculated mercy shifting to growth emerges implicitly through forest harmonics vs. interrogation geometry; final "root" image resonantly reweights premise without moral, tying arc to question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—proprioceptive math-sensing—stable in third-limited POV; dialogue subtextual ("You're still looking for it"), goal-driven; rhythm modulates from tense to poised without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory math images into action without loops; minor figurative density in opening forest pulse purposeful under lens, propelling to closure; varied syntax breathes with realization beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive sci-fi and math-mercy penance transforms trauma tropes via UV forest geometry; risk in quiet planting closure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
