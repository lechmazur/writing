<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong arc from mechanical precision to fluid integration, with embodied change at moonstone touch ("felt herself change") earning final building choice; minor reflection summary slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaf patterns build density to CR closure ("She had become the message") with conceptual cost in transformation; orientation anchored early in arbor/seed vault; speck prod tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor vividly constrains (seed vault anchors sorting ritual, oldest branch holds speck) and charges final image (branches spread wider); selective sensory filter (silver leaves, copper light) mirrors POV priorities without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/repair via remembrance) signaled early, deepens texturally at speck sequence narrowing to deliberate building; agency in prodding/touching forecloses prior precision with transformation cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-repair emerges organically from leaf mandalas and seed whispers, resonant CR in "became the message" reweighting sorting as ritual without moralizing; no thematic echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns as star charts/alphabet); rhythmic texture modulates fluidly from precision ("precise arrangement") to mystery without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels accumulatively (e.g., leaf-fall "deliberate sequence" beat clean); varied rhythm, no loops/scaffolds, figurative coherence (e.g., "veins through twilight") purposeful without muddle in peak speck moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyborne post-Severance world with leaf-script folklore transforms tropes via seed monuments; risk in lyric CR payoff ("reaching toward reconciliation") feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
