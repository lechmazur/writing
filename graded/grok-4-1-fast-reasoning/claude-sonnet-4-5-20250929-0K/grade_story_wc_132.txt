<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via micro-choices like leaving moss despite control instincts, earning final renunciation; interiority particular through leaf-handling embodiment. Flaw of over-control complicates and drives surrender with felt identity cost. No therapy-speak; voice coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant examples builds to cadence shift in CR closure via leaf release, reweighting control premise with dissolution cost legible in "never been more present." Orientation anchored early; single scene with anchored reflection fits defaults; one tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis constrains as microclimate enabling ferns, charges final image where leaf rests "among the moss where new growth waited." Sensory selective via POV (plant relations, rainwater heft); mirrors internal wildness without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs surrender) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through acts narrowing to observation-only path; cost of old identity loss felt in "dissolution... uncomfortable." Protagonist agency in micro-choices forecloses control, charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from plant failures/thrivers reweighting "force growth" premise; final leaf spiral offers resonant non-literal answer via surrender image, embracing reluctant complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in plant-vein symmetry, leaf textures; rhythmic diction modulates from analytical to present ("leaf trembled... let it go"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tucked it into her shirt pocket, feeling its delicate structure against her heart" advances emotion/closure); rhythm varies naturally, zero loops or scaffolds; clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of researcher-to-nursery epiphany via volunteer linden specificity transforms trope; quiet CR ending risks bold lyricism heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
