<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority through mapkeeper's particular lens on ripples and fractals as decision paths; motivation intensifies via embodied desperation against penetrating hum. Micro-choices like examining ice cracks reveal values with visible competence balanced by alien distortion pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the activation beat keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from descent through distorted resonances to RR closure in "bloom of hush opened like a flower in his chest," reconfiguring noise into spaces; cost legible in lantern darkening and absorbed light. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One tightening via stone resonance suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves and ripple/ice details filter through Kael's expertise, constraining path choices and charging final "caves sang a new song"; sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis (vibrations in bones, low thrumming felt). Micro-setting of stone alcove mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (counter unbearable hum) signaled early, tightens texturally via distorted acoustics to bloom expansion narrowing noise options; agency in palms-on-stone endurance forecloses clawing chaos with lantern cost. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "presence—a flowering of peace" emerges organically from ripple patterns and stone working, reweighting trauma's "cracks" in final village breath image without statement. Subtext in spaces-between-sounds invites ambiguity on bearable peace. Protagonist arc inextricable from reading patterns for hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with perceptual signature in wave/frozen fractals noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from jagged distortion to hammered repose. No head-hopping or withhold; diction controlled, lyric compression taught early via maps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful ripple recurrence constraining closure; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds dulling peak "bloom spread outward." Minor elevated diction in "hammered repose" fits voice without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ripple cartography and resonant hush counters alien noise via ancient instruments reveal; risk in textural quest transforms tropes into inevitable "path to peace lay in learning to read...cracks." Non-obvious bloom as counter-frequency heightens stakes organically.</comment>
