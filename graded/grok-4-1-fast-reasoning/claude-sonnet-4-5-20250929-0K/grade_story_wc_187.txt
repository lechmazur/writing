<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elden's motivation to sculpt identity from experience drives her examination and culminates in an earned absorption into the collective, with felt cost in the quill's fall. Interiority feels concrete through embodied sensations like palm presses and breath catching, revealing preemptive nostalgia as a symptom. Minor abstraction in emotional progression prevents 9+ as contradictory impulses act more contemplatively than in simultaneous conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from troubling shadows to recursive loop realization, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where Elden becomes memory with undeniable cost in her predecessor's absorption echoed in her joining. Orientation anchors early in arrival at the observatory. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, fog bridges, and crystal shadows constrain choices by revealing temporal anomalies and charge the final dancing shadows image. Sensory details like rain droplets refracting lightning filter through Elden's archival priorities. Environment evolves causally with quieting storm mirroring hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archival integrity tightens via shadow angles suggesting futures, deepening to recursion that forces stance crystallization in her palm press. Cost legible in quill's fall and identity instability. Agency in documentation and contact drives under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-aware memory mourning its future emerges implicitly from particulars like impossible shadows and recursive loop, reweighting preemptive nostalgia without statement. Final image of becoming bridge offers resonant non-literal answer to identity's sculpting. No moralizing; ambiguity in transformation lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature in noticing echoes and facets; diction modulates from active observation to hushed intensity. Purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early pays off in charged closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like crystal hums advancing memory stakes and atmosphere; rhythm varies for propulsion, ear-test clean. Figurative language consistent in sculptural time motif without muddle, though elevated diction borders overwriting in forecourt description. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of solid fog architecture, shadow-temporal measurement, and recursive memory consciousness transforms archival trope into bold conceptual risk. Shadow loop turn inevitable from method and setting. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
