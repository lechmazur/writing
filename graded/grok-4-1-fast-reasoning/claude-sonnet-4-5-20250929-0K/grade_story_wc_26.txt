<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sera's interiority shines in concrete ties to grandmother's stone warming in her palm, rooting motivation to preserve weighted dreams; contradictory impulses emerge in recognizing hope's need for darkness against archive's brightness. Final decision to copy old files feels earned via prior suspicion and footage cue, with visible cost in choosing harder truths. Minor slip: "Sera understood then" borders on unearned epiphany phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hunting footage to comparison beat tightening realization of dream corruption, culminating in CR closure via decision and stone placement reweighting premise with conceptual cost of unshadowed flatness. Orientation anchors early in library and role; one deepening suffices. Persistent stone constraint shapes final image payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through Sera's noticer POV—clouds as "patient ghosts," glass shelves activating via fingerprints—constraining hunt and charging dusk's amber/ash against glass walls. River stone as micro-setting recurs, embodying regret to mirror internal shift in final console placement. Sensory selection purposeful, urgency narrowing to footage textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spotting dream corruption to preserve hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via comparison reversal deepening knowledge, narrowing to preserve-or-corrupt choice with agency in file-copying. Cost legible in foreclosing palatable dreams for weighted ones, felt in "luminous regret." Minor abstractness softens visceral punch of trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of authentic hope needing shadows emerges organically from footage contrast and grandmother's unshared dream, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing. Final image of stone beside files offers non-literal resonance tying light/dark necessity. Subtext in unbound shadows implies conceptual cost of standardization's flatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via "dusk noticer" thresholds biasing notice of curdling dreams and amber dusk. Rhythmic control modulates realization's poise; diction character-specific, eliding exposition for textured inference. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action like "fingerprints activating dream-glass shelves." Rhythms vary read-aloud, no loops despite lyrical repeats ("softly deliberate" voice-motivated). Minor: occasional abstract nominals ("particular gravity") slightly dilute peak comparison beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams as commodified blandness transforms dystopian trope via textured footage contrast and shadow metaphor. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in quiet CR; stone's evolution feels inevitable, non-obvious in proving reality's weight.</comment>
