<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to collect time textures drives all micro-choices, culminating in earned contradiction at closure: inventing history even amid truth ("Even here... I will record it falsely"). Interiority particular and embodied (palm on roots feels like "memory itself"). Final choice reveals values hierarchy with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to center oak via lamp hums and bonsai anomalies. Orientation anchored early (~80 words). CR closure lands on-page with cost in final notepad entry reweighting invention premise; persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth, lamps, and roots constrain observations and charge final oak image, satisfying 9+ test. Sensory details selective/POV-biased (hums as "minor third" via studious ear). Evolving environment mirrors internal quest without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to differentiate time textures escalates texturally via deepening discoveries (compression/expansion), driven by agency in charting/moving deeper. One tightening at center forces renunciation with unmistakable conceptual cost in false recording. Lens-coherent pressure forecloses authentic history path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invention preserving time textures emerges organically, answered resonantly in final entry without moralizing ("The truth needs no stationer"). Complexity lingers in ambiguity of "beautiful untruths." Satisfies 9+ test via non-literal reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature: textural, studious noticing ("silence... carried different weight"). Prose rhythm modulates precisely, voice coherent/specific ("incandescent restraint"). No elision issues; 9+ test met under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel without loops or artifacts; no overwriting (figuratives purposeful, e.g., "visual poetry"). Propulsion peaks cleanly at closure image. Zero scaffold, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes stationer, bonsai time-compression, lamp hums into inevitable CR; bold textural risks heighten stakes organically. Fresh angle on history/memory transforms tropes. Non-obvious payoff in false recording feels earned.</comment>
