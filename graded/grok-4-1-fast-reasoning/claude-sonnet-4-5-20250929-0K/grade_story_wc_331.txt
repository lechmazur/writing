<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cordelia's motivation intensifies through embodied ritual with scarf, earning the reawakening; contradictory impulses in tender observation vs. eccentric theory act simultaneously. Interiority particular via grandmother's legacy anchoring present action. Patrons apply light secondary pressure without muddying her drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("The library was remembering itself"); orientation anchored by ~50 words (library opening, Cordelia unlocking). One tightening via perimeter walk warps reality on-page with conceptual cost in bent lamplight and breathing building.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library's hyperbolic architecture constrains ritual and charges final image; scarf as micro-setting (trailed along shelves, grows warm) mirrors internal states tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (lavender/paper dust, thickening air) reflects Cordelia's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken stories' place) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual to graduate student's "Do you feel that?" narrowing to shared warp. Agency in whispering equations forces stance crystallization with felt cost in warped corners.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories' geometric mass emerges implicitly from scarf's heat and library breathing, reweighting analog vs. digital without statement; final "pocket dimension" offers resonant CR answer with conceptual cost of coexistent time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with Cordelia's perceptual signature (orbits, hyperbolic planes); rhythmic modulation peaks in "air thickened... lamplight bent strangely." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advances shared awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "She walked the library's perimeter, trailing... whispering equations"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures integrate without muddle. Opening anchors stakes, final recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic stories' location synthesizes science/poetry organically, transforming tropes via 1889 architect and prime-hour boundaries; risk in warped reality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from scarf clue.</comment>
