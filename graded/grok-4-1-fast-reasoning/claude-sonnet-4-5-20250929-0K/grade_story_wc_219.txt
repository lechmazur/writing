<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's shift from clinical skeptic to feeling the pull's weight is embodied in repeated path walks and amber demo, earning her nod with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Quorum pressures via alien divergence, forcing relational reconfig. Final choice forecloses pure analysis with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density layers via pilgrimage repetitions to Charged Poise closure in Quorum's "We will walk the path with you tomorrow," reweighting homecoming with conceptual cost of impermanence in final rain image. Orientation anchored early in tower/sculpture garden. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet stone, mud prints, moss) filter through Elara's pilgrim bias, with footprints/amber constraining choices and charging final erasure image. Rain evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent in tower overlook.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homecoming chemistry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as Elara admits emotional pull, forcing alien convergence; agency in her pilgrimage narrows options to joint walk. Cost legible in erased layers/pretended constancy. Subtle intellectual scale fits lens without abstracting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of impossible return emerges via converging footprints/amber shifting to "layers of ourselves we meet," offering resonant CR in final image without moralizing. Subtext in alien's silence/divergence embraces complexity. Particulars drive irony between preservation and erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in pilgrim-noticing (moss claims, forgotten sculptures); voice textured with bell-wind diction. Dialogue subtextual/goal-driven, distinct (Elara corrective, Quorum observational). Rhythm modulates to quiet closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration (slick stairs to rain music); no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (amber/fossilized moment). Final line recharges motifs cleanly. Ear-test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: math-downloaded aliens probing homecoming via artificial pilgrimage transforms contact trope through textural layering and quiet risk of lyric closure. Footprint convergence inevitable from setup. Bold premise commitment without retreat.</comment>
