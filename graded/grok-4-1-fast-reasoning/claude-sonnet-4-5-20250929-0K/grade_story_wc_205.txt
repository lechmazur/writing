<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between revolutionary smashing and integrative honoring act in journal composition; final renunciation of clean-slate idealism earned by shard's deliberate breakage, with obsolescence as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as time-light density and shard reflections build to CR in clutched journal and gleaming corridors, reweighting civilization with conceptual cost of fragility honored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque spirals and time-light threads constrain interpretation, mirroring internal shift and charging final corridor image; sensory selection (amber light curling from touch) reflects Kasimir's symbolic bias.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visible time-light and shard-memorial synthesize loss-into-legacy originally, transforming archaeology-revolution trope; final patient revolution feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
