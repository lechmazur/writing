<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between protocols and discarding assumptions act in the recalibration beat; final integration earns change with cost of prior hollow work. Shard resonance against skin embodies revelation without epiphany dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static to hush pocket to chorus, with CR closure in shard integration reweighting silence as canvas. Cost legible in "work anew" amid transformed towers/gorge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorge and debris constrain navigation to hush pocket; recurring towers/gorge charge final image from graveyard to chrysalis/potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find more via fragment tightens via agency-driven tuning shift under Accumulative lens; cost in discarded assumptions forecloses old path, charging integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final shard whisper reweights premise non-literally: silence as "canvas on which everything began," emergent from origin codes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in frequency/hush metaphors; rhythmic control heightens hush detection without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "iron prayers"); no loops/artifacts dull closure image of humming towers/moon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh sci-fantasy synthesis of stellar hush in grounded tuning arc; risk in abstract crystal payoff heightens stakes via origin codes transformation.</comment>
