<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in trembling fingers uncorking vial under pressure; final grief earned by prior wistfulness and loss. Interiority concrete via light-scent synesthesia tied to profession. Dr. Kovač applies targeted pressure without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to UV revelation as CR, cost legible in "tears came as the colors slowly faded." Orientation anchored by ~50 words in greenhouse. Single scene, no shards, closure reconfigures loss with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse cases and UV device constrain choices, charge final image of "crystal shadows... memory of light that smelled like love." Sensory hierarchy via Maren's lantern expertise filters light-perfume. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover scent-memory for grief) signaled early, tightens via uncorking under UV with agency and emotional cost. Accumulative deepening reweights via colors' dance. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to tears as undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scent-memory's honesty emerges via ribbons of color bypassing defenses, resonant CR in "carry loss in a new spectrum" without moralizing. Particulars like sage-thyme threads shift meaning organically. Invites ambiguity on perception's honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in light-aroma fusion; diction/rhythm modulates from wistful to intense revelation. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Kovač's "help people grieve"). No head-hopping, elisions taught via empty vial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion peaks in "Ribbons of amber and rose spiraled upward"; rhythm varies with scene. Minor figurative density ("crystal shadows" motif) purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Clean mechanics, vivid verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lantern broker, scent-as-light in extinct-plant world transforms grief tropes organically. Risky synesthesia premise follows implications to CR without retreat. Final vial reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
