<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcel's weariness and professional insight drive concrete micro-choices like packing embalming tools for library restoration, earning his final realization; contradictory impulses surface in apprentice protest yet proceeding. Interiority particular via "compass of his exhaustion." Flawlessly integrates occupation with stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative dominant) holds through mosaic shards (package→dreams→descent→restoration), with legible transitions and on-page RR closure: ghosts fade after lens installation, cost legible in Marcel's bone-deep stillness and empty dreams. Orientation anchored early (Tuesday, parlor). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impossible geometry (entrance at three depths, time-bending corridors) constrains descent and work, charging final dome refraction; sensory hierarchy (brine/decay oilcloth, bioluminescent light) POV-filtered via undertaker's tactile tools. Micro-setting (diving bell, lens) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relocate restless dead) signaled via note/dreams, escalates accumulatively to restoration climax narrowing options (library whole or not); agency in "revitalize the library itself" forces trade-off, cost felt in time-flow strangeness and exhaustion. One tightening sufficient, protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (devotion traps souls; rest needs address) emerges via particulars like kelp-draped stacks shifting to refracted cathedral, resonant non-literal close in "You've given it everything—now let it hold itself." No moralizing; irony in scholars' misbelief corrected via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (undertaker notices decay, tools, order-from-chaos) with rhythmic modulation under stress ("chasing the strange stillness that had settled in his bones"); sparse dialogue natural ("The dead have hired me"), goal-driven. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "corridors that bent through time, reading rooms existing in multiple depths simultaneously" advances world/pressure); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative coherence in peak beats like dome installation. Propulsion clean to empty-dreams close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker restores impossible library via lens signals, transforming tropes (drowned ghosts, stubborn scholars) through specific devotion-cost logic; risk in mosaic impossibility pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
