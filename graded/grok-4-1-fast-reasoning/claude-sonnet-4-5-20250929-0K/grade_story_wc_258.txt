<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesper's steadily curious trait drives patient decoding, shown in measuring tape use against diagrams; Marcus's haunted inheritance compels collaboration. Interiority concrete via cartomancer's eye seeing archaeology in circuits. Final partnership earned through parallel recognitions without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from ratios matching to full map, holding to CR closure in final shuffling where patterns recombine with conceptual cost of disguised wisdom. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (loft, rain, cards). No shards or ambiguity; single scene tightens knowledge coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain evolves from drumming to mist, charging final blurred constellations; skylight, table, tape constrain focused decoding. Sensory hierarchy via Vesper's priorities (lamplight on cards/diagrams). Micro-setting (tape as tool) shapes pivotal ratio moment and charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inheritance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ratio match narrowing to full map; Marcus's confiding deepens pressure. Agency in Vesper's tracing/measuring forecloses "failed prototype" option with night-long cost. Legible trade-off in recognizing camouflaged research.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of disguised wisdom emerges via circuits-as-maps, grandmother's encoding; final card shuffle reweights divination/data as siblings without statement. Resonance from particulars (Yoruba patterns, salmon stories) avoids platitudes. Conceptual cost undeniable in "vessels that float."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (cultural archaeology in circuits); voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful (onyx-ink, recursive pathways). Dialogue goal-driven, subtext-laden (Marcus's "haunted" lean-in advances decoding). No head-hopping; elision none.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (rain as diamonds mirrors city constellations); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor density in opener purposeful for tone, not overwriting. Propulsion clear in peak decoding without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, circuits, myths transforms tropes; circuits-as-narrative-branching inevitable from tape ratios. Risk in cross-cultural mapping heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; premise commits fully to silicon folklore.</comment>
