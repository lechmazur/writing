<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied ache root motivation in consistent traits, with earned shift from prediction to translation via micro-choices like pressing shell to glass. Therapy label "chronological homesickness" introduces diagnostic speak that slightly abstracts emotion without immediate embodied cost. Final renunciation of hollow fortunes shows contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of images building to Conceptual Repricing closure: realization reconfigures fortunes as symphonies, cost legible in "hand cramped" and exhaustion claiming her. Orientation anchored immediately in spire climb. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake constrain climb before exhaustion and charge mirrored horizon image that triggers insight. Sensory details (pre-dawn light in nautilus, wind resonance) filter through Mira's priorities, mirroring internal symmetry. Environment evolves causally with dawn dissolving mirror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving hollow purpose signaled early, deepens accumulatively via nautilus mapping to writing transcription that forecloses predictive path. Agency in memory method and notebook use narrows options with visible cost (cramping hand, exhaustion). Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation over prediction emerges organically from nautilus spiral, mirrored symmetry, and spire resonance, with final image of descending with singing fortunes offering non-literal resonant answer. Complexity lingers in ache of brief lives amid cosmic music. No moralizing; subtext in rejected fortunes as chords.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature attuned to spirals, symmetries, and unheard music; diction modulates rhythmically with dawn's hush. Compression of memories taught early pays off legibly at epiphany. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor figurative density in "endless corridor of light" purposeful for textural lens without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; propulsion aligns with reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune writer as cosmic translator via nautilus score and mirrored horizon transforms tropes of epiphany and lost time. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of unheard symphonies without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight from grandfather's method.</comment>
