<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied perception of storm and objects revealing her sculptor mindset; motivation to simplify complexity evolves credibly through slide discovery. Final artistic shift feels earned via layered realizations, foreclosing prior reductionist path with conceptual cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak reflection slightly limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from GPS failure to slide palimpsest to root-ball, culminating in on-page CR where ignoring GPS reconfigures navigation and art with felt cost of abandoning tech-reliance. Orientation anchored early in truck/road/storm; single scene coherent with one deepening via inscriptions. Closure image of carrying "older alliances" undeniably reweights premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm-tossed setting vividly constrains choices (impassable road forces walk, slick archway hides slide); sensory hierarchy (wind hum, spray, kelp) reflects sculptor's priorities. Archway and root-ball charge final image, mirroring internal shift; weather evolves causally, pressuring haul back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (driftwood hunt yielding inspiration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via slide's layers narrowing to transparency method; agency in persisting sans GPS forecloses reliance path. Cost legible in physical haul and artistic reconfiguration; low external pressure caps score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of revealing layered histories emerges organically from slide's palimpsest and root-ball nesting; final image non-literally answers reduction-vs-transparency via "layer by transparent layer." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; conceptual cost in reweighting her premise lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (landscape-reading, elemental "songs"); diction/rhythm modulate from storm urgency to reverie, purposeful lyric compression taught early. No head-hopping; voice reflects sculptor's mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short storm sentences to spiraling thoughts), metaphors consistent (turbine-hum, layers) without muddle. Minor overwriting in reflective spirals near slide tracing, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Victorian slide as artist palimpsest in modern storm-chase; transforms driftwood trope via timewoven concept without gimmickry. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through irreplaceable object discoveries.</comment>
