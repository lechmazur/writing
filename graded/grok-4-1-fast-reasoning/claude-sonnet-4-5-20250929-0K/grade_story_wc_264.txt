<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to charm probability into growth feels rooted in her dreamless endurance, revealed concretely in her half-closed eyes preserving multiplicity and song weaving seeds into futures. Figure applies light pressure via warning dialogue, forcing reaffirmation. Minor abstractness in interiority ("charm not as magic but persuasion") slightly dilutes embodiment but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rails/dune approach to seed scattering and book exchange, culminating in CR closure via sprouting roots through realities and clock tick/freeze reweighting time/reality with conceptual cost of persistent fracture. Orientation anchored early ("freight guard... night rails"). No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "stubbornly alive" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dune's bioluminescent flowers and "occasionally everywhere" trait constrain choice (half-closed eyes) and charge final sprouting image. Sensory hierarchy (humming seeds, singing petals) filters through Maren's perceptual bias toward potential. Quantum rules consistent via action (seeds seeking superposition), mirroring internal hope amid ash.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate futures post-forest burn) signaled early, tightens texturally via charm song against figure's "never stops burning" warning, narrowing to endurance with felt cost in dreamless hope-carrying. Agency in singing scatters seeds; no reversal needed under lens. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of charming fractured reality toward hope emerges organically from seed charm and book entry, resonant CR in sprouting shoots reaching uncertain stars reweighting burn/premise without moralizing. Subtext in figure's echoes and clock reprise avoids binaries, lingering ambiguity of multiplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (probability as "tall grass," wave functions woven like fingers); diction/rhythm modulates poetically under delivery pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Then we cultivate new sparks"), advances stakes. No head-hopping; elision of backstory legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy affirmations at end); metaphors purposeful (e.g., "roots diving through multiple realities") without muddle in peak seed-scattering beat. No loops/scaffold; propulsion peaks in "The seeds responded, lifting...". Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantum-post-apoc synthesis (seeds humming in superposition, charming wave functions) transforms tropes via specifics like half-closed observation and divergent archive tools; risk-taking in lyric multiplicity heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at clock tick/seed sprout closure.</comment>
