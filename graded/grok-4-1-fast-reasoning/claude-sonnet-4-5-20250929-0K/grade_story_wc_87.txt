<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and embodied ("phantom guilt," stomach twist), with contradictory impulses (refusal vs. decision to launch) acting in scene; final choice earned by backstory-anchored pressure from Amy. Amy applies relevant pressure without stereotyping. Minor diagnostic edge in "flickering faith" recognition slightly tempers peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of navigation motifs (compass, poles, currents) builds to Charged Poise closure ("navigating not away from her mistakes but through them") with legible emotional cost in risked failure. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no shards. Closure image reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coastal kayak launch and utility poles as micro-setting constrain choices (counting poles for walks vs. open water navigation) and charge final image (poles vanish). Sensory details (rust-gold dawn, silver-bright water) selective via POV urgency; weather deadline guides launch. Compass as recurring object mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regain navigation despite failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Amy's plea and weather pressure to force agency (launch decision foreclosing isolation). Cost felt in "risked" repeat voyage; single deepening suffices under lens. Minor abstractness in stakes scale tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of multi-system trust emerges organically from particulars (compass, poles, gut); final image offers resonant answer (paddling "into whatever came next") reweighting regrets without moralizing. Subtext in shared brokenness avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in uncertain healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (navigation-biased noticing); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (silence in prep, calls on water). Dialogue natural, subtextual ("I didn't get it. Or maybe I did"), advances stakes. No head-hopping; voice distinct between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in launch); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent ("sandcastle meeting tide"). Minor overwriting in opening patina description doesn't touch closure; propulsion clean through action integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of redemption via mutual brokenness and utility poles as flawed certainty transforms tropes. Final reconfiguration ("use everything") feels inevitable from established particulars; no close famous echoes.</comment>
