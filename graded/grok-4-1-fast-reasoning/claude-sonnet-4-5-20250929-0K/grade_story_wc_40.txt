<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in reticence versus testimony compulsion, embodied in crystal's warmth syncing with pulse and terror of speaking; final renunciation of silence earned by prior discoveries with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR in "ready to translate silence into understanding"; cost legible in terror of speaking despite armor of silence, with library-crystal constraint shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn and crystal constrain experiment ("walls began to whisper"), charging closure image of dawn radiance syncing with pulse; sensory hierarchy (sonic/light over visual) mirrors sonic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding pattern deepens accumulatively through crystal projection narrowing to transformation realization; agency in resonator activation forecloses panic path with terror cost in final testimony stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic bloom emerges organically from crystal-refracted sequences reweighting collapse as growth; resonant CR in "breaking was sometimes just another word for bloom" avoids moralizing, lingering via children's wisdom image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sonic perceptual signature ("hummed faintly," "rhythm beneath the chaos") modulates rhythm under realization pressure; stable close third-person limited teaches patterned elision paid in charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety accelerates to closure ("dawn strengthened, filling... amber radiance"); no loops, purposeful metaphors (language shedding skin) integrate without muddle in peak resonance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic-evolution premise transforms linguistic collapse trope via crystal-library synthesis; risk of lyric accumulative closure inevitable from particulars, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
