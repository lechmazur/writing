<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martin's loneliness as empirical map expert drives micro-choices like following ants and inserting chip, with internal conflict between dismissal of grandmother's words and seeking shown in scene; final renunciation of isolation earned via visions' cost. Grandmother backstory anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (ants to wall to visions) deepen realization; orientation anchored by ~100 words; CR closure via chip removal reconfigures life-paths with legible cost of past loneliness in "lonely wasn't the same as settled."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains path via ants' trail and impossible flora mirroring hidden choices; creek pools reflect garden, charging final emergence into rain; POV-filtered details like medieval map symbols integrate with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unresolved life-paths signaled via promise tightens accumulatively through visions narrowing to choice-permission; agency in inserting/removing chip forecloses isolation with felt cost of prior inaction, legible in alternative selves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of choices as adaptive permissions emerges organically from ant-colony image shifting to Martin's sign/nephew/plans; final line reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via creek-washed tracks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with cartographic perceptual signature ("empirically intuitive"); voice modulates from descriptive to charged realization, rhythmic control in cavern beats supports pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through discoveries; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors like "scattered mirrors" integrate without muddling closure image of rain-washed daylight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms map-dealer trope via printing-matrix key to choice-map in blooming cavern; fresh synthesis of ants' adaptability and bivium originality heightens stakes inevitably at chip-fit moment.</comment>
