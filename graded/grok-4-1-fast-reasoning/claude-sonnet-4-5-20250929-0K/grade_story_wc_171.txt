<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in evolved methods, with contradictory hope/lie impulse acting in the opening lie and sustained through ritual enforcement; final endurance earned via prior causality in clipboard's history and terrace reflection. Micro-choices like edged interruption reveal values hierarchy with cost. Minor slip: generals verge on stock bristling without distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ritual density increasing emotional weight to Charged Poise closure in "Long enough to matter" and fluttering pages, cost legible in imperfect treaty and scarred terrace image. Orientation anchored immediately in terrace/valleys. Single scene with felt time jump coheres; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (scorch marks, heat pressing, breeze fluttering) constrain ritual gravity and charge final image; terrace as micro-setting mirrors endurance, POV-filtered through Maren's history. Hierarchy matches stakes: immediacies in names, subtler celestial indifference.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace via ritual acknowledgment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through voice-cracking reads and twice-collapsed talks pulled back by clipboard retrieval; agency in Maren's interruptions narrows to imperfect treaty cost. One decisive density shift sufficient; minor abstractness in "forever war" declaration untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically from ritual particulars and clipboard evolution, resonant non-literal closure reweighting abstractions via final empty pages without moralizing. Subtext in silences and weeping layers complexity; counter-reading in vulnerability lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (violence as sediment, clipboard sacred via intention); dialogue natural/subtextual ("This is manipulation—" yields to steel-edged gentle). Rhythmic control modulates from lazy sun to snow silence; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (celestial waltz, names as small deaths) accelerating to closure propulsion; varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors slightly drifts register pre-peak, but peak beats clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ritual of names transforms negotiation trope into fresh gravity anchor, risk in transparent crudeness heightening stakes via concrete loss; clipboard synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, no close echoes.</comment>
