<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict with skepticism warring wonder at the box, embodied in gentle touch and sequential presses; evolved doubt at end feels earned via persistence. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("realistically imaginative mind") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumb clues build density to courtyard pattern, culminating in on-page CR as memories release and fountains fill, with legible conceptual cost in Mira's evolved skepticism. Orientation anchors early in streets/fountains; no shards, seamless progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fountains constrain choice via constellation pattern for panel presses, charging final image; selective sensory details (chalk mark, paper crane, warmth pulse) filter through Mira's priorities. Atmosphere tensions skepticism with mystery without clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (investigate/open box despite doubt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clues to resisted seal; agency in patterned presses forecloses doubt path with evolved acceptance cost. Minor abstractness in initial stakes before box.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of persistence unlocking mystery emerges organically via breadcrumbs to memory release; final image of singing fountains reweights skepticism without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to trapped consciousness premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (lantern casts questions); rhythmic prose modulates from questioning to revelatory, lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (insects in amber, oil on water) integrated into action; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops, but occasional elevated diction borders overwriting in courtyard buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-like memories in fountains/box transforms trope via sidereal mechanics and skeptic's evolution; risk in lyric magical realism heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
