<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—flowers as defiant versus moon-rooted—act simultaneously via postcard rearrangement; priest forces micro-choice revealing values hierarchy, earning mural realization with cost of stalled work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via insight layering to CR closure at "She finally knew what to paint," reweighting artistic premise; orientation anchored by ~50 words, cost legible in reframed obsession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber panels' dusk shift to bronze constrains reflective deepening, mirroring internal reconfiguration; recurrent glass layers charge final star image as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through priest's window analogy and grandmother's note, narrowing Mara to stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed "defiant" murals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via light layers/particulars, culminating in non-literal "proper sun" resonance; grandmother's "*moon-rooted*" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Mara-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature on light/flowers; dialogue subtext advances via priest's "night isn't darkness to the flower," rhythm modulates to hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful light metaphors, varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, precise "dawning hush" anchors propulsion without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Windows-as-flowers synthesis transforms bloom trope ingeniously; quiet CR risks bold lyricism, heightening stakes via layered light without gimmick.</comment>
