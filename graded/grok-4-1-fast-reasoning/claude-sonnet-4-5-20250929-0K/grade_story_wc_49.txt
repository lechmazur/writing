<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy drives micro-choices like threading the vine and cranking; embodied emotion peaks in weeping during transformation, earning final resolve to share songs and fruit; minor lack of contradictory impulses pre-success prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as descriptive density builds from setup to pulsing vine and sound-emerging climax; closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page with arbor's geometric transformation and Cassian's weeping, legible cost in "wept as he turned the cranks"; orientation anchored early in arbor at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "hush...pressed against his ears like velvet" and "air smelled of abundance and wet earth" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal states; recurring arbor framework constrains vine-weaving choice and charges final fruit-draped image; body/tools (stained fingers, brass gears) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (machine-song success to prove remedy) signaled early via calculations and grandmother's notes, tightens accumulatively through vine pulse to purposeful growth; agency in cranking forces deepening with visible emotional cost in weeping; minor abstractness in village disbelief slightly mutes on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten songs remedying cultural amnesia emerges organically from vine's golden leaf echoing grandmother's "golden stories" to arbor's fruition; final image of sitting "among the vines, finally understanding" offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in tinkerer's whimsical noticing ("half-loom, half-musical instrument"); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed tension to abundant release; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "sound that emerged made the dawn pause" advancing atmosphere and plot; varied rhythm and strong verbs propel; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("music as architecture") during climax slightly dulls propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and primal ritual in vine-machine transforms folk tropes via specific astronomical/botanical logic; risk-taking in "notation that looked nothing like modern composition" heightens stakes organically, culminating in inevitable dawn alignment.</comment>
