<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the confrontation—flutter in chest yet steadfast reveal of the recorder—forcing an earned renunciation of open conflict with relational cost. Crenshaw's status shift from paternal to threatened applies precise pressure. Voice distinction shines in dialogue idioms under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fob reveal therefore recorder play therefore armed truce with fragile cost legible in "the truce would hold because it had to." Single scene anchors orientation instantly; Charged Poise closure reconfigures options on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pirate market's watchful commerce and repositioning shadows constrain choices during the recorder play; water lapping charges final image, mirroring inherited silence. Sensory hierarchy (brine, lantern-light) filters through Nelle's runner bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart betrayal) tightens via agency-driven reveal—"She pressed play"—foreclosing violence with mutual deterrence cost. Shadows reposition as coherent pressure under causal lens; tradeoff charges sunrise deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of volatile trust emerges implicitly from fob/recorder reprise to "We always were," reweighting hush as armor without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to betrayal's price through charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (runner-honed silence) biases details; dialogue carries subtext—"Your daddy was a good man"—pursuing goals amid natural rhythms. Rhythmic control heightens recorder playback tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax—no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; "The market seemed to hold its breath" integrates sensory propulsion without overwriting. Read-aloud rhythm varies perfectly with pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonshine heritage, antique fob, and nascent recording tech transforms Prohibition tropes; conceptual risk in quiet truce lands stakes via "silence like armor." Non-obvious pirate market angle elevates ingenuity.</comment>
