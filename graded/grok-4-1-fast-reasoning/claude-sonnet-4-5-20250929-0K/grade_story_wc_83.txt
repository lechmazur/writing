<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in geode rotation and sensor mods rooted in loss; internal endurance earns closure stance. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "unfiltered awakening" borders unearned but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to anomaly detection; CR closure in final search image carries endurance cost, legible in "continued searching" amid breakers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost-rimed windows, clicking breakers, and geode constrain hunt choices; auroras/geode mirror internal potential, charging final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Anomaly tightens dominant stake of potential-hunt via thruster shift; agency in instrument refinement forecloses inaction with felt isolation cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode/perturbation images yield resonant CR on loss-as-pooling potential; final hunt reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature blending quantum lyricism and precision; Vahedi dialogue subtextual, voice-modulated rhythm heightens data surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via breaker refrain and refracted light; zero loops, syntactic variety aligns with emotional cadence in anomaly beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantum grief via perturbation/geode synthesizes fresh angle on loss; risk in abstract-concept grounding feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
