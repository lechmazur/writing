<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in obsession to bridge generations; repairing the music box embodies struggle and micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance of vagrant life earns purpose with felt cost of isolation. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density builds from loft survey to repair to sharing, culminating in CR closure where final climb reconfigures "wreckage of her fall" with conceptual cost of sweetened absence. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via box repair narrows to public test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dunes loft and jars constrain salvaged existence and charge jars' glow/crowd reaction; sensory details (salt, wild roses, ink-stained fingers) filter through poetic POV, evolving with action. Music box as micro-setting mirrors internal states and guides repair/share choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vanishing sounds) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via repair success enabling capture/share; agency in poem-recital and gifting forecloses isolation with cost of public vulnerability legible in crowd's "lonesome splendor." No reversal beyond one deepening, but pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into bridges emerges from jars/method/particulars, not statement; final image non-literally answers generational silence with "purpose salvaged," reweighting premise without moralizing. Mrs. Chen's recognition adds resonant irony from concrete events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with poetic perceptual signature ("sound was memory made physical"); diction/rhythm modulate from introspective to charged crowd scene. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, advances recognition without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyricism ("dawn arriving like forgiveness"); minor figurative density in opening risks overwriting but integrates without muddling closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion strong to final jingle image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jars as physical memory transforms vagrant poet trope; jars/method/obsession feel inevitable, with risk-taking in "impossible" mechanics heightening ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
