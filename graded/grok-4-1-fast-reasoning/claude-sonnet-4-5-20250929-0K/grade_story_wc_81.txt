<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical calm and quickening pulse act in scene, earning the final renewed purpose with visible cost in ironic dedication; interiority concrete via embodied reactions like pulse and lamp shadows. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: stamp discovery cascades to journal cross-reference pattern, culminating in CR closure ("marking her own beginning") with conceptual cost of drowned rebellion repriced as renewal; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Treacherous floor and dripping water constrain navigation, charging final image of "water-pressed wisdom"; sensory hierarchy reflects indexer's priorities, integrating purposefully without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through pattern emergence narrowing indifference; agency in methodical pulls forecloses complacency with felt excitement cost in blackout pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved truth amid erasure emerges organically via stamp/journal particulars, final stamp press reweighting premise non-literally without moralizing; resonance from blackout irony lingers with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density advances multiple layers per line without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels via ear test, minor figurative density in discoveries purposeful and unstrained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken archaeology trope via underground press reveal transforms into intellectual risk; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, bold quiet climax heightens stakes.</comment>
