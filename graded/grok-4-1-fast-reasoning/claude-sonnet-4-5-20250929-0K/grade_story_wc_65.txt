<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as ignorance cartographer intensifies through the writing process, with micro-choices like rewriting flagged prose revealing grounded traits; embodied details like hand cramping add specificity, though internal contradictions act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ascent to writing to descent; Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly in the glowing vellum and final lake-step image, with legible cost in sustained effort ("hand cramped"); orientation anchored early, one tightening via model flags.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain ascent/descent choices and charge the final image of stepping onto the lake; sensory details (reflections, hum, warmth) filtered through cartographer's priorities integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of writing a prevailing future tightens accumulatively via model corrections narrowing wishful paths; agency in rewriting forecloses easy fantasy with felt cost (hours, cramp), charging dawn closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance-mapping enabling innovation emerges organically from particulars like glyphs and model tests; final image of "map forward" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting blind spots, with ambiguity in messy progress lingering honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with cartographer's perceptual signature in glyph-tracing and probability-weaving; rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory ("moment before the pen meets") to poised closure without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., quill dip advances tech/motif); minor repetition of "obsidian/ignorance" purposeful but borders loop in mid-writing; rhythm varies for propulsion, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, quill-tech, and ignorance-councils transforms prophecy trope through data-grounded imagination; risk in non-causal accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
