<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carta’s obsession rooted in father’s anchor drives micro-choices like offering the chain, earning final shared gesture; contradictory old/new navigation impulses act in scene with visible cost of forsaken academy life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final paragraph’s tracing of constellation; conceptual cost of unfolded unknowns legible in “horizons had unfolded into something vast and terrible and beautiful.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic trench edge and impossible starlight constrain perception and charge final image; chain link glows under pressure, mirroring internal shift through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of impossible navigation deepens via alien’s demonstration, narrowing old methods under Accumulative lens; cost felt in perceptual transformation charging final shared action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final shared tracing and warming chain reweight premise of boundaries between realities without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars like light’s “remembering.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with navigation-biased perceptual signature (“edge geometry” phrasing); alien dialogue distinct in translated idiom, subtext advances without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to crisp final image (“chain link grew warm”); no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like “water-memories” cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>“Light remembers its origin” and edge geometry synthesize fresh alien navigation, transforming tropes; bold physics risk heightens stakes, inevitable at shared closure gesture.</comment>
