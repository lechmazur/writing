<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between Academy logic and sentimental intuition acts in scene via trembling fingers reaching for crystal and trusting starlings; final harmonization earned by prior starling observation and handkerchief anchor. Minor epiphanic polish at "science and sentiment were never opposites" lacks embodied cost in that line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to crystal grasp, orchard shudder, starlings' patterns, to CR closure in glowing vial and following birds reweighting premise; cost legible in "either succeed or consume her" persisting as felt risk. Orientation anchors early via waterfall push; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory orchard (prismatic cascade, dew freeze, trees singing) constrains via simultaneous seasons yielding crystal and guides climax experiment on flat stone; final starlings braid charges image. POV-filtered through alchemical priorities (instruments clink, blue flame intention).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Opus completion) signaled early, deepens via starlings revealing "final sequence" under Accumulative lens, forcing intuition-trust micro-choice with consumption risk; cost felt in trembling reach and orchard shudder narrowing to success trade-off. Entry 8-band via live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of logic-intuition harmony emerges implicitly from starlings (chaos/order), crystal (liquid/solid), handkerchief (beakers/roses); final vial glow and starlings reweight premise non-literally as "always harmonized." No moralizing; complexity in Academy tension lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (impossible geometries, living calligraphy) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks at starlings "intricate braids," compression purposeful and taught early via orchard contradictions. No head-hopping; diction alchemist-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "mixture began to glow" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("glass bells and ancient languages") during peak but coherent and voice-motivated; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical quest with starling intuition guiding formula transforms tropes organically; risk in sentimental defiance of Academy heightens stakes to inevitable CR without gimmick. Starlings' dual backstory/climax role feels non-obvious.</comment>
