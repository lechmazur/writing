<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between practical collection and mystery pull act in boot removal hesitation; dive choice earned by psychometry visions of Henrik with embodied vial tremble cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from descent density to charged poise CR at dive; compass stilling on shore delivers legible conceptual cost of certainty's unmaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent lagoon constrains wade/dive choices via resonant hush and petrichor; final water-to-lips immersion charges closure image with tactile inevitability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Psychometry crash at water edge tightens mystery stake under textural lens, narrowing options to dive; agency in deliberate immersion forecloses surface return with felt certainty loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Factory certainty vs. lagoon strangeness emerges implicitly through vial fill and dive; final primordial breath image non-literally reweights theme toward irreducible mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory-perceptual signature (mineral breath, petrichor) biases narration to Mara's collector lens; rhythmic compression heightens under dive pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High-density lines layer scent/stone propulsion without loops; "water received her like recognition" varies rhythm to peak dive clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory psychometry transforms lost-explorer trope into scent-memory pursuit; quiet CR dive risks bold synthesis of petrichor/geology for fresh inevitability.</comment>
