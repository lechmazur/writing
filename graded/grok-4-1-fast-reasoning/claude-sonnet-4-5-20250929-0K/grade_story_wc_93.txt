<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in trembling hands amid visions urging completion, earning the final placement with visible cost of renunciation; interiority particular via pattern-seeing curse. Grandmother's promise anchors motivation without unearned epiphany. Final understanding feels character-bound, foreclosing restoration path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rock placements build density to CR closure ("she finally understood the sacred geometry of letting go") with conceptual cost of acceptance. Orientation anchored by para 1 (Korin, bluff, frictionless world). One tightening via escalating visions narrows to invitation over reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frictionless eels gliding in tide pools constrain herding, forcing star dust gravity wells; aurora aligns with 17th stone, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (frequencies as colors). Details tactile (dust settles like fog with weight), integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode or eels disperse) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stone-by-stone visions changing knowledge to letting go. Agency in placements forecloses restoration with felt cost in final convergence. Pressure coheres to cadence shift at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically via pattern-building to CR ("universe remembering itself"); final eels' song reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in grandmother's promise as invitation, not explanation. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (futures in colors, spirals everywhere); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating from certainty to revelation. Syntax reflects mind under curse (premonition phrasing). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "eels sang mathematics" advances closure image). Varied rhythm, no loops despite pattern repetition (Fibonacci purposeful). Minor figurative density in peak ("bioluminescence in deep water") coherent, pattern-taught; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, precog curse, eel geometry transforms tropes; risk in lyric sci-fantasy pays off at CR. Irreplaceable premise (star dust anchors) inevitable in hindsight. Bold conceptual commitment heightens stakes.</comment>
