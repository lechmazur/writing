<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's interiority concretely embodies her loose grip on reality during the supply run, with contradictory solace in endings driving micro-choices like volunteering over clinic; final endurance earned by prior village experiences with visible cost of staying. Doctor applies relational pressure without dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: volunteering shards build density toward CR closure in final realization/image, reweighting premise with cost of impermanence; orientation anchored by ~100 words, multi-shard pattern taught early via volunteering cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and ice floes constrain choices (boat navigation, village aid) and charge final dissolution image; sensory selection (salt/diesel hum, glowing homes) POV-biased toward endings, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand hum/endings) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via village deliveries forcing realization; agency in postponing clinic forecloses path with felt cost of seasonal commitment, no live option left untested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-solace emerges from parasol/village particulars, final image non-literally reweights "death calling" premise without moral; earned resonance avoids platitudes via conflicted listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (translucent world, low hum) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual (Henriksen's "permission?" probes stakes), rhythmic prose modulates with quiet intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (parasol tip smoothing via grips), varied rhythm propels without loops; final line recharges opening motif purposefully, zero scaffolds in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tumor perception, heirloom amid ice, volunteering as perceptual tactic transforms death trope; quiet CR risks bold lyricism, inevitable in hindsight via hum's accumulative reweight.</comment>
