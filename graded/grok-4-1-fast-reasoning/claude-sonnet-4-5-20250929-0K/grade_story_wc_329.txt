<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to reawaken beauty drives consistent micro-choices like tucking the locust shell and playing through the violin's crack, with embodied emotion in the orchard pulse. Internal conflict emerges in the desperate idea amid mechanical oppression. Final endurance of playing despite breakage earns the transformation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from subtle reactions to orchard stirring and blooming. Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page in "continuous becoming" with violin-cracking cost legible in "She didn't stop playing." Orientation anchored early in sky-bridge twilight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky-bridge and orchard vividly constrain choices: slipping past statues pressures entry, locust shell as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details like "gray branches creaked" mirror internal decay, evolving causally to gold-weeping statues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reawaken beauty tightens accumulatively via spreading melody narrowing mechanical stasis. Protagonist agency in weaving the pulse-signal forces statue/orchard reconfiguration; violin breakage visible cost charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from locust shell and music uproots, reweighting mechanical repetition. Final image of "thousand hearts beating to a rhythm older than any machine" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic, symbolic noticing like "pulse she'd felt in the orchard." Lyrical diction modulates intensity, prose texture distinct and pressure-aligned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk decay and organic magic via heart-rhythm signaling transforms tropes. Risky lyric escalation to city-wide bloom feels inevitable from shell motif.</comment>
