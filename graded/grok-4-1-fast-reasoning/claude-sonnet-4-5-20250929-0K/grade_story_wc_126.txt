<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's acoustic perception and motivation to play unfinished pieces reveal contradictory impulses (confidence dissolving into questions) acting in scene, earning the final realization of living quiet with emotional cost in tears and shared fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: performances and stories build density, culminating in Charged Poise closure where hush retreats and fruit drop sounds "magnificently clear," reweighting the burned world with conceptual cost of persistent incompleteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse's gray water and sideways apples constrain platform choice and charge final fruit-drop image; shipwrecks resonate with notes, mirroring defiance and integrating sensory hierarchy through Maya's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake against chronic hush tightens accumulatively at twenty-seventh piece ("something shifted"), forcing deepened family sharing; agency in playing forecloses tidy completion, with felt cost in ash-dusted tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically from unfinished pieces leaving "space for...stories," answered non-literally by living quiet and fruit drop reweighting hush without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with acoustic perceptual signature ("harmonics in rainfall"); minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Great-Aunt Sora left us forty-three pieces"); rhythmic control heightens resonance without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("water carrying vibrations through submerged roots"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts; purposeful lyricism like "sideways through the flooded foundation" serves closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire hush, unfinished music, and sunken greenhouse transforms apocalypse trope into defiant persistence; risk in lyric accumulative drive feels inevitable via fruit-drop repricing.</comment>
