<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Uncertain alchemist's doubt ("uncertain whether she possessed the skill or merely the desperation") acts simultaneously with desperate trials, earning final commitment to mapping as contradictory impulses resolve in descent with visible cost of prior surfacing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of pockmark trials building to resonant click at "forty-fifth pockmark," delivering Charged Poise closure in golden map realization with oxygen-debt cost legible on surfacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acid sea workshop constrains choices via tilting waves and breath timer, with statue pockmarks as recurring micro-setting charging final luminous map image.</comment>
