<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's pyramid scheme backstory anchors motivation and micro-choices like texting back and pressing the bolt, showing interior contradiction between past shame and new curiosity. Virtuous mischief is embodied in surviving Marcel while planning escape, compelling the volunteer act. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("virtuously mischievous") slightly abstracts a trait best shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: glitchy texts cause volunteer reply, therefore bolt materializes and seals breach as on-page Decisive Change with felt cost in the bolt's "impossibly heavy" weight of depths. Single scene oriented early in farm with who/when clear. Closure Charged Poise in diamond image reconfigures past pressure into promise, cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms as setting constrain discovery (intensify to reveal breach) and charge closure (erupt in symphonic brilliance framing diamonds). Sensory hierarchy via Mira's tactile "quantum hum" and biased notice of "shadow in seventeen directions" integrates purposefully. Micro-setting (bolt, clusters) guides pivotal seal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to translate pressure (personal debt/breach) signaled early via texts, escalates causally through bolt's arrival narrowing to install choice foreclosing parallel bleed. Agency in volunteer/press tests commitment with trade-off cost in endured "crushing weight." One tightening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-to-diamond emerges organically from particulars (pyramid survival, bolt seal) without statement, resonant in final diamond refracting "possibility into spectrum" as non-literal answer reweighting premise. Subtext in parallel Miras' chorus invites ambiguity on transformation's cost. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in poetic bias toward "hidden poetry" of rules and quantum textures. Voice modulates rhythm for wonder-to-resolution, diction purposeful (e.g., "probability threads"). Texts as "goal-driven" advance causal chain without naturalism issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm breathes with scene (short sentences at seal). Figurative density in opener ("seventeen directions") purposeful for textural lens but borders overwrite in peak seal beat, slightly muddling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum bolt sealing dimensional breach synthesizes pyramid pressure with parallel texts into fresh, inevitable transformation; risk in surreal logic heightens stakes without gimmick. Final diamond as "probabilities made solid" reconfigures tropes organically.</comment>
