<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to sculpt possibility drives her from observation to playing, with embodied emotion (luminous disbelief in veins) and micro-choice to translate code into melody earning the closure endurance. Minor epiphanic summary ("she understood") slightly undercuts internal contradiction in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from vanishing to flake, code, and playing, culminating in on-page RR (Charged Poise) as figures resolve with aching arm cost; orientation anchors immediately at pullout post-vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of pullout gravel, scaffold wrap, and valley light constrains choices (flake found, code observed) and charges final image (wrap stills, flake dissolves); sensory hierarchy via fiddler's observant bias integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging anomaly escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing to music as agency, with visible cost (aching arm) charging closure; one tightening (code translation) forecloses inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty emerges organically from particulars (hitchhiker words, flake pixels, figures resolving), with final image reweighting bridge-song premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in Mara's onward drive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (dynamically observant noticing flake/code) and rhythmic modulation under playing pressure; no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated specifics; minor overwriting in "photons dancing, quantum vibration" slightly muddles peak resolution beat without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of analog fiddling granting digital amnesty transforms trope of vanishing stranger; risk-taking in pixel-glass hybrid heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
