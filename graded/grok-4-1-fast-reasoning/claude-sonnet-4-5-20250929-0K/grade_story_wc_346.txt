<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and interiority in "hands trembling" and "bruised awe," with endurance of burden earning closure cost; flaw shown via puppet dialogue personifying isolation. Minor slip: subtle contradictory impulses lack simultaneous action in peak adjustment beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure in "bruised awe" line, with legible cost in "ache of responsibility"; orientation anchored early in climb, single scene tightens meaningfully at mechanism hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Puppet head and fractal waves as micro-settings constrain choice (rolls free, watches) and charge final cradle image; sensory integration mirrors nested patterns purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (3-min adjustment with reversal seeds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timeline perception deepening options; cost unmistakable in "familiar bruised awe" crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of flawed soothing emerges organically from particulars like puppet witness and lullaby weave; final "whispered lullaby threaded through probability" reweights premise non-literally with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mathematical poetry" and hush filters POV stably; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in adjustment without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in mechanism sequence, varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwrite in repeated "nested patterns" purposeful but borders loop without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Doomsday Clock literalized via probability hush transforms tropes; risk in abstract patterns pays off inevitably at "seeds of reversal" reconfiguration.</comment>
