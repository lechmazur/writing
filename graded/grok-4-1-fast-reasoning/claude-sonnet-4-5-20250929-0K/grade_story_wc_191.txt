<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaida's motivation as lore keeper intensifies credibly from research to action, with embodied emotions like "pulse quicken" and "warm as blood" grounding her wisely adventurous trait; micro-choices like kneeling to press palms reveal values under time pressure. Limited internal conflict—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal moments like lifting the flake—prevents 9+ entry, but final descent feels earned without unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (mural → rail-bike journey → waterfall → flake → throne activation); orientation anchors who/where/when by para 1. Closure is on-page Decisive Change in "glass began to shift... revealing steps that descended into light," with felt cost in "first rays of orbital sunrise" forcing descent. No ambiguity or unkept setups touch the pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "fiber-optic threads cascading... cool against her skin" and "bark etched with circuit-like grooves" filter through historian's priorities, constraining choices (pushing through light, palms on glass). Environment charges final image: throne floor peels "like paint beneath her scanner's pulse," mirroring opening and reweighting ascent as descent. No white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate stairway before sunrise) signals early and tightens via flake's knowledge shift ("not climbing to power, but... serving memory"), narrowing options with agency-driven reversal. Cost legible in time pressure altering tactics ("she ran") and conceptual price at climax. Single meaningful escalation suffices; no abstract or untested stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ascension as "diving deeper into the truth beneath empire's painted facades" emerges organically from particulars (peeling paint → glass layers → descent), with final image offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in images like "throne... never meant to be sat upon" reweights power motif. No tidy binaries or overt statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: historian's lens on "centuries of paint" and "dead languages." Prose texture varies rhythmically ("hummed beneath her like a lullaby" to short climax sentences), modulating with intensity; no head-hopping or withholdings. Voice coheres as reflective yet propulsive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ruby flake suspended... casting red shadows" advances plot/atmosphere); varied syntax/paragraphs propel without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "kaleidoscopic waterfall" purposeful and uncluttered in peaks. Zero artifacts dull closure image of "steps that descended into light."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi tropes (orbital mirrors, dimension-folded orchard) via "futuristic nostalgia" and twist on ascension (downward stairs), transforming throne/power archetype through lived historian's choices. Risky conceptual pivot feels inevitable from peeling-paint motif; no derivative templates.</comment>
