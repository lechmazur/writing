<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in unpacking sketchbook over resignation letter, revealing fear-rooted impulses acting simultaneously; final choice to apprentice at 37 earned by embodied hand-trembling steadying into true sketch, with visible cost of mockery/hardship. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival/whisper to crystal hum and dawn-sketch CR, reweighting abandonment as preserved dream with conceptual cost of prior buried ideas; orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, closure cost legible in lighter satchel image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystals constrain whisper-test choice and charge final fade-to-stillness image; petrichor, damp stone, dawn threads filter through inventor bias, evolving with sketch; micro-setting (courtyard/tools) mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) signaled early, tightens via hum-reversal deepening knowledge of honoring over forgetting; agency in sketch forecloses passive transcription path with felt cost of beginner hardship at 37; coherent pressure under accumulative lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of acknowledging vs. abandoning emerges organically from sketchbook ghosts to true clock-face image reweighting prior designs; resonant non-literal answer in "depending on which dream you were chasing," embracing contradiction without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with clock-perceptual signature ("suspended time," "music box rhythm") modulates rhythmically under realization pressure; stable close-third POV, no elision or head-hopping; diction biases toward mechanisms, consistent to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Water droplets clung... suspended time" advances sense/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyric overwriting taught early pays off in charged poise; minor register elevation fits voice without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-transcriber/inventor in crystal-echo sanctuary transforms dream-abandonment trope via heartbeat/backward mechanisms and simple true clock; risk in lyric hush-to-conversation cadence heightens stakes organically.</comment>
