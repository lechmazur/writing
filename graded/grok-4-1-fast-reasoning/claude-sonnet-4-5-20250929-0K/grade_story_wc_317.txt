<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's receptivity to patterns drives contradictory impulses—curiosity versus protection—embodied in photographing the seed and database search, earning her refusal; final renunciation forecloses investigation path with business-preservation cost. Internal conflict acts simultaneously via recognition of sabotage amid obsession. No safety-hedging; flaws (curiosity trap) complicate peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: realizations density (botanical ID, failed designers) reweights sabotage premise, tightening to on-page closure via seed-drop RR (Earned Stasis) where brook carries it away, legible cost in foreclosed mystery ("some mysteries weren't meant to be solved"). Orientation anchored immediately (cottage, brook, night). Single scene, no shards, lens coherent to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook as micro-setting constrains choice (edge drop) and charges final image ("brook carried the seed away into... silence"); sensory hierarchy (murmur, thick air, moonlight) reflects puzzle-designer POV bias toward patterns. Details evolve (clouds part) via action; nocturnal isolation mirrors internal hush. Recurrent brook/water guides/reflects refusal.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard innovation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern-deepening (three failed designers, corpse flower demands) narrowing options to refusal/drop; agency in dropping forecloses curiosity path with felt cost (uninvestigated coordinates, but space protected). Moral calculus (curiosity as trap) sharpens peak; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (mysteries as sabotage traps) emerges organically from seed realization and refusal, resonant non-literal answer in final brook image reweighting premise (innovation via refusal, not pursuit). Subtext in orthogonal thinking praise shifts to business protection; lingering ambiguity (what if others trapped?) avoids tidy moral. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing: "orthogonal approaches that suddenly converged"); rhythmic modulation (short sentences at breath-catch) under realization pressure. Diction character-specific (puzzle metaphors: "final lock"); no elision, voice coherent/intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "Her breath caught" advances emotion/plot); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak (seed ID to drop). Minor overwriting in atmospheric phrases ("storm-born silence" reprise taught early); propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corpse flower as obsession-sabotage ingenious, transforms mystery trope via escape-room psychology; refusal ending fresh synthesis (protect via non-engagement). Risk in quiet stasis heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from pattern trait.</comment>
