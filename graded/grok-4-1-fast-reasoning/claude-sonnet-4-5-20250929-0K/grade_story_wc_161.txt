<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority via pigeon training memory linking to dust mapping, with contradictory impulses (flee vs. endure) embodied in chest-blooming instinct; final endurance earned by micro-choices like placing meteorite. Minor slip: last-paragraph epiphany edges tidy without full embodied cost in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust/meteorite/cylinder patterns tightens to RR closure (placing chip as "small anchor point" foreclosing flight with felt cost of natural withering). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust motes and skylight constrain perception (mapping currents) and charge final image, mirroring internal states through selective sensory weave (leather/dust smell, light pillar). Meteorite as micro-setting recurs to anchor closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reinvent/flight vs. trust/preserve) signaled early, Accumulative escalation via pattern-deepening (dust to honest cataloging) narrows options to Charged Poise endurance; cost legible in "withering... natural, seasonal" but one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. erasure emerges organically from particulars (paper trails, meteorite endurance); final image non-literally reweights opposites-needed premise ("dust continued... Clara continued") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (air currents mapping in dust/light); rhythmic diction modulates reflectively, prose texture distinct without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful recurrence (dust/paper trails) propels without loops; minor reflective telling strategic for compression, no artifacts dulling closure image of meteorite placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeons/meteorite/cylinders transforms reinvention trope via dust-mapping perception; risk in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
