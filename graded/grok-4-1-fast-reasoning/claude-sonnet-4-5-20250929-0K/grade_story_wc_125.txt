<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's reverence for the rope as metaphor evolves into arranging the mandala, earning his final "passionate certainty" through embodied micro-choices; Sarah's flickering presence tests his witness role without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rope examination builds density to mandala and Sarah's appearance, delivering Charged Poise closure in the shrine-leaving image with legible cost of ongoing wandering; orientation anchored early by Route 9 and grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope fibers and clay floor constrain mandala action and charge final glowing shrine; starlight threads and warm walls mirror temporal leakage purposefully, filtering through poet's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering meaning tightens texturally via 17 temporal layers to Sarah's validation, narrowing interpretive options; cost felt in foreclosing possession by leaving the rope, though stakes lean observational over visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final shrine and walking-on image reweight impossible choices into "bearing witness" as courage, emerging organically from rope particulars without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in Sarah's infinite smile lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with poetic perceptual signature ("time leaked at the edges," "molecules aligned by terror"); Sarah's multi-directional voice advances subtext via implication, rhythm modulating to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (rope pulsing like narrative resonance) and propel to "glowing faintly under stars," varying rhythm without overwriting in peak mandala beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-arrival world where matter narrates time's texture, transforming escape trope via rope mandala into transcendence witness; risk in subtle energy beings' lyricism heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
