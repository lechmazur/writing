<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margot's motivation to reclaim hearts drives clear micro-choices like repurposing the door and noting grief textures, earning communal shift; townspeople like Maria add pressure via trembling hands. Minor dilution from crowd limits deeper internal contradiction, e.g., no shown hesitation in her calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tentative arrivals to bold sketches, tightening to Charged Poise closure in "broken things bloomed" with conceptual cost of transmuting loss. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory mix (lavender fragrance, metallic tang, vines climbing) mirrors transformation, constraining linger and charging final ruins-as-beginnings image; rusted beams as "broken teeth" to arches guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective arc-completion signaled early, escalates accumulatively via trembling to "wings and stars," narrowing grief options with visible cost in imagined gardens over defeat; communal agency forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal resilience emerges implicitly via shared drawings shifting arcs' meaning, resonant in final dusk walk reweighting factory ruins without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (noting grief shades); voice modulates whimsy to calm, dialogue sparse/natural like "I've brought stories" advances invitation; rhythmic control under group pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors like "purple sea hold them" propel without muddle, even in peak drawing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of therapy-as-art in ruined factory/lavender, transforming grief tropes via photo arcs; risk in communal scale heightens stakes organically.</comment>
