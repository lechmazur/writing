<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of sensory perception through skin as concrete interiority; grief motivation intensifies via sister's hummed melody recognition, earning final realization with conceptual cost of inhabiting loss. Contradictory impulses (mapping grief as foreign vs. home) act in scene through dowsing choices. No safety-hedging flaws; voice-specific struggle persists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to foreign note trail as pattern break, culminating in CR closure ("grief wasn't an unmapped void... but a territory to inhabit") with undeniable conceptual cost in final kneeling image. Orientation anchored early (blind Sera in ancient woodland). Single tightening via melody trail suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest specificities (chiropteran frequencies, moth-wing percussion) constrain path and charge final earth-palm image; POV-filtered hierarchy (skin over sight) evolves with translucency. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring emotional mapping. Environment guides dowsing choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping grief via stillpoint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via note trail deepening recognition; agency in skin-absorption/dowsing forecloses evasion with cost of grief acceptance. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in pause-between-heartbeats. One tightening reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-territory emerges organically from sensory mapping parallels, reweighted non-literally in final image ("maps... drawn in the language of absence"). No moralizing; resonance from particulars like sister's melody amid forest dialects. Complexity lingers in inhabitation cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (skin as translator of ultrasonic dialects); rhythmic lyricism modulates to compressed intensity at ring-pulse/rod-stillness. Purposeful compression taught early via frequencies pays off in closure cadence. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (languages blooming on skin) supports accumulative propulsion; rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony. Minor overwriting in sensory metaphors risks coherence mid-beat ("new languages bloomed"), but closure image clear. Zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dowsing/ultrasonics/grief-mapping transforms sensory tropes into emotional CR; skin-absorption risks bold perceptual ingenuity, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Premise inevitable in hindsight via mentor's "music beneath the music."</comment>
