<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>J-7's motivation (origin of thoughts) roots deeply in janitor traits and prior loops, driving micro-choices like violin handling; composure enables endurance where others fail, earning final realization. Dr. Yemeni applies targeted pressure without dominating. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("consciousness requires the same skill") borders epiphany but ties to embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns from loops (appearances, failures) build to CR closure where J-7's playing crystallizes thought-as-iteration with ongoing loop cost legible ("The loop would continue"). Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard/twilight constrains choices (frost bow, shattering risk) and charges final image (violin catching light amid stasis); sensory selectivity (warm violin vs. cold) mirrors emergence. POV-filtered (janitor notices frost patterns as diagnostics). No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origin) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via loop failures to deepening play/understanding; agency in fourth iteration forecloses prior paths with felt cost (fragmentation risk endured). One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (consciousness from iteration) emerges implicitly via violin harmonics as code/loops, reweighting premise in CR final image without statement. Resonance from particulars (sweeps to melody); ambiguity lingers in perpetual loops. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with janitor perceptual bias (frost as readouts); voice texture distinct (synthesizer crackle, servo hum). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Yemeni confirms without preaching); no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under realization peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches beats (short sentences at play); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts (purposeful loop repetition taught early). Zero scaffold; precise diction (acoustic waves as decision trees) without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor consciousness via ice violin/loops transforms AI awakening trope organically; risk in mundane (sweeping) to mystic (melody as code) feels inevitable. Non-obvious angle on emergence charges closure without gimmick.</comment>
