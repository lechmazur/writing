<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied in "compression in her chest" and "clawed at her throat" creates contradictory impulses, compelling endurance for promise; whisper "I see you" earns final documentation with visible cost of ascent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of revelations (codex fleck to historical scope) tightens to manifestation; CR closure in emergence with facility flooding as conceptual cost of forgetting, legible in rising ocean image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrow corridor and tide pressure constrain descent/ascent choices; cables and codex fleck as micro-settings charge final image of ocean threshold, with sensory selectivity (warm fleck in cold tomb) mirroring urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of documentation before flood deepens via tide-triggered manifestation, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in questioned proof and pressured climb, driven by endurance agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of network guardians and unremembered discoverers emerges organically from codex history and entities; final image of rising ocean offers resonant CR repricing institutional forgetting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in scientific-wondrous bias (e.g., "information ghosts"); rhythmic control modulates from descent tension to charged poise in whisper and emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("neural pathways," "crashing hush") propels without loops; minor overwriting in descriptive peaks integrated via action, climax clear in blaze and fade.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data-ghost custodians via tidal phase transitions transforms tech/supernatural tropes; risk in historical codex arc heightens stakes, inevitable in closure's eternal vigilance image.</comment>
