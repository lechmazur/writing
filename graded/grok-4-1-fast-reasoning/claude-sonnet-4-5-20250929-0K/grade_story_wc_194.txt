<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in penance drives micro-choices like picking the crank; interiority concrete in engineering recognition; earned change at recording's end forecloses partial-truth stance with reparations cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: intuition to crank to waves builds density to CR closure; on-page cost legible in "this changed everything" realization reweighting dynasty knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gramophone and crank as micro-setting constrain discovery choice and charge final silent image; sensory details (vanilla dust, brass light) selective via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early, deepens via recording under accumulative lens with knowledge shift narrowing reparations options; cost felt in fuller "weight of destruction."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silences as testimony emerges via particulars like journal gaps and waves; final "bridge held" image resonantly reweights intuition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (engineering lens on mechanism); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; recording voice natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; purposeful poetic phrasing like "golden shadows" without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of encoded historical confession via standing waves transforms family secrets trope; risk in technical intuition pays off at CR.</comment>
