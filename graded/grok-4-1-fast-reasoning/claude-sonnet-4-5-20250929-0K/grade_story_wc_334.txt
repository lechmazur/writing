<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chronically curious trait drives research to dive and pivotal pluck despite protocols; embodied hesitation "This was when habits broke" reveals contradiction with felt cost in closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as research/memory density builds to pluck-triggered flood and CR closure; cost legible in "habits break" realization and living memory ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse ribs and shipwrecks constrain fairy ring as anchor, mirroring preservation theme; final "circling guardians" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to recover memories tightens via pluck reversal flooding shared past; agency in gathering forecloses hoarding with conceptual reclamation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Preservation vs. transformation emerges organically from ritual/mushrooms; "memory... spoils when hoarded" realization reweights without stating, resonating in living memory image.</comment>
