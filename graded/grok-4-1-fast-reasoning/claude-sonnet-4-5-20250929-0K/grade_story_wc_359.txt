<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's synesthetic perception and motivation to prove wonder's necessity drive concrete micro-choices like holding the sheet and striking the ice, with embodied sensations (frost-numbed fingers, copper tastes) revealing character under pressure. Internal realization at climax earns her endurance without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from entry to hush's unfolding and final CR in "the sculpted hush... had saved them all," reweighting disbelief's binding cost legibly on-page; single scene oriented early, pattern holds to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern's organ-pipe columns and aurora-bent light constrain actions (sheet held higher, hammer strike) and charge final tonal image; synesthetic sensory hierarchy (tasted copper, violet threads) filters purposefully through Mira's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder to save bells) signaled early tightens accumulatively via precise chisel-moment alignment and hush's unfolding, forcing stance crystallization with felt proof-cost in recordings; minor abstractness in initial threat dilutes visceral peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as sustenance emerges organically from hush's liberation and final CR repricing bells as revealers of latent awe, resonant via aurora-sheet image without moralizing; complexity lingers in beauty's binding by disbelief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (colors bloom from silence, whispers as violet threads) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic lyric voice modulates intensity to closure's oscillating poise without slippage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively, but figurative density (crystalline absence, flower of mirrors) borders overwriting in pre-climax build without obscuring cause-effect; no loops, clean propulsion to strike moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic hush unfettered via aurora-sheet in ice cathedral transforms wonder's utility trope into fresh conceptual rule-set with irreplaceable premise; risk in abstract hush manifestation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
