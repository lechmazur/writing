<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation intensifies compellingly through embodied micro-choices like mapping vibrations; interiority concrete in "feeling the vibration travel up her arm." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, tilting toward competence without raw internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from insulator testing to collective harmonies; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with "hands trembling with exhaustion" as felt cost in birds' lingering presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Porcelain cracks and workshop tree constrain choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (vibration over sight) reflects symphonic bias. Grove evolves from silent witness to bird-filled possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect music) tightens via strumming beat under Accumulative lens, foreclosing failure with exhaustion cost; agency in precise touches drives birds' return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from breakage emerges organically via cracks-to-song progression; final birds' gaze offers resonant answer reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vibration-feeling; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet focus to shimmering overtones without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "frozen symphonies" cohere without muddle. Minor figurative density in testing beats risks slight overwriting but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of porcelain stress cracks as instruments transforms post-apocalyptic silence trope; risk in lyric accumulative build heightens symphonic payoff inevitability.</comment>
