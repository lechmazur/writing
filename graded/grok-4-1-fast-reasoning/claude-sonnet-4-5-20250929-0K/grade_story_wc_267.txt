<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in painful nerve sparks versus determined play earn final choice; Silent-Choir's deliberate silence reveals character through gesture, not exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from staircase dust to piano chord; CR closure lands on-page as shared-cost realization with regenerating nerves as felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Broken piano bench bolt recurs to constrain play and mirror trauma, charging final image; snow and arrow slits filter POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silent-Choir's bolt-to-chest gesture deepens stake under accumulative lens, forcing trade-off realization; cost legible in embodied nerve ache during anthem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Anthem play offers non-literal answer to safety's shared price, reweighting silence motif from isolation to grace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile numbness; rhythm modulates from weighted climb to resonant hum, eliding noise purposefully.</comment>
