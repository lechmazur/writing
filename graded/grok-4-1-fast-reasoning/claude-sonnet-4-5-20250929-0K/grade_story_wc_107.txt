<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's embodied pause thumbing the bookmark's spine reveals contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) acting simultaneously; final micro-choice to pocket it and plan outreach earns relational renunciation with clear cost, satisfying 9+ test without slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered glassblowing narration building to Charged Poise closure ("He tucked the bookmark... decision forming like glass cooling"); cost legible in "afraid that reaching out might shatter," reconfiguring isolation with undeniable opportunity price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Control room's "abandoned panels and switches... audience of ghosts" and ice "groans and split[s]" constrain solitary choices while charging final repurposing image; micro-setting (pontil rod, tools) integrates purposefully, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Internal stake (thaw frozen relations) signaled early via bookmark deepens accumulatively through metaphor beats ("glass, like trust, collapses"); agency in release forecloses stasis path with legible cost in outreach fear, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of release-for-transformation emerges organically from glass/ice/bookmark particulars, culminating in resonant non-literal answer ("endings contain beginnings") via river-free image reweighting prior fracture lines without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "dust motes into constellations," ice as "breaking glass") biases toward thawing metaphors; rhythmic modulation ("thoughtfully spirited" narration) controls pressure to closure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful glass/ice metaphors propels accumulatively ("flame kisses glass"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddle, though minor figurative density in narration ("weighty lightness") prevents perfect 9+; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glassblowing in dam control room synthesizes abandonment/reclamation ingeniously, transforming reconciliation trope via "thawing heart" particulars; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern, with risk-taking in solo lyric drive.</comment>
