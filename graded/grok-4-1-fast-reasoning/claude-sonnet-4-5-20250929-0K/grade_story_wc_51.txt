<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (physical freedom vs. recursive weaving compulsion) act vividly in scene, earning the closure realization as she becomes "the trap itself"; interiority embodied in blurring hands and drifting consciousness avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as burden density tightens to mandala, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure ("She understood now... becoming the trap itself") with legible cost in foreclosed patterns and elapsed seasons; orientation anchored in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze walls and starlight shafts constrain calcification angles, charging final mandala image; selective sensory hierarchy (acoustic "shingled hush," mineral rivulets) mirrors internal crystallization without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend multiplying patterns via burden collection) deepens through accumulative density to stance crystallization, with agency in endurance and visible cost (hands still after three seasons, crystals left behind).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of oriented sorrow transforming into shining endurance emerges organically from crystallizing burdens, reweighted non-literally in closing stars image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with fractal-perceptual signature (recursive gestures blurring into infinity) and rhythmic modulation under pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied syntax propelling from descent to emergence; figurative language (e.g., "whalebone reverie") consistent and voice-motivated, no muddle in peak mandala beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal poetics and burden alchemy transforms reverie tropes into inevitable closure image of stars "freezing light... chosen to shine anyway"; risk-taking lyric structure heightens resonance.</comment>
