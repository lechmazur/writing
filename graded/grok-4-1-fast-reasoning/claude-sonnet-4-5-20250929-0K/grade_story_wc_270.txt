<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—resist Authority yet evolve tradition—act in decoding and unsealing, earning the spore integration with lifelong preparation as visible cost; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from kite script to cavern embryo, culminating in on-page RR (transformation via spores sinking into skin) with conceptual cost of symbiotic integration legible in "remained herself... now equipped".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs and cavern fungi constrain descent (off-limits) and charge final image ("hot springs steamed around her"); sensory details (sulfurous waters, iron air) filtered through Naja's plant-attuned POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition) tightens via plant crescendo forcing unsealing agency; cost unmistakable in spore absorption altering her forever without consuming identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of Naja walking to camps with "spores golden in her blood" offers resonant answer to tradition-vs-progress, reweighting embryo as symbiotic bridge without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (plant whispers as "root seeking water"); rhythmic control modulates from meditative to crescendoed voices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy transformation sentences vs. flowing descriptions), propulsion peaks cleanly in "dissolved into golden spores that sank into her skin".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insurgent elder + plant telepathy + genetic embryo transforms post-war tropes; kite-to-spores arc feels inevitable, risking bio-speculation that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
