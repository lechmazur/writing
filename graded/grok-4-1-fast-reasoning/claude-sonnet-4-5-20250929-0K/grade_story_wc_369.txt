<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment ("rain soaking through to her skin") and micro-choices under pressure (tool selection reveals curiosity); motivation intensifies through discoveries, earning final knowledge shift with conceptual cost; contradictory wonder (mundane duty vs. miraculous insight) acts in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup of mapped dreams to closure CR ("sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed"); orientation anchors immediately (pin, shift, labyrinth); on-page cost legible in final image of dissolved dreams nourishing seedlings, reweighting premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit tower and moonlight constrain choices (wet climb, dream-healing requires shaft of silver); sensory hierarchy (wind whipping, bark pulse) mirrors priorities; final fountain integrates setting into charged closure image, no white-room or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstruct twisted maze before dawn) signaled early, deepens via sextant mapping and extractions narrowing to healing revelation; agency in palm-to-bark contact forces trade-off (night labor in storm); cost unmistakable in time pressure and tree transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed longing emerges organically from quantified dreams and moonlight resolution, reweighting "scattered dreams" motif without statement; final image ("dissolved into water that would nourish new seedlings") offers non-literal answer to trees' role, embracing ambiguity of ongoing cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (quantified sorrow as "four-point-three units"); rhythmic control modulates from setup to peak extractions; purposeful lyric compression taught early ("crystallized on leaves like dew") pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "pruning shears that cut through probability"); varied rhythm accelerates through night work, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("lightning painted the walls silver") coherent and voice-motivated, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified dreams, broken sextant mapping, and mundane miracle maintenance transforms labyrinth trope; risk in poetic measurements ("three units of grief") heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from opening pin to closing realization.</comment>
