<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's motivation to decode the ghost's code intensifies through embodied micro-choices like note-playing responses and wading to stage; interiority particular via pattern-noticing bias, earning final commitment without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via lantern flickers and program stains to resonant reconfiguration when water swirls "TELL THEM"; on-page closure with conceptual cost of historical disruption legible in photographing beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flooded pit's water constrains wading/climbing while lantern light/acoustics charge decoding and final pooling image; sensory details (lapping water, resonant notes) filter through Marta's musical priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling murder code tightens accumulatively when Moretti emerges from stain, narrowing to disrupt-or-not via laying program; agency in photographing forecloses silence with history-challenging cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voicing the silenced emerges organically via lantern "conversations" and "I heard you" whisper; final house completion reweights in-between spaces without literal moral, embracing ghostly ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with musical perceptual signature (notes as signals, pulsing symbols); rhythmic modulation heightens revelation, no elision or distance slips under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action-atmosphere (e.g., "ink bleeding into strange new patterns"); varied rhythm propels without loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures, ear-test clean through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flood-as-acoustic-enhancer and water-reforming message transform haunted trope into musician-ghost synergy; fresh synthesis of decay/revelation feels inevitable, risking quiet closure payoff.</comment>
