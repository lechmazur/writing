<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preservation duty and loose witnessing act simultaneously in her shift from ordering texts to burrowing patiently; final vigil earned via swan discovery constraining old habits with embodied cost of self-dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of dissolution patterns tightening to swan-propelled descent; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "Everything that knows itself completely stops growing" with conceptual cost of halted growth felt in her smiling calcification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge's floor-as-door constrains burrowing choice; stalactite mineral script and dripping water charge final image, mirroring internal crumbling through tactile, POV-biased sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing without judgment deepens accumulatively via swan reversal narrowing preservation option; visible cost in self-becoming-archive charges final image without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dissolution-as-transition emerges organically from book-to-soil progression to her crumbling; final origami-reverse unfolding reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("silence pooled like water," "truth slip between her fingers like sand") biases toward regenerative patterns; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with intensity, elisions taught early for accumulative payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated motifs like crumbling without loops; figurative language ("stalactites...mineral script") coherent and pattern-taught, though dense in opening risks minor overwriting away from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dissolving library archive with origami geometry and self-calcification transforms forgotten-knowledge trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via loose-grip conceit inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
