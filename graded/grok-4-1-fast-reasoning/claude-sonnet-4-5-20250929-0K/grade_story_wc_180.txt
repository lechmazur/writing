<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Marta's defense of the contract versus admitting "machines see with precision, but hands see with mercy," earning the final joint grinding with relational cost paid in prior rift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: letter prompts climb to canopy confrontation, bag's stone triggers RR closure in blossoms on joined hands, reconfiguring rift with undeniable persistence cost; orientation anchored by window entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard-through-rafters constrains ladder climb and platforms, charging final blossoms on hands; sensory hierarchy (blossoms drifting, clink in bag) mirrors adaptive persistence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation via craft) signaled in ribbon talisman tightens accumulatively when Lena reveals gaps and stone enables joint work, foreclosing isolation with felt emotional price in softened expression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deciduous vows reweight from broken promises to adaptive core via trees' reconsecration, resonating non-literally in final ribbon flutter and blossom palm-catch without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable Marta-limited POV with perceptual bias (squinted at grinding stones); dialogue subtext-driven (Lena's flat "You came" vs. Marta's responsive demo), distinct voices in feisty interruptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in integrated details (oilcloth unwrap amid blossoms); no loops, rhythmic propulsion peaks in "blossoms fell through slanted light, landing on their joined hands."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard as reconsecrated craft-space transforms mother-daughter trope through quartz persistence, risking bold nature-over-architecture frame that charges closure organically.</comment>
