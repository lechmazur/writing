<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in rebellion against time/fate act through clock modifications and yoyo obsession, earning the final step into radiance with isolation's cost; interiority particular via "bleak exhilaration" sustained by work. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like madness drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure—Maren vanishes into light, reweighting fate's design with conceptual cost of obsolete stone and silent yoyo; orientation anchored early in stairs/tide; one tightening via yoyo bloom suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hunger stone constrains climax timing and charges final crack/image; lighthouse clocks chime reversal, mirroring internals; sensory hierarchy (tactile string, pulsing light) filters via Maren's inventive gaze, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse fate) signaled early, tightens via yoyo mod/spin under lens with agency in step forward; cost legible in body lightening and lighthouse abandonment, foreclosing isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reversed causality emerges via inscription shift ("When you see me, weep" to dissolving grammar), resonant CR in yoyo silence reweighting rebellion without moral; ambiguity lingers in transcendence/madness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (shifting symbols, 4D knots); rhythmic control modulates to compression in climax pull; diction biased to mechanisms, purposeful lyric elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short pulls in "light poured... inward"); metaphors cohere (unspool moments, drain water) without muddle in peak radiance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo as 4D time-reverser with hunger stone twist transforms tropes; risk in nonlinear causality pays off in charged poise of free motion "beyond fate's design."</comment>
