<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation intensifies convincingly from quiet inspiration to urgent transformation, rooted in embodied discoveries like the canyon echo; internal conflict emerges in her shift from preservation to active sharing. Crystallization at "Mara's motivation crystallized as the pattern emerged" earns the closure choice with felt cost against oblivion. Minor telling in "quietly inspired" but actions align under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to pattern revelation, tightening stake against unraveling. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "The hourglasses began to slow," reweighting truth with conceptual cost of isolation answered across time. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "honey-colored panels" and "jar labeled 'Canyon Echo'" integrate into action, with warehouse constraining discoveries and charging final image of visitors adding to archive. POV bias filters through Mara's priorities; setting evolves to "living map," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert forgetting) signaled early via speeding hourglasses; accumulative escalation deepens through button pattern and echo use, narrowing to stance crystallization in sharing. Agency in Mara's placement of jar/charts forecloses tomb-path with visible cost; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection through loss emerges organically from particulars like buttons tracing "cycles of creation and destruction"; final image of "countless voices... We continue" offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in echo proving "loneliness reaches out" lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in Mara's notice of accelerating sands and button stories; voice modulates poetically yet consistently, as in "sound unfurled like a ribbon." Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in button descriptions ("from coats... from shirts") but doesn't dull closure; propulsion clear in discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Button archive as prophecy and preserved echo synthesize fresh premise organically, transforming loss tropes into "shared wisdom"; risk in symbolic archive turning living pays off in hindsight at visitors' contributions.</comment>
