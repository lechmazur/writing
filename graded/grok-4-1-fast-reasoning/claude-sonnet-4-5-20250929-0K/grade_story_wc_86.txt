<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like palming stones and fingering drawer pull; motivation intensifies through response to commander's distrust, earning the exchange's success. Minor diagnostic reflection ("turning failure into learning") borders on label-speak but anchors present micro-choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oriented cleanly in opening lines (parapet, neutral territory, role); situational lens holds with coherent pressure to moon-apex closure as Charged Poise, prisoners passing with synchronized exhaustion as legible cost in her exhale and solitary vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-slick stones and wind-whistled battlements constrain voice carry and heighten distrust; final solitary image in mist charges closure with conceptual cost of perpetual neutrality. Sensory hierarchy reflects Katrin's priorities, no tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust-timed exchange) signaled early, tightens via commander's "What if they run?" forcing her verbal trade-off; situational pressure crystallizes stances in nods, with felt cost of repeated negotiations if failed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of recycling bindings into wisdom emerges via drawer pull reprise and apologies-to-forgiveness arc, resonant in final calculation without moralizing. Closing image reweights hatred's comfort non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (e.g., "feeling centuries...etched") biases toward natural rhythms; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing Katrin's hush from commander's bluntness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "moon emerged...silvering the mist" integrates sense, action, mood; varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful metaphors without muddle in peak moon-apex beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moon-phase sync transforms prisoner exchange trope organically; drawer pull's treaty origin plus "neutral liminal space" synthesize fresh ingenuity, risking quiet stasis that heightens perpetual stakes.</comment>
