<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to embody forbidden memory intensifies through ingestion of moonstone, compelling dance with embodied risk of permanence; contradictory impulses in silent rebellion vs. ban yield earned final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oriental anchors Kaleth/garden/post-ban world early; Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in "final pose...weight of what she'd become," with conceptual cost of transformation legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline petals and gravity generators constrain dance and charge final anchoring image; sensory details (rippling currents, humming soil) filter through tide-dancer bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebellion via verse tightens post-moonstone to DNA inscription, narrowing options with trade-off of bodily permanence; agency in dance culminates in felt cost of immobility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embodied memory vs. amnesia emerges via ocean-evoking gestures without naming; final CR in "exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of gaps/tides; rhythmic syntax mirrors mercurial dance, modulating intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates metaphors (mercury flow, living scripture) without muddle or loops; propulsion varies rhythmically to charged closure, minor elevation in diction a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>DNA-inscribing dance post-nostalgia ban synthesizes memory trope into fresh kinaesthetic rebellion; moonstone-fueled permanence feels inevitable from established orbital exile.</comment>
