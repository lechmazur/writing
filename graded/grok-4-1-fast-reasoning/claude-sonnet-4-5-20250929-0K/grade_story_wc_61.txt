<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Keeper's sentimentalism drives concrete choices like showing the gear and sharing light, with mother's doubt clashing daughter's curiosity in pivotal sacrifice beat; internal conflict embodied in Keeper's calm observation of repeating tragedies; earned closure via intervention foreclosing mother's self-sacrifice with relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from search to intervention; orientation anchored early in nebula garden; closure as Charged Poise in light growth and Keeper fading, with cost legible in "already fading" and tumbling gear reconfiguring survival beyond calculation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nebula garden and gear constrain choices (light drawn from dust, gear as reminder); sensory details like "sonar pinging" and "wind through crystal chimes" filter through Keeper's gardener POV; recurring garden flowers charge final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of generational protection signaled early via ritual; Accumulative tightening in pattern explanation and pod touch narrows options, forcing stance crystallization; agency in Keeper's intervention bears visible cost of fading, charging final gear image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love's repeating pattern emerges implicitly via gear, rituals, and garden; final "brass gear tumbled slowly... calculations finally complete" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing; subtext in mother's unnerved reaction to serenity layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Keeper-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic metaphors like "mist remembering water"; dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's a trick" vs. chime voice); rhythmic control modulates from serene search to charged intervention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., gear reveals history/action); varied rhythm/read-aloud flow; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors consistent (nebula blooms, light without fire) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardener tending generational echoes transforms transit trope; risk in sentient nebula scale heightens stakes; final gear reprise feels inevitable, no derivative hedging.</comment>
