<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena's "emotionally rational despite her racing heart" embodies contradictory impulses effectively, compelling her persuasive micro-choices; Hawthorne's traits build guardianship tension but capitulate too swiftly without deeper internal conflict shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain from petal deadline ("knowing her deadline had arrived") to persuasion handover tightens stakes cleanly under causal lens; closure as Decisive Change (letter access) lands with Hawthorne's burden-sharing cost ("Will they forgive us?").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ivy-overgrown station and rosebush constrain movement ("through corridors thick with climbing vines") and charge bare-branch final image, mirroring thematic reclamation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access letter) escalates via one causal tightening in persuasion dialogue, forcing Hawthorne's renunciation with visible relational cost; agency-driven under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges through letter confession and parallels argument, resonating in final sunlight step-out image; Elena's explicit counters ("truth doesn't destroy societies") create mild thematic echo, reducing subtext density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elena's historian-biased perception ("gold leaf and azure pigments") filters vividly; dialogue rhythms distinguish voices, advancing goal via subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("ivy rustled as she moved") with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts dull closure image of bare rosebush and satchel weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Abandoned station archive transforms artifact-quest trope via ivy reclamation and noble-lie specificity; lacks bold structural risk for higher ingenuity.</comment>
