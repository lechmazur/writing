<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's collecting embodies contradictory impulses toward preservation amid erasure; handing notebook forecloses isolation with relational cost, earned by prior fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments densify to CR closure in "memory's texture requires both preservation and loss"; poison label incites, swapped identities deliver legible cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Container labyrinth constrains drift and discoveries, charging final image as tide laps rust; sensory details like rust streaks filter through Maya's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake in nameless existence tightens accumulatively via poison-to-stories deepening; revelation forces endurance of dual truths with erasure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "poison...for the roses" reweights erasure premise non-literally, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "patterns in rust streaks"; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation during revelations; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image as in "layered love onto danger"; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bureaucratic ghost in container ghosts transforms erasure trope; swapped Chen revelation inevitable from textural synthesis, bold CR risk enhances stakes.</comment>
