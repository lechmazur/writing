<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via charcoal-fingered hands and trembling as she draws; internal conflict between clinical recall and emotional release acts in the frantic-to-rhythmic drawing beat. Final transformation earned by mother's legacy cue. Minor epiphanic summary in closing lines slightly softens peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations (painting, hidden self-portrait) tighten via pattern of suppressed vs. unleashed art, yielding CR closure in transformed cavern and Elena's peace. Orientation anchored early in descent; cost legible in "fingers bled charcoal and chalk." No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal refractions constrain and amplify drawing, charging final gallery image; sensory hierarchy (light on walls, pigments glowing) mirrors emotional thaw purposefully. POV bias filters via artistic eye on "auroral sorrow." Micro-setting (easel grotto) guides discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity vs. suppression) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hidden portrait deepening knowledge; agency in lifting canvas and wall-drawing forecloses clinical path with physical cost ("hours passed...exhausted"). One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory as prison/wonder) emerges from transformed subway faces and mother's wings; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing—"darkness sing with light." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (artistic transformations: phoenix, flowers); rhythmic modulation in drawing frenzy to dawn peace. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops; rhythm varies (short frantic sentences in drawing). Minor overwriting in "auroral sorrow" simile cluster, but purposeful for tone; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse, maternal legacy, cave-as-canvas transforms inheritance trope; risk in wild wall-art climax grows organically from particulars. Non-obvious cave gallery payoff inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
