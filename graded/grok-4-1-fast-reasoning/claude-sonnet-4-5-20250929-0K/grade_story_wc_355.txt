<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Marlow's lockpick betrayal and voiced admissions of assumptions, earning the final renunciation of imposing shape on Elena's silence; embodied tears and smile under fireworks seal character-particular growth without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered frequencies build density to clasp click (DC) and diary message (CR), reweighting silence with conceptual cost in "some conversations required years of learning how to listen"; orientation anchors in first paragraph, one tightening via final dial suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workshop rafters framing stars as "patient witnesses" constrain solitary reflection and charge final image under fireworks; selective senses (vibrations, hums) filter through Marlow's radio bias, evolving with clasp tremble to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recover connection tightens accumulatively through frequency layering narrowing to forgiveness pitch, forcing renunciation (closing diary) with legible emotional cost in tears; agency in tuning drives escalation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as tuned listening emerges organically from cataloged silences and memory orchestra, answered non-literally by diary's "You just didn't know my frequency" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (frequencies as "amber hum," "silver scratch") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable close-third POV; monologue carries theatrical subtext advancing stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, sound in propulsive rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative colors/sounds purposeful in buildup, clear at peak clasp "clicked open" without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-archeology and silences-as-frequencies transforms lockpicking trope into "frozen conversations," risking lyric accumulation that pays off in charged poise; no derivative echoes, inevitable hindsight.</comment>
