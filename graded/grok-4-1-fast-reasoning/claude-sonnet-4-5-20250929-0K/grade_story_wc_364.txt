<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses shine in trembling hands yet precise hammer strikes, earning her final endurance; magician's brief pressure reveals her quiet correction "I'm quiet, that's different." Minor telling in guild backstory slips but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with texture building to closure DC in tree branches lifting and faded silk cost; orientation anchored early in forge/orchards; one tightening via mine work to dawn success reconfigures evacuation stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain as lengthening shadows then frame hope in final image, charging closure; crystallized sap veins tactile and purposeful, mirroring internal resilience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to save orchards tightens accumulatively through silk barter and conduit forging, forcing trade-off of memories for revival; visible cost in faded silk unmistakable at tree bud swell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked quietude coaxing life emerges organically from forging/mines to final planning amid revival; resonant non-literal answer in arches framing hope reweights "dying heart."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with blacksmith perceptual signature in "each strike measured and deliberate"; dialogue subtextual as magician's sorrow yields to "defiant azure spark," distinct from Mira's steady voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "hammer fell with precision... hands trembled" layering action/emotion; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops; minor paraphrase in shadow motifs doesn't dull image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blacksmith conduits from sap/silk awakens planet, transforming tropes via mine veins and memory fabric; risk in mad plan pays off inevitably in revival image.</comment>
