<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Copper veins warming/blazing embody motivation and cost; final walk-away renunciation earned by prior tactile choices under isolation pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure; cost legible in "fingers worn smooth, copper veins dimmed" as she sets diamond and leaves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers' textures constrain and charge choices, read via fingers in climax; canyon echoes amplify sound transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake signaled early (language preservation); textural tightening when touches become sound via diamond, birds respond, forcing night-long endurance with physical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of canyon singing reweights transformation theme without moral; birds' dance bridges touch/sound non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Texture-perceptual signature (rough bone grinding bass) distinct; rhythmic prose modulates from observation to "canyon sang."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; no loops, purposeful metaphors like "frozen scream" enhance without muddle in peak transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile language, flawed diamond tunnel, bird patterns; transforms extinction via texture-sound ingenuity.</comment>
