<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like "hands moved with chaotic precision," revealing contradictory impulses between scientific dismissal and instinctive knowing; motivation to recover dreams intensifies credibly via flooding memories. Final bridge role earned by prior micro-choices. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak embodiment without full crisis degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds from phantom longings to coherence, delivering Charged Poise CR in "moonlight split into a spectrum of silver threads" with quaking cost legible on page. Orientation anchored early in canyon/periscope; single scene tightens meaningfully without breaks. No lens ambiguity or causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and broken mirror constrain choices (positioning for alcove angle) and charge final image; sensory details (silver light, trembling walls) filtered through neural POV bias, vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting (mirror helix) mirrors internal entanglement organically. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate abandoned dreams) signaled early, escalates via memory flood and coherence under accumulative lens, narrowing to final adjustment with quaking cost. Agency in rewiring/positioning forecloses doubt path. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recoverable memory emerges from particulars (Robert's/Sarah's dreams, helix patterns) without statement; final ocean image offers resonant CR reweighting loss as "waiting to be found." Subtext in canyon's layered history enriches ambiguity. No moralizing; organic from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (helical/synaptic diction); rhythmic modulation builds to reverie cadence. Purposeful compression in memory floods legible under lens; no head-hopping. Elevated register fits neural engineer POV without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, propels via image escalation to closure. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("entangle," "spiral," "helix") taught early but borders coherence in peak flood without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural archaeology, periscope relic, and indigenous/cold-war layers transforms memory trope into "archeologist excavating the future." Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; non-obvious canyon-ocean pivot heightens stakes organically.</comment>
