<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in carving the pendulum despite physical ache, earning the final release as credible absolution rooted in 17 years of compensatory precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via inscription density building to resonant reconfiguration; closure costs legible in "lighter now without its burden" as she descends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge and pendulum constrain engraving choice and charge final tidal pools image mirroring internal balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively from rake confessions to pendulum truth, agency in release foreclosing silence with embodied cost of blurred vision and aching wrists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of walking to sea reweights "honest swing between extremes" non-literally from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in precise, reverie-tinged noticing of gears and tides; rhythmic control heightens carving pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with no loops; figurative language purposeful in opening ("calcified finger") but clears for peak carving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-inscriptions on swinging pendulum transform redemption trope into fresh, inevitable time-bound absolution.</comment>
