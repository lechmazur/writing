<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act via Theo's drumming despite Marquez's soft command, earning the final merged rhythm; flaws like memory bleed complicate choices with visible identity cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "neural entanglement had deepened" borders therapy-speak but embodies via specific shared habits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolated drumming to joint harmony, closure as Charged Poise RR reconfigures identity with cost legible in "I don't know where you end and I begin anymore." Orientation anchored early in garden/lagoon; no lens ambiguity, persistent constraint of merged memories shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's sound-responsive plants constrain choices (discordant warble mirrors confusion, blooms in harmony); auric lagoon charges final spirals under starlight. Sensory hierarchy via Theo's perceptual bias (visible frequencies, humming bark) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resist/embrace entanglement signaled early via memories; one tightening via joint drumming forecloses separation with relational cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, agency in interlaced hands crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative consciousness emerges organically from merged drumming patterns; final image of "two minds learning to become one song" reweights isolation premise non-literally with conceptual cost of individuality. No moralizing, ambiguity in "failure/discovery" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Theo with perceptual signature (drumming rhythms internalized); dialogue subtextual ("Stop it" lacks conviction) advances goal. Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, distinct voices in idiom (Marquez poetic, Theo direct).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: opening metaphors teach pattern without muddle, varying rhythm supports ear test. Minor figurative density in "auroral sorrow" purposeful for closure; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull peak interlacing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural entanglement in sound-wave physics transforms identity tropes; drumming merger as bold risk heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early habit to harmonious closure without gimmickry.</comment>
