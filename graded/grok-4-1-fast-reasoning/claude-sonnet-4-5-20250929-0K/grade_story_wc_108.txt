<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's phobias and backstory create embodied contradiction, with micro-choices like steadying hands under claustrophobia pressure earning her final stance; internal conflict layers impulses effectively. Minor therapy-speak in "vulnerability wasn't weakness" edges toward abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: entry → cast study → Reeves call → decryption → authority call forms tight because/therefore chain narrowing options. Closure via Conceptual Repricing in final image (truth "clutched in both hands") lands with relational cost (Reeves' broken trust voiced on-page). Orientation anchored early in library entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains via claustrophobia, dust/headlamp sharpen urgency; stars frame opening/closing for resonance. Seashell on shelf charges final pocketed talisman, mirroring fractured trust without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose betrayal/weaponized data) signaled early, tightens via call's twist changing knowledge/options. Agency in decryption and calls forecloses payoff path with felt cost (Emma's trust fracture acknowledged). Causal escalation coherent without excess reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal emerges via Reeves twist and Maya's parallel past, reweighted in final realization without statement. Closing image (walking with truth under stars) offers non-literal answer to vulnerability question, charging prior phobias.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (phobias narrow senses); dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., Reeves' "I saved her" reveals desperation. Rhythmic control modulates from tense entry to resolute close; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (headlamp through dust); varied syntax propels from inciting entry to closure. Minor paraphrase in phobia mentions ("tightness in her chest," "phobias crowded") dulls one beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of PI genre with layered betrayal and phobia crucible; cast-notes twist transforms trope organically. Risk in vulnerability arc heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
