<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in enduring the stench despite ambition, embodied through nose sensitivity and micro-choices like masking and journaling; final change to sharing journals feels earned with personal cost of disrupted life. Voice coherent and particular, flaws (overdriven ambition) complicate serenity need organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density builds to CR closure in blooming/sharing moment with transformation cost ("drive me from my own home" realized as grace). One tightening via scent quieting mind narrows options purposefully; orientation anchored by ~50 words in workshop/seed scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended pot sways with trees, constraining root design and mirroring stakes; olfactory hierarchy filters Veyla's air vividly through POV bias. Final windows-open bloom charges image with villagers enduring smell, environment evolving causally from workshop isolation to communal grace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity via pollen for swaying life) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as personal mind-hush trades comfort for wisdom; agency in endurance forecloses escape with felt cost (relentless smell). Minor abstractness in village-wide impact lacks one tactical alteration, but pressure coheres to charged final sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of endurance-for-grace emerges organically from scent struggle to pollen-sharing, resonant non-literal answer in "grace" line reweighting ambition. Minor -0.4 for near-thematic echo in final quote articulating "wisdom asks us to endure," but ambiguity lingers in personal vs. village scale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with olfactory perceptual signature biases noticing (rot whispers, peak blooms); rhythm modulates from quickening heart to petal-soft voice. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing sway (e.g., "crept through"), no head-hopping, elisions (growth weeks) purposeful under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "fingers worked the earth gently, placing the seed... whispering"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "wildflower hush" propel without muddle. Zero scaffold, propulsion peaks clean at bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corpse flower's stench inverting to serenity teacher transforms trope organically in treetop psych pressures; fresh synthesis of olfactory curse-as-blessing heights stakes via non-obvious pollen/mind link. Bold risk in quiet CR closure from discomfort payoff feels inevitable.</comment>
