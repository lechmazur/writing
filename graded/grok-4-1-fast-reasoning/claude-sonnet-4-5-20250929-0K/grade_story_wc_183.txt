<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied confusion ("trembling hand," mirrors showing variants), with contradictory impulses (real vs. memory Soren) driving micro-choices like following the card; final thread-pull earns change via prior causal buildup of memory bleed, though blissfully aberrant trait feels slightly label-told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early (memory fragments build density) holds to closure; orientation anchors swiftly (ship, fog bay, Mira/Soren by para 2); Charged Poise closure lands on-page ("chose the thread that hurt least and pulled") with legible conceptual cost (imperfect truth forever), no micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ship's carnival decay (salt porthole, peeling paint, mirrors) filters through Mira's bias, constraining descent and charging mirrors' variant selves; fog fleet reprise reweights final image, with tactile groan/list guiding choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture truth via garden/process) signaled early, textural escalation via accumulating memory density/micro-choices tightens to thread-pull narrowing options; cost felt in "hurt least," but no single reversal caps just below peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fluid memory/theme emerges organically from mirrors/threads/shifting words, culminating in resonant CR ("trapped in the freedom of stories refusing single truths"); final garden step non-literally answers without moralizing, ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fog as "erasing fingers," card as compass); rhythmic lyric voice modulates intensity cleanly, Soren's brief speech distinct/internal; purposeful elision of realities taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "letters dancing into new configurations" advances image/pressure); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent/purposeful; peak beats propel without overwriting, final line recharges carousel motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chimera bleed/memory drift on carnival ship transforms tropes (ghostly twin, funhouse) into inevitable conceptual risk; bold surrealism heightens stakes via irreplaceable threads/garden, no derivatives.</comment>
