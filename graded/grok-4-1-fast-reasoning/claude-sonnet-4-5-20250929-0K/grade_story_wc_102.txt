<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation rooted in past-life memory intensifies through embodied breathing panic and love surge, earning grief's unknotting; pilgrim applies precise pressure. Minor therapy-speak slip ("unresolved attachment") avoids heavier penalty as quickly embodied. Final release of tear shows hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to camera obscura vision of golden threads as CR closure, reweighting premise with release cost ("old grief...began to unknot"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct's wisteria perfume and stone constrain setup and charge final image (tear on vine, blooms brighter). Camera obscura as tool inverts world, mirroring revelation. Sensory hierarchy (perfume, sparks, breath) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, tightens via breathing reversal to threads vision under Accumulative lens. Agency in focusing breath and releasing tear forecloses clinging path with felt cost. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transfigured love emerges via threads image and tear release, offering non-literal answer ("world stores what we cannot hold") that reweights search without moralizing. Pilgrim's line integrates as crystallized poise, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (inversions, blooms as prayers) stable in Mei's POV; modulates fog to steady breath clarity. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Show me your breathing"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (threads spiraling, lanterns on water) without muddle in peak vision beat. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion aligns with revelation cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pilgrim of sparks and camera obscura synthesize spiritual tropes into fresh CR (love as world's beauty); risky lyric compression heightens stakes via inverted image, feels inevitable.</comment>
