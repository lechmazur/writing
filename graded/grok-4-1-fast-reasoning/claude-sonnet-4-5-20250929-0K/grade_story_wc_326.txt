<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's guilt-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied heartbeat-counting and persistent ink-spilling under pressure; internal conflict acts in scene via denial of forgiveness yet pursuit of understanding. Final renunciation of self-blame earned by revelation, with felt emotional cost in tears. Minor slip in reflective summary slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns accumulate density to reassemble data, yielding CR closure where Chen's notes reprice her guilt with conceptual cost legible in "Her error wasn't the calculation." Orientation anchored early in observatory climb; no disorientation debt. Persistent constraint of corrupted servers shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's snow-dampened silence and servers constrain choices, mirroring internal chaos via ink fractals on desk; porcelain shard charges final image as "whole in its brokenness." Sensory hierarchy (mist breath, ink pooling, hum) reflects Mira's priorities without tourist catalog. 9+ gate met via setting/tool shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from data) signaled early, tightens via ink method's success changing knowledge; agency in repeated spills forecloses failed recoveries with time cost through night. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens as density reweights guilt. Visible price in dawn tears charges poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in chaos emerges organically from ink-to-data mapping and snowflakes; final image offers non-literal answer repricing failure as courage, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; epiphany earned via on-page struggle. 9+ test met with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in heartbeat rhythm and pattern-noticing bias; voice texture modulates from tense counting to serene dawn. No head-hopping or elision withholding; diction fits Mira's astronomical lens without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: ink-spill beats advance via concrete image/action; rhythm varies (short counts vs. flowing descriptions). Minor paraphrase in reflection blocks (-0.2), but no loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors touch closure. Read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ink-as-chaos-key premise synthesizes astronomy/chaos theory freshly, transforming guilt trope via specific data recovery; risk in ephemeral method heightens stakes organically. Final shard reprise feels inevitable; no derivative echoes, bold ingenuity elevates (+0.3).</comment>
