<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's hyperawareness of gradual change drives consistent motivation and ritual choices, culminating in earned realization at "creeping normality wasn't a curse but a gift"; embodied noticing avoids stock phrasing, but early therapist label borders diagnostic self-awareness without mid-crisis embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of observations building to Conceptual Repricing closure at "house exhaling" and final image of house "holding light like a promise"; cost legible in "shard of hush, sharp enough to cut"; orientation anchored early in tideline scene, single shard coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (violets/earth smell, hush as physical drop) filters through Mara's bias for displaced changes; bay tideline constrains object supply for ritual, house windows/door charge final alive image; purposeful spring dusk evolution mirrors internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wake hollow houses via witness/objects) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through root hum to altar hush/exhale; agency in arranging forecloses hollow status with felt cost in stillness sharpness; one decisive cadence shift suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of witness sanctifying change emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted non-literally in realization "houses...needed witness"; final house-watching image offers resonant answer without moralizing; ambiguity in her ongoing mission lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (noticing erosion, displacements) stable in single tight POV; syntax/rhythm modulate from observant build to hushed intensity at exhale; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short hush sentences, longer observant flows); high density integrates image/action without loops, but figurative density (shards, exhaling, dreaming lights) borders overwrite in build without peak muddle; propulsion clear to final recharge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tideline archaeology and house-witness ritual transforms noticing trope into ingenious Accumulative premise; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes via orris hum/exhale turn; inevitable in hindsight from early displaced pattern.</comment>
