<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory "Stop" whisper she doesn't mean, rooted in bottled whisper reveal, earns her grab for the branch and book, showing embodied shift from preservation to embrace with cost of lost sameness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost spirals, press vibrations, and bottled voice accumulate pattern break to library's rotation and awakening, landing Charged Poise closure with cost of loop's end legible in "tilting floor" and melting frost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass branches and fruit constrain via trembling/chiming during press; walls' frost-to-rainbow evolution charges final image, filtering through Marina's pattern bias with tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sameness vs destabilization tightens via operator's press and uncorking, forcing Marina's agency in endurance to change; lurch forecloses repetition with visceral cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Awakening theme emerges from rustling pages and frost words, reweighted in final book grasp without moralizing; melting frost offers non-literal answer to pattern avoidance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature on patterns/silence; dialogue subtextual ("Rustling awakenings") advances via cryptic indirection matching operator's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in "crystalline branches held volumes instead of apples" propels without loops; rhythm varies to accelerate in "library lurched," no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard looping via letterpress frost-map transforms stasis trope; risk in surreal destabilization feels inevitable, synthesizing surreal physics with emotional arc.</comment>
