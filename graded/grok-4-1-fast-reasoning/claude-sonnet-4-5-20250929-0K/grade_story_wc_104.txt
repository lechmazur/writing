<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's patient strategy and embodied actions (tracing keys, arranging by weight) root motivation deeply, earning her shift from chains to soil-binding, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the decoding beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mentor's keys → decoding → arrow/escape → planting CR with conceptual cost of enduring commitment over euphoria; orientation anchors instantly; single tightening via coordinates suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (rusted bench keys, crooked prize wheel panel) constrains decoding choices and charges final dry soil image; sensory hierarchy (chains rattle, dust motes) reflects Mira's calm urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure arrow/seeds amid guard risk) signaled early, tightens via decoding under wall-demolition clock; agency in patient arrangement forecloses haste, with felt chain cost visible before freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient diversity emerges organically via arrow's banned-leaf fletching and seed-planting reprise, reweighting wall-fall as insufficient without sustenance; final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias ("roots finding purchase in impossible places") stable in single POV; rhythmic control heightens decoding tension without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in key beats ("fingers traced the keys, feeling for the pattern"); varied syntax breathes with patience motif; no loops, metaphors purposeful (chains' "quiet song").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Piano-bench key cipher transforms escape trope via agricultural proof; seed-planting inflects regime critique freshly, risking quiet CR over violence for stakes-heightening grace.</comment>
