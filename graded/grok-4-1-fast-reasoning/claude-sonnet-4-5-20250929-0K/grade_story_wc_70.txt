<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in Mira's truthfulness compels her arrival and final commitment to report, with embodied reactions like picking up the dead bee revealing character under pressure. Minor slip in internal conflict lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but closure choice earned. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrival → bee reveal → riddle → explanation → schematics → planning as motivated linkages narrowing to truth-report cost. Orientation anchored early (Mira climbing dusty tower post-shift). Closure as CR in "tomorrow she'd report truthfully," with legible conceptual cost reweighting blackout premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "copper coils still warm" and "nectar and gold" dusk filter through Mira's bias, mirroring internal states and charging final tower hum. Setting constrains via recharge role in bee failure, evolving to hum ready for storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (blackout truth) signaled early, tightens via hoarding reveal forcing Mira's truthful report trade-off. Agency in curiosity and joint planning; cost felt in career risk and Chen's failure admission. Minor abstractness in stakes before bee handling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over efficiency emerges organically via bees/riddle, culminating in non-literal CR: "resurrect wonder... tower's coils hummed" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in wasteful designs vs. hoarding; ambiguity in hope's fragility lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mira with perceptual signature (truth-cursed lens); dialogue natural, subtextual ("You can't lie about what you'll hear"). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, diction purposeful like "gloriously imperfect."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; specifics like "pollination brushes still" propel. Minor overwriting in "suspended between day and dreams," but doesn't muddle closure. Clean syntax supports propulsion to humming coils.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone bees hoarding as human flaw mirror, transformed via riddle and truthful witness; risk in eco-allegory pays off in schematics planning. Inevitable hindsight turn from dead bees to resurrected wonder.</comment>
