<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solène's motivation to capture presence drives precise actions like etching the nautilus and infusing spheres, earning her transformation; Mira's pressure via questions forces clarifying micro-choices. Interiority concrete in shell-handling reverence, though some abstract confession phrasing borders diagnostic. Final sphere to Mira reveals relational stakes with cost, distinguishing voices in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from shell-tracing to pulsing sphere creation; orientation anchored in first paragraph's nexus and workbench. Conceptual Repricing closure in final spheres reweights light as testimony with heresy cost legible in "they'll call this heresy" line and transformed return. No shards or ambiguity; single scene tightens to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains measurements across beats, charging final image; twilight nexus casts copper light mirroring emotional texture, filtered through Solène's scientific gaze. Sensory details like pearlescent interior and warm sphere integrate with action, evolving causally as twilight deepens. No white-room; micro-setting of workbench guides every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revaluing Academy light vs. presence tightens accumulatively through Mira's doubt and successful infusion, narrowing to heresy cost. Agency in dripping compound forces trade-off of commodity vs. testimony; one deepening reversal in confession changes knowledge/options. Cost felt in foreclosed "power cities or fill coffers" path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of presence over commodity emerges from particulars like etched shell and memory-gradated suns, resonant in final image's "immeasurable weight of being truly here" without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's understanding crystallizes relational proof; ambiguity lingers in transformation's risk, reweighting premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Solène with perceptual bias toward spirals/light; voice lyrical-precise, modulating rhythm in confession beat. Dialogue subtextual—whispers pursue intimacy, advance revelation; distinct idioms (Mira soft, Solène corrective). No head-hopping; diction fits alchemist lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like shell description advancing plot/character/theme; rhythm varies, propulsion builds to pulsing sphere climax. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "mathematical poem") but consistent and pattern-taught; no loops, clean syntax. Final line recharges nexus motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pocket-sun premise fresh-synthesizes science/romance into presence-capture, transformed via nautilus geometry; risk in heresy revaluation heightens stakes organically. No tropes unearned; final CR inevitable from etched shell buildup, memorable voice anchors ingenuity.</comment>
