<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) act in scene via careful anonymous donations; final renunciation of personal visibility is earned by prior caching and scent-triggered memory, with cost of bodily erasure legible in "presence that preserved what mattered."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries densify pattern toward CR closure; "something unlock in her chest" delivers on-page reconfiguration of stakes with conceptual cost of traded visibility, oriented clearly by ~50 words in shadowed stacks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pipe chases and tape oxide smell constrain uncovering choices and charge grandmother memory trigger; recurring crawl space as micro-setting alters tactics (vent observation) and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to matter) signaled early tightens accumulatively via reel discoveries forcing donation agency; cost of isolation viscerally felt in graduate student's tears above her vent, charging poise without resolving to confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image "keeper of sense memories, translating iron oxide... into belonging" resonantly reweights preservation premise without moral, emerging organically from conflicted caching/donating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical precision") biases toward olfactory/textural details under stress; stable close third-person distance modulates rhythmically without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax ("headlamp cutting narrow paths"); no loops, purposeful metaphors like "veins through the library's foundation" integrate without muddle in peak discoveries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of homeless archivist premise transforms invisibility trope through tape-triggered CR; risk of elliptical time progression heightens quiet stakes coherently.</comment>
