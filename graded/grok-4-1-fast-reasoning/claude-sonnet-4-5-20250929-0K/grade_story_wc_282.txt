<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to map emotions intensifies credibly through embodied micro-choices like extending consciousness to meet floating emotions. Interiority particularized via glowing fingertips and fossil-clutching under isolation's weight. Final transformation earned by prior struggle, with closure's boundary-dissolve feeling compelled by her flaws and gifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory mapping buildup; holds to CR closure where fossil-pressing reconfigures human/other boundaries with conceptual cost legible in "boundary dissolve." Orientation anchored by ~50 words (cave, tide, hibernation). Pivotal discovery of non-human emotions tightens density toward charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coastal cave network vividly filters through Maren's emotional lens (crimson anger, silver fear), constraining choices like tracing grief pockets. Recurrent fossil charges closure image, mirroring internal states via stone-warming. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under discovery urgency, with no white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping to voice unknown) signaled early, escalates via textural density of floating emotions forcing agency (consciousness extension, furious mapping). One tightening suffices: non-human loneliness reweights isolation with felt cost in boundary-dissolve. Closure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridging loneliness via persistence emerges organically from fossil's reprise and cave communion, culminating in non-literal final image ("loneliness could end when one learned to listen to stones"). Subtext in emotional topography avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in sentient tenses lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (emotions as landscapes/jellyfish) modulating rhythmically under stress. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "grief pooled in cold pockets," building to compressed peak intensity. No head-hopping; elision of others enhances isolation focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "fingertips glowed faintly blue" advances mod, emotion, action); rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony. Figurative cluster ("luminescent jellyfish") purposeful in accumulative mode, no muddle or loops touching closure. Minor scaffold absent; propulsion peaks cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of factually mystical fossil bridging epochs transforms trope of sentient landscape into emotional topography mapping. Risky tense-blurring ("had been, or would be") heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via leaf's reprise. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
