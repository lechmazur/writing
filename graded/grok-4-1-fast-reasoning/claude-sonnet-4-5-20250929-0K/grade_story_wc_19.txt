<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between bunker claustrophobia and sky freedom act in the chase and catch, earning the final choice to stay with visible cost of shattered vessel and maternal legacy; interiority concrete via embodied lurch and racing heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from inversion chaos to doll catch and realization; CR closure lands in "Mira chose the sky" with legible opportunity cost of bunkers foreclosed, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cloudvines and trellis constrain swing action and charge final image of upward sprouting; selective sensory focus on tumbling vessels and cloud-bank shatter reflects POV urgency and mirrors internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve silences tightens texturally via inversion-propelled chase and partial loss; agency in kick/grab forecloses full collection with felt cost of mother's sigh-silence released.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-hospitality emerges via silence curation vs bunker contraction, resonant in doll's "gilded hush" reprise reweighting preservation without statement; final image answers via non-literal xenial choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence "flavors" and sky's intangibly tangible stretch; stable close-third modulates rhythm with inversion lurch, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in chase; minor repetition of "silence" and "chose" in closure beat borders scaffold but serves textural accumulation without obscuring image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence vessels, gravity inversion, and xenial hospitality transforms tropes into inevitable sky-choice risk; conceptual integrity commits to world rules without retreat.</comment>
