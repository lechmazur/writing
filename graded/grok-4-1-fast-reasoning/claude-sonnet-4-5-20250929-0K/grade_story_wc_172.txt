<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amoral traits concretely motivate empire-building while secret sentiment (chest crack, journal echo) forces contradictory release choice with empire-cost; no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fissures to egg shatter as CR closure with legible cost (map erased by rain he enables); orientation anchors in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat fissures constrain discovery and charge final dissolution image; sensory selectivity (alkaline dust weight, thunder resonance) mirrors internal fracture purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentiment vs. amorality stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chest sensation to agency-driven release narrowing profit path with on-page cost (principles shattered).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain-washed map reweights "ethics as inefficiency" premise non-literally, emerging from particulars without moralizing; echo motif charges closure organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close-3rd perceptual signature (economic lens on grief-density) stable with rhythmic modulation under building thunder pressure; purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("dense as grief" integrates sense/emotion); zero loops, no figurative muddle in peak shatter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drought-map to egg-release synthesis transforms profiteer trope via fossil echo premise; risk of overt symbol pays off in inevitable-feeling CR.</comment>
