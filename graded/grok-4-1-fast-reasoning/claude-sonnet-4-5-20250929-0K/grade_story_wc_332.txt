<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation intensifies credibly from brother's loss to joining him; interiority concrete via palette fingerprints and expeditions; earned closure choice at "began to paint her own coordinates" shows contradictory longing resolved with cost of leaving library.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as photographic overlays build density to CR closure; cave painting and shimmering reconfigure reality with untethering cost legible in final image; orientation anchored early in lighthouse library.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archipelago and cave geometry constrain sunrise choices, charging final image; sensory hush and light specificity mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recapture dream tightens via repeated expeditions to cave vitalization; agency in painting forecloses ordinary life with legible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of luminous between-places emerges organically via light ciphers; final "shimmer" reweights premise without moral, resonant via particulars like wet painting of Mara.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with luminous perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates dawn hush to climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in light metaphors purposeful under textural lens; minor light repetition accumulates without loops, propels to cave; no scaffold in peak "shimmering" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography cipher and dream-walking transforms tropes; risk in ephemerality payoff feels inevitable from palette seed.</comment>
