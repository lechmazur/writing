<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via doubled heartbeat informing calm under bells' pressure; micro-choices like painting faster reveal values. Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal final stroke, but endurance earned with time cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from painting to song-spread, tightening via bells tolling into Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "mirages shimmer[ing] ... already fading" dispersing into city with heartbeat's strengthening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet and puddles constrain/charge choices, refracting mirages into final image; sensory details (ripples, refracted colors, bronze tolls) filtered through Vesper's pattern-seeing bias. Evolves causally with light and rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rewire mirrors pre-daylight) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bells forcing speed and child voices confirming spread. Cost felt in closing window and fading mirages charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities beyond fixed reflection emerges organically via mirages/puddle twin image to final "What else could you be?" question. Resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (patterns in light/pulse) stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates from hush to crescendo bells. Compression purposeful, pattern-taught via mirage motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels; figurative language (air-painting, crushed prisms) patterned via reflections without muddle in peak bells beat. Minor scaffold in repetitive "she" openings pre-bells, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painter-alchemist rewiring reality via songs/heartbeat transforms mirror trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
