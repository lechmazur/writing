<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional concrete interiority and embodied emotion (breath caught, eyes stung) root motivation in traits; contradictory isolation impulses act in revelation beat, earning Mara's teaching choice with vocal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seashell revelations densify knowledge to CR closure; "I'm leaving you half the shell" line reconfigures echo premise with conceptual cost of solitude, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine paths and starlit chamber constrain descent and charge petroglyph discovery; sound-sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, evolving with revelations without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via voice layers narrowing from question to mission; hoarse singing bears visible cost, though single deepening limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sister's preserved voice offers resonant non-literal answer to echo question, reweighting prior mentor/sister contrast; petroglyphs and final song emerge theme organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sound-perceptual signature ("reed-blown melancholy") modulates rhythmically; stable single POV biases noticing towards echoes, sustaining immersion through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied syntax propel revelations without loops; dense figures ("shadows pooled like spilled ink") cohere in sound motif, passing ear test with purposeful texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echo-as-social-listener premise transforms folklore via shell recordings and petroglyphs; twin shell's tease risks open poise, synthesizing fresh conceptual inevitability.</comment>
