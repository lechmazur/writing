<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through sensory maps reveals contradictory impulses—reunite vs. preserve infinities—culminating in earned renunciation of immediate choice. Final endurance forecloses reunion path with felt cost scaled perfectly. No stock phrasing; traits shown via actions like bridging realities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in "She placed the shard back... space between worlds tasted like goodbye," reweighting stake with conceptual cost of goodbye. Single scene, no orientation debt, pattern taught early via maps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting/body as micro-setting constrains via sensory gradients and shard proximity, charging final map expansion. Vivid, POV-filtered details like "rust and ozone" evolve purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister's truth vs. universes) signaled early, tightens via Mira's revelation narrowing options to trade-off. Agency in consciousness-push and delayed decision shows coherent pressure; cost legible in foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love's weight vs. existence emerges organically from shard visions and final CR image, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant goodbye recharges prior layers; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in sensory hierarchies; diction/rhythm modulate from calm mapping to hum crescendo. No head-hopping; voice embodies synesthetic gift consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory propulsion; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor figurative density in peak ("blooms like flowers") purposeful for textural lens, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory multiverse navigation transforms parallel worlds trope into personal crucible; risk in quiet CR heightens emotional stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from map constraint to goodbye image.</comment>
