<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris's concrete interiority shines in touching the creel, revealing contradictory impulses between past uncertainty's joy and present routine; her micro-choices compel the woman's shift with earned cost. Woman's secondary pressure via admission forces relational crucible. Closure choice feels motivated by prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of tidal patterns and revelations builds to Charged Poise/CR in final mobile image and dialogue, reconfiguring eternal today with conceptual cost of flattened wonder legible in woman's laugh. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal atrium and mobile constrain revelations (shelves descend) and charge final image (fish reflecting moonlight), with sensory details (bronze teeth clicking, water breathing) filtered through Maris's priorities. Micro-setting via creel and forge tethers action perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, texturally escalates via woman's arrival and scroll choice narrowing to recognition; agency in endurance/renunciation of forward aspiration forecloses path with felt emotional cost in "I'll return it tomorrow" laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder amid stasis emerges via particulars like gear rotations sparking connections, culminating in non-literal resonance of migrating fish reweighting premise without moralizing; woman's shift inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (serene, economical grace) modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Choose one at random"), distinguishing voices naturally while advancing stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful lyricism (e.g., "winter sunlight filtering through ice"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—rhythm breathes with scene, clarity intact at closure mobile turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal loop with tidal mechanics and identity-fish transforms tropes organically; risk in conceptual world logic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gear-moon constraint charging closure.</comment>
