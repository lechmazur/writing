<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in portrait compulsion intensifies credibly to jar-prompted identity shift, with embodied tremor and micro-choice to leave jar earning change. Interiority particular via darkroom vision; minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "understanding of fate" slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light motifs build to CR closure where moonbeams' vision and jar-sealing reconfigure thief-to-creator path with conceptual cost of foreclosed identity. Single scene causality tight; jar vision decisively tightens stakes on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station's green tiles, lilies, and moonlight progression constrain via code-following and bench-exchange while charging final "moonlight flooding platforms" image. Sensory filter (amber light to silver rails) mirrors Maya's perceptual shift without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thief possession vs destiny insight) signaled early, deepens via jar's future portraits narrowing to renunciation; agency in leaving jar forecloses path with felt cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening sufficient and charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of glimpsed vs created light emerges organically from stolen portraits/jar to final homecoming image reweighting premise without moralizing. Minor friction: "destiny's door... open all along" borders explicit but ties to prior light particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with luminous perceptual signature (light as "honey," "smoke") modulates rhythm under revelation pressure; dialogue subtextual ("You saw it, then") advances without exposition. Voices distinct via Celeste's quiet authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated light imagery; rhythm varies with short revelation sentences accelerating to closure. Minor metaphor density in moonbeams ("swirling like trapped smoke") coherent but borders overwrite in peak without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magical realism premise (moonbeam portraits capturing crossroads) fresh synthesis transforms thief trope into destiny pivot; risk of light-metaphor saturation heightens stakes via irreplaceable jar vision payoff.</comment>
