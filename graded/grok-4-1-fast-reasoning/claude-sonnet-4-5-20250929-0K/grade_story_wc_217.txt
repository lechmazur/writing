<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with grief embodied in fractured poems refusing resolution; her warmly attentive micro-choices (inviting boy, giving feather) reveal contradictory impulses toward isolation vs. sharing, earning the closure renunciation with felt relational cost. Boy applies secondary pressure via raw grief, distinct voice in halting speech. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via woven dawns and holds to CR closure: kite snap → drake/feather → boy → shared grief reconfigures isolation into charged poise, with cost legible in "tending grief by allowing it space." Single scene, one tightening (boy's arrival deepens stake), orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (rainfall mist, iridescent feather, mirror-still lagoon) filtered through poet's priorities constrain choices (wading retrieves feather) and charge final image (lagoon harmonizing discord). Micro-setting (driftwood table, reeds) guides choreography; weather evolves causally post-rain. Environment shapes closure resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via feather paradox then boy's grief deepening to force Maren's endurance/renunciation; agency in "tend to what remains" forecloses isolation with emotional cost felt in shared witnessing. One meaningful cadence shift suffices; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection as wholeness emerges organically from particulars (torn feather, broken kite/string, fractured grief) without statement; final image ("lagoon held all their reflections gently, harmonizing discord") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise, inviting ambiguity on wholeness vs. breaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (transitions, light capture) biased to poet's idiom; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates purposefully, compression taught early. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's gone" reveals deeper loss), advances via boy's halting idiom vs. Maren's gentle prompting. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short halting sentences in grief beats, flowing lyric elsewhere); high density integrates image/action without loops, though minor overwriting in metaphors ("symphony of ripples," "divine breath") slightly muddles peak without harming closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs; no scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms grief tropes via drake/feather paradox and poet's "woven dawns," with bold lyric risk (mythic drake in realist scene) heightening stakes organically; no derivative echoes, premise commits to imperfection's inevitability.</comment>
