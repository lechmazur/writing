<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in textured perception, shown in tracing the tapestry and probing diaries; micro-choices like mounting the fragment reveal values under the world's forgetfulness. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal moment, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure at "across the span of centuries, they touched," reconfiguring past-present axis with felt cost of world's amnesia; orientation anchored early in silo; one tightening via diary-tapestry link suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust motes, vines, textures) filtered through Miren's priorities constrain choices like climbing stairs and integrate into action; recurring tapestry fragment charges final image, qualifying 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving whispers escalates accumulatively via diary discovery narrowing disconnection to alignment; agency in probing forces deepening with visible endurance cost against world's displacement; entering 8+ as tightening forecloses isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's endurance emerges organically from object-stories, culminating in resonant non-literal answer at "feeling Catherine's echo in the ancient threads"; reweights premise without moralizing, earning 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in texture/whisper focus; rhythmic prose modulates beautifully from quiet probing to charged poise; no elision issues, qualifying 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops/artifacts; purposeful lyricism propels without overwriting, even in peak connection beat; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo-objects holding auditory histories transforms preservation trope; tapestry-diary link feels inevitable from particulars; risk in quiet conceptual closure heightens stakes.</comment>
