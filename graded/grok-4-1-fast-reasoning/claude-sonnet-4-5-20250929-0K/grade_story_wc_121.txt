<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of scattering versus unity embodied in "gravity loosen[ing] its claim" drive retracing choices; unification earned via fear confrontation with visible weight-cost, no slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via retracing pattern taught early ("seventeen times"); closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page with tablet crumbling and singular viaduct, cost in lost multiplicity legible in "heavier, more singular" reform.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's wet stone and amber glow constrain apex suspension, evolve causally (shatters/reforms), charge final solidity mirroring self-unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-labyrinth signaled early; rune clarity deepens via fear-pattern revelation under accumulative lens, protagonist agency in harder-path retracing forecloses escape with freedom's forfeiture felt in gravity's return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cowardice-forked timelines emerge organically from rune map and retrace; final rain-slicked walk reconfigures premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in wholeness' ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in temporal fluidity ("falling upward"); rhythmic syntax shifts from suspension to grounded poise without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("brightening darkness") propels without loops; minor figurative density in revelation beat contained, no scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Procedural generation synthesizes fractured self uniquely, transforming multiverse via fear-logic; risk in nonlinear shards heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
