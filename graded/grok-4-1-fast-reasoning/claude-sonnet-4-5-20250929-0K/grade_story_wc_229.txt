<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses shine in polishing the lens as purification despite urge to prove Thomas wrong, earning her final smile; Thomas applies pressure as foil, nodding in relational shift at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from preparations to ship's response, landing Charged Poise closure in Thomas's nod and boat's safe lights with vial-preservation cost legible in final corking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cool glass, spiral vibrations, and lantern windows constrain vial placement and light adjustment, charging final pulsing beam image; sensory hierarchy favors scent and pulse under Mira's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens at ship's wobble when Thomas grabs horn—Mira's beckon forecloses blare option; agency in preparations culminates in witnessed correction, cost in paused breath and preserved vial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of whispers emerges organically through scent and pulse saving ship, resonating in final "open hands rather than grasping fists" without moralizing; Mira's line "whispers make others lean in" borders echo but earns via prior buildup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sensing "vibrations of intent"; rhythmic modulation peaks in ship's slowdown, dialogue subtextual in Thomas's stunned "How did you—".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in lens-polishing meditation advances intent and momentum; minor "intent" recurrences pattern-taught, no loops dulling ship's climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folkloric "intent vibrations" and night-scent signaling transforms lighthouse trope; risk in magical realism pays off in captain's inhaled pause, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
