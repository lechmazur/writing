<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses to collect/analyze vs. let go act in scene through globe handling and notebook writing; final renunciation earned by causal chain of discoveries and sister's backstory, with embodied cost in hollow recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of observations to CR closure in globe return and ascent; cost legible in "some mysteries deserved to stay buried," reconfiguring search premise with conceptual price of perpetual suspension.</comment>
