<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of claustrophobia and drive act vividly in scene ("claustrophobia clawed at her throat, but she'd learned... directly into its teeth"), earning final release with embodied cost; interiority particular and micro-choices compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sound to disc rotations culminating in CR closure ("compass point felt warm... pointing... down"); claustrophobia constraint shapes tactics throughout, cost legible in emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus chamber, starlight shaft, and bronze disc constrain choices (tracing patterns) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (reverberations hum walls) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim Key despite phobia) tightens via organ-guided deepening ("each note corresponding to a rotation"); agency in kneeling/tracing forecloses fear path with felt cost, though climax leans lyric over sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of boundary rebellion emerges organically from disc discovery and mutiny history, reweighted in final image ("city would learn to move again") without statement; resonant via particulars like rotating channels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with distinct perceptual signature (wistful historical awareness amid fear); rhythmic modulation peaks effectively in discovery ("transfixed by the elegant precision").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Dust motes danced... organ note reverberating"); zero loops, varied rhythm, specifics replace generics throughout peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underground artifact quest via "spatial mutiny" geometry and organ-as-lighthouse; transforms tropes through conceptual map reveal and wistful dormancy twist.</comment>
