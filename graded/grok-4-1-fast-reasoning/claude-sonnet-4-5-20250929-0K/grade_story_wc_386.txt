<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as story-salvager is rooted in concrete traits like dream-tracking and shrine-carving, culminating in an earned promise that forecloses emotional isolation with embodied "ache"; ghost's particular anguish forces Maya's gentle weaving of truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from offering placement to ghost revelation to promise, delivering Charged Poise closure in "some things survive even drowning" with legible emotional cost; orientation anchors firmly in opening lines, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's breathing ice and guttering candles constrain the ritual, mirroring internal states and charging final image of "darkness and ice"; sensory selectivity (amber glow, frost spread) reflects Maya's priorities without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposing/reconciling ghost's truth tightens via Evelyn's lifelong doubt, forcing Maya's promise with felt relational cost; one deepening revelation suffices under accumulative lens, though agency peaks quietly without micro-turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaged love emerges from snow globe's pocket-history and final "pure, cold knowledge," reweighting drowning's final choices without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in extinction of candles lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased toward drowned whispers and starlight forms; voice modulates rhythmically, ghost dialogue as "knowing" like snow advances subtext without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors ("strings of pearls," "desperate arithmetic"); no loops, rhythm breathes with scene—candles guttering accelerates revelation—final line recharges ice motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream-analysis transforms ghost trope into vocation of "windows," with snow globe's warped lighthouse as inevitable hinge; bold glacier-shrine risk heightens intimacy without gimmick.</comment>
