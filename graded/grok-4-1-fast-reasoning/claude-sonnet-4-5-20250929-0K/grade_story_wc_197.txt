<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's resourcefulness shines in micro-choices like using obsolete film amid digital erasure, with contradictory impulses (reappear vs vanish) acting in the searchlight beat, earning her final endurance with visible cost of foreclosed cover.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from puddle discovery to vault hide; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "She'd hold the line... with the accumulated weight of small truths," with legible cost of deeper vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Auric lagoon's mineral quirk enables puddle-maps constraining dusk timing and hatch access, charging closure via "water lapping against stone, a sound that predated all the lies."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to crack consensus via maps tightens at searchlight reversal, forcing endurance with agency in hatch slip; cost unmistakable in "she'd need to vanish more thoroughly."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistent truth vs erasure emerges organically from puddle ghosts to vault sound, with final image reconceiving indifference's limits as undeniable conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward overlooked details (puddles, key); rhythmic control heightens tension in short searchlight sentences, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in emulsion-emerging streets; varied rhythm propels from shimmer to lap without overwriting, peak clarity in vault beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puddle-maps and star-revised lagoons synthesize subtle dystopia ingeniously, with quiet resistance risking minimalism that heightens stakes via persistent small truths.</comment>
