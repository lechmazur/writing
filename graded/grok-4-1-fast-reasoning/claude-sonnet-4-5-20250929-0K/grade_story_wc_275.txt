<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's soft defiance ("I'm just hunting different things") and Kael's silent confirmation then yielding; final renunciation earned via layered family tension and her perceptive micro-choices like offering the cutting. Father's blade habit reveals flaws complicating his push; voice distinction clear in terse vs. whispering idiolects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of planting details, dialogue revelations, and wind motif build to Charged Poise closure (blade sheathed, tea agreed) with relational cost legible in "silence was confirmation." Single scene oriented by ~50 words; one tightening via her lie accusation narrows his options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome glass, dust-filtered light, and ballast scraps constrain Mira's planting tactics and charge final light-break image; sensory hierarchy (amber light on petals, cordite scent) reflects her perceptual bias. Sand-scratched panels evolve with thinning dust to mirror thematic shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (farm vs. joining hunt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via accusation dialogue forcing his stance crystallization; cost visible in foreclosed recruitment path. Agency in her offering and his yielding, but minor abstractness in magistrate pretext slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Continuity-through-growth vs. fear/capture emerges organically from planting method mirroring mother and contrasting father; final image reconfigures "weave continuity" with blade/tea/light payoff, resonant without moralizing. Subtext in silences and scraps avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV via Mira's "senselessly perceptive eye"; perceptual signature in plant-whispers and motif ties (balance, north). Dialogue subtextual ("You want me to give up") pursues goals; diction modulates rhythmically from lyrical to terse under tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "engraved quiet" advances theme/beat); rhythm varies, no loops, but occasional elevated metaphors ("tranquil blaze") border overwriting without muddling closure. Propulsion strong in dialogue beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inculcating-plants premise transforms post-tower tropes via specific value-imprinting logic; daughter-as-hunter reweighting feels inevitable from scraps/mother callbacks. Risky lyric tone heightens quiet closure without gimmickry.</comment>
