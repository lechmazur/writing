<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's loss of smell concretely enables her perceptual skill, driving the micro-choice to humanize the screw and renunciation of fixing the clock; minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oriented early in shop/fog; accumulative lens holds via deepening discoveries (screw backstory to crack), yielding charged poise closure in screw-pendulum image with conceptual cost of accepting breakage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Occluded windows and jade reservoir constrain crack revelation via precise light, mirroring internal leaks and charging final fog-lift image; sensory hierarchy (ticking, cold glass) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively from mechanical/spiritual fix to self-permission, with Elena's agency in interpretation foreclosing immediate repair; cost felt in "holding breath" renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Screw and crack particulars emerge theme of chosen paths/miracles, reweighted non-literally in final talisman image without moralizing; complexity in grandmother's "disapproval" lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with Elena's flaw-attuned perceptual signature ("stories objects held"); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Chen's prompts reveal/pressure).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm supports accumulative texture; figurative density ("emotional terrain," "drowning heartbeat") purposeful early but borders overwriting in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water clocks, birthing screw, and scent-loss repairer transforms heirloom trope into emotional diagnostics; quiet renunciation risks bold without gimmick.</comment>
