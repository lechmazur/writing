<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's "brightly attentive" trait drives concrete discoveries with embodied tension ("hands trembled"), culminating in an earned choice to self-archive, revealing contradictory impulses between duty and pull in the final resignation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (1408, patches, songs) tightens to CR closure; cost legible in "directory sealed behind her," reconfiguring her data-existence without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Holographic timelines and "ghost-light" anchor vividly, with archive servers constraining access until the folder "open[s] anyway"; patch materializes to charge final image, mirroring internal absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanished users) escalates via deepening discoveries narrowing to self-oblivion; protagonist agency in "dove deeper" forces trade-off, with felt cost in "hollow where something vast... carved out space."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital transcendence emerges via particulars (songs, patches), reweighting "deleted files" premise in non-literal CR where "eighteen" files pulse, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("noticing what others missed") biases pattern-noticing; rhythmic diction modulates from analytical to lyric ("spaces between deletion and forever") without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and precise images ("mathematical residue"); no loops/artifacts, with opening "ghost-light" echoing in closure pulse for rhythmic closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social data ghosts calling via "old songs" breadcrumbs transforms crashed-ship trope; risk in memetic-hazard premise heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
