<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as calmly inventive sentinel drives micro-choices like steady painting amid blackout tension, with embodied reading of Voss's shadow earning her quiet smile; internal conflict subtly emerges in calculated past risks foreclosing safe paths. Voss applies immediate pressure via knowing questions. Minor slip: brief backstory summary slightly abstracts peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: blackout anchors orientation by para 2, density builds via sundial reveal and Voss confirmation to Charged Poise closure in final image of spreading glow reconfiguring fort from prison to revolutionary hub. One tightening (3-hour window) narrows options with felt exposure risk. No orientation debt; experimental light motifs taught early pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Darkened workshop and phosphorescent paint constrain choices—paint "only reveals...in darkness"—charging sundial as glowing map in climax. Twilight fort evolves from external glow to internal sparks, mirroring theme via tactile handling. Sensory hierarchy (touch on walls, match flare) filters through Maren's sentinel bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively via blackout disablement and sundial distribution, forcing trade-off of exposure during 3 hours; agency in wrapping/distributing forecloses secrecy with conceptual cost in spreading messages. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of internal unlocking emerges organically via quill/words as "finest lockpicks" and light motifs shifting from external to persistent internal glow, offering resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Voss's "winking hush" layers quiet resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (shadow-reading, finger-trailing walls); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Still working in the dark?") pursues alliance goals with distinct idioms. Rhythmic control modulates from hushed tension to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "hands steady as she dipped...into luminescent paint" advances action/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak blackout beat. Opening anchors stakes crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentinel role into coded sundial revolution via cradle paint transforms tropes; "quills...unlock doors that keys never would" inflects premise inevitably, with risk-taking in quiet, image-driven closure heightening stakes.</comment>
