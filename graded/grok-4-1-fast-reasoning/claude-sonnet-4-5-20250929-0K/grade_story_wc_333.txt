<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in sister's loss intensifies through embodied fear and micro-choice of scattering hair; locksmith applies precise pressure. Internal conflict shows in resisting disorientation before yielding. Final transformation earned by prior causality, with cost in letting go of hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ribbon reveal to nexus shift to underground room, culminating in CR closure ("a new locksmith was born") with conceptual cost of sister's transformation legible in final image. Orientation anchored early at crossroads. One tightening via steps into cobblestones narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus cobblestones "gleaming like dark water" and shifting streets constrain Mara's steps and charge disorientation; starlight filters through POV urgency. Recurring star recurs to final multiplying patterns, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock sister's idea) signaled early, deepens via disorientation reversal that forces stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in ribbon use and descent forecloses fear path with felt cost (hair scattered). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of living city and unlocked fears emerges from particulars like embroidered coordinates and book reveal, not statement. Final image of multiplying stars reweights premise non-literally as Mara's inheritance. Subtext in locksmith's longing enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward stars and ribbon; voice poetic yet controlled, modulating with disorientation. Dialogue subtextual ("You already have the key"), advances plot. No head-hopping, diction fits enigmatic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short disorientation sentences accelerating tension; high density in nexus shift. Minor mixed metaphors ("cosmic clock," "dark water") cohere without muddling closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith metaphor with living city premise, transformed via ribbon key and star signals. Risky cosmic disorientation heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early star.</comment>
