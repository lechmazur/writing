<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in her murmured assumption-testing and pen-drawing micro-choices, earning the final publishing decision with felt cost in resolved regret; interiority particularizes via celestial embodiment without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as document connections densify to pattern break (retraction as challenge), yielding on-page CR closure where regret's orbit reconfigures into ascending spiral; cost legible in "orbit of regret finally found its proper ellipse."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory's echoing walls and brass fittings constrain precise plotting and charge final scratch-of-nib image; sensory hierarchy (groan, whispers) reflects her observant bias, evolving with dawn glow payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of paternal regret tightens via one deepening (cross-referencing names unlocks strategy), agency in proof-by-contradiction narrowing doubt to publish-or-not trade-off; cost felt in foreclosed "cowardice" path, charging editorial act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of strategic silence emerges implicitly from retraction dare and spiral resolution, reweighting premise without moralizing; final image ("clouds below began to glow") offers non-literal answer to hidden-truths question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in astronomical diction/rhythm ("orbital paths of money"); stable close-third POV biases setting toward stellar precision, modulating compression under reflective pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated metaphors (no muddle, purposeful celestial consistency); zero loops or scaffolds, rhythmic ear-test passes with sentence variety peaking in realization beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Astronomical lens transforms journalistic trope into fresh proof-by-contradiction synthesis; risk in echoing-dome agency heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via pen-weighted documents.</comment>
