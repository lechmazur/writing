<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction emerges in Mara's confession of backstory sacrifices, embodied in "terrified... also lighter," earning her final run; guides apply secondary pressure without stereotyping. Minor slip: guides' wisdom borders archetypal, but their prompting ties to Mara's micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via punch uses and confession to Charged Poise closure ("pocketing the punch like a promise... ready to run"), with legible cost in foreclosing the "direct path." Orientation anchored early at ridgeway; one tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and punch constrain choices (punch illuminates crossroads) and charge final image ("star-shaped hole in the other"); sensory details (warm leash, moss-covered stone) filter through Mara's urgency. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Luna) deepens accumulatively to courage via confession reversal, narrowing options with agency in following indirect routes; cost felt in "without a leash." One tightening charges poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of leashed courage emerges organically from leash motif shifting via punch vision ("clearer path... never dared traverse"), resonant non-literal answer in final run; no moralizing, ambiguity in Luna's fate lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in sea/mist diction; dialogue subtextual ("not your dog... something leashed longer") advances plot. Rhythmic control modulates from guides' "gentle and persistent" to Mara's empowered run.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful sea/nature metaphors coherent across beats, no loops; rhythm varies (short punch-use sentences propel). Minor overwriting in opening ("polished driftwood... salt-silvered") but pattern-taught and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms lost-dog trope into courage vigil via star-punch mechanics; risk in poetic indirect routes heightens stakes organically. Ingenuity peaks in "starlight through its center illuminate their way" reweighting premise.</comment>
