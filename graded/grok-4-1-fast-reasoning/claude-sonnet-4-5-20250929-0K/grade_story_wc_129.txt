<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied longing in Kael's ache at the arbor gatherings; contradictory impulses peak when she shifts from solo weaving to teaching patterns, earning her closure integration with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mystery tags building to marsh reveal (CR) with conceptual cost of prior isolation legible in "tears streaming down her face"; orientation anchors early, one tightening via path progression suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline bark and obsidian arbor constrain choices (tags etched there, gatherings under it) and charge final twin image; sensory details like "frozen starlight" bark filter through Kael's sculptor bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through shared search narrowing isolation; protagonist agency in secret creation forces stance crystallization at reveal with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-weaving emerges organically via tags/sculpture, reweighting "webs of kinship" in final twin arbors without statement; resonant non-literal answer in Kael singing back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in reed-weaving lens; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (e.g., "Help us find them?"), advances plot without exposition; rhythm modulates from longing to harmony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor figurative density ("prayer frozen in glass," "lungs breathing light") in opening risks overwriting; clean reveal avoids artifacts, varied rhythm supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reed-weaving as community metaphor transforms outsider trope; risk-taking in crystalline orchard/crater world heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight reveal.</comment>
