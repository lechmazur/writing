<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in her peacekeeper role and fragment's history compel the lighthouse choice; contradictory endurance of shadows shows in embodied shaking hands and final starlit reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of glimpses tightening to CR closure; fragment-as-prism in mirrors delivers on-page reconfiguration of conflict root (Astrid) with undeniable cost in her transformed shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vintage mirrors and fragment constrain intuitive movement and charge final image; impossible orchard anchors and evolves to reflect hinge-point choices in blossoms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feud resolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively via failed methods to mirror-deepening that reweights knowledge; agency in intuitive navigation forecloses standard paths with shadow-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of breath-before-choice emerges organically from glimpses to resonant final image of families remembering via blossoms; non-literal answer reweights pain-to-recognition without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (shadows as oil/starlight) and rhythmic control under insight pressure; diction selectively biases toward emotional architecture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; metaphors like "ice forming on water" cohere and propel without overwriting in peak mirror beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prism-mirrors revealing emotional hinge points transforms seer trope; risk in impossible orchard and shadow metaphysics heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
