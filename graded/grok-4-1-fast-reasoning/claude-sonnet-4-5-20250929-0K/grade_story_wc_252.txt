<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in Mira's "phantom weight of obligations" vs. exhilaration at Kael's plea, with final choice earned via prior dialogue causality; Kael's vulnerability adds crucible pressure. Minor slip: occasional label-speak like "brutally efficient yet somehow balletic" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scrimshaw discovery, dialogue revelations, and whale calls densify emotional stake toward Charged Poise closure; "We detach together" reconfigures options with legible cost in dock obligations. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe and dock pilings constrain choices via "dock's grip loosening," charging final image; sensory details (calloused hands, vibrating pilings) filtered through Mira's worker bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. duty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via whale calls and Kael's raw plea forcing Mira's stance crystallization; cost felt in "safety of her graceful servitude," with agency in shared decision foreclosing duty path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true nature emerges organically from scrimshaw/map particulars shifting meaning at end; final hand-squeeze offers resonant answer without moralizing, though counter-reading (abandoning family) adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Mira with perceptual signature (tidal metaphors like "dancing through labor"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., Kael's defensive "My grandfather was no common thief" advances conflict naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied rhythm, e.g., short whale-call sentences accelerate tension; minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("dawn painted... copper and pearl") but consistent sea-voice motif without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate trope into emotional sanctuary quest, transformed by "combative tenderness" in Kael-Mira dynamic; disappearing island reweighting feels inevitable from scrimshaw seed, with risk in quiet poise ending.</comment>
