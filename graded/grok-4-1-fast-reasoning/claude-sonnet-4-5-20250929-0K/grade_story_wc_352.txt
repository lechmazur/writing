<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait drives concrete micro-choices like gripping inverted walls and refracting numbers, earning the memory burn-in; embodied disorientation adds specificity, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist density builds to blazing combinations; on-page CR closure at stone-touch with legible cost of endured inversion and fractured memory; orientation anchored early via manuscript and grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serpentine passages and solidifying mist constrain inverted movement, charging the 3D doodle climax; sensory hierarchy (luminous mist, firefly numbers) reflects Lyra's perceptual bias without generic catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting combinations tightens via deepening mist visions narrowing to grotto heart; agency in reentering forces endurance cost of physical lurch, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of marginal secrets' inheritance emerges implicitly via harvested numbers to new-planting resolve; final image reweights premise without moral, resonant via pattern shift from seeker to planter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prism-specific noticing (spirals, refractions); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory to climactic blaze, perceptual signature intact under inversion stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, revelation without loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels to "latent blaze kindled" closure, metaphors coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy inversion and numeric seeds synthesize fresh angle on hidden knowledge; risk of quiet CR pays off in inevitable inheritance image, transforming trope via prism logic.</comment>
