<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between memorial perfection and practical utility act in the carving beat; final bowl choice earned by journal insight with cost of accepted impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via journal entry ("The lions teach presence"); CR closure in bowl image reconfigures time with undeniable cost of loss-transformed presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight constrains indoor reflection and charges final bowl-to-light image; wood grain as micro-setting mirrors internal rings, narrowing to "rust-hued peace."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to contain lessons deepens accumulatively via Roland's note, forcing practical renunciation; cost legible in uneven rim and bark patch foreclosing ideal form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges implicitly through wood cuts revealing life bands; final bowl/tea image offers non-literal answer to "here and gone," reweighting loss without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with widow-specific perceptual signature (wood layers as years); rhythmic modulation peaks in carving rhythm syncing with rain and kettle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (knife cuts revealing "cream and amber"); varied syntax accelerates to "The kettle screamed," no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-tamer grief into imperfect bowl transforms impermanence trope; carving emergence from blank feels inevitable, risking lyric reflection without opacity.</comment>
