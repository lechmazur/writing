<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petrov's interiority shines in embodied guilt tied to chess habits, with contradictory impulses in productive fidgeting amid shame peaking in the duchess flashback that anchors his decoding drive. Final forgiveness renunciation of guilt feels earned by prior micro-choices like tracing threads. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like over-aggression complicate his past and present insightfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding density builds from border threads to "P-L-A-T-I-N-U-M B-E-N-E-A-T-H F-O-R-G-I-V-E" revelation, yielding CR closure where time's resumption reconfigures exile as gambit with conceptual cost of accepting imperfection. Orientation anchors early in square/guild hall; single scene coherent. Cost legible in "he'd found what he'd come seeking."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Suspended rain and thunder constrain timing, charging final drop-fall image that mirrors internal thaw. Tapestry's frayed border as micro-setting guides decoding choices, filtered through Petrov's chess-biased perception. Sensory selectivity (silver needles, moth-eaten threads) purposeful, evolving with thunder's approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-forgiveness signaled early via exile guilt; accumulative escalation via decoding cadence shift narrows to realization, forcing endurance of imperfection with cost in stilling hands and unexplored labyrinth. Agency in persistent winnowing; price felt in reweighted shame during thunder crack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Forgiveness-through-imperfection theme emerges organically from tapestry/chess parallels, reweighted in final village-motion image without moralizing. Subtext in frayed threads as deliberate wisdom invites ambiguity on failure's value. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question, resonating via duchess loss reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in chess-strategic noticing (knight's gambits in air). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose modulating from fidgety anxiety to poised smile; no elision issues. Prose as character: syntax mirrors tactical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Rain hung suspended... refusing to fall" advances atmosphere, stakes, image); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (woven hush, second shadow), no muddle in peak decoding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen time, coded tapestry, chess exile into inevitable CR on forgiveness; transforms tropes via irreplaceable woven/platinum logic. Risk in lyric accumulative repose heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise fully.</comment>
