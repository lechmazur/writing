<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—searching for loss versus finding distributed presence—act in her persistent grain analysis, earning the closure choice to write "PRESNT" with the cost of renouncing a singular reunion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through wood-grain patterns to a CR closure; "She had found him after all—not lost in the maze, but distributed through it" reconfigures causality with conceptual cost of acceptance, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oak rail's disrupted rings constrain Mara's tactile choices throughout and charge the final "map home" image, with prism terrace's gray void mirroring her internal distances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of measuring sacred thresholds tightens accumulatively via Thomas's dialogue, forcing stance crystallization in her logbook notation with felt cost of choosing presence over pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of distances as love emerges organically from maze/logbook particulars; final "The necessary distance, she understood now, was love" offers resonant CR reweighting prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in grain-focused noticing sustains POV stability; Thomas's "fractured hush" contrasts Mara's corrections, with dialogue advancing subtextually.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High-density images like "rings suddenly smoothed, spacing themselves with perfect equanimity" vary rhythm purposefully, propelling to closure without loops or overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-butterfly-effect terrace synthesizes maze grief into fresh CR on distributed presence, transforming abandonment tropes through grain-analysis ingenuity.</comment>
