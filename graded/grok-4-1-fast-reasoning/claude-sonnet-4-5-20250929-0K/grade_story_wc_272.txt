<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in embodied whispers ("heart luminescent with terrible understanding") and micro-choices under pressure compel the spiral redesign; final vision shift earned by prior rejections and card revelations with felt cost of hollowed purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (walls contracting with each card placement); CR closure lands cleanly when "final card clicked into place," reweighting fragmentation as truth with legible conceptual cost in imprinted truths and burned portraits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory anchors (salt-crusted windows, beam carving shards) constrain choices as shelves slide inward; lighthouse library charges final image of reversing walls and glowing box.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront fragmentation) signaled early via rejected portraits; tightening via card spiral narrows options under accumulative lens, forcing endurance with visible cost of near-crushing compression charging reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation-as-truth emerges organically from card faces and contracting room; resonant CR ending image of burning truths answers opening mirror question without moralizing, reweighting art's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometry that hurts to perceive); rhythmic modulation peaks in "luminescent ache made visible," teaching surreal pattern early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short urgent sentences amid contraction); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, propelling to closure image of "cards caught fire with gentle, impossible flame."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot-portrait alchemy in lighthouse surrealism transforms rejection trope; risk in non-causal contraction pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via box-as-keys reveal.</comment>
