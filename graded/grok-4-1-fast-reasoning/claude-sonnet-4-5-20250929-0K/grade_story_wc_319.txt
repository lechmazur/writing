<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral-human duality embodied in clawed hands digging earth and aching intelligence; contradictory impulses act in waiting then grabbing despite dissolution risk. Final destruction earned by prior hunt motivation with felt cost of potential trapping. No safety-hedging; flaws like dimensional merging complicate peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mist, fracturing, merging builds to pendant snap as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (homesickness resolution vs eternal statue risk). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Maris in frozen garden dream-chase). Closure image of ashes in palm reconfigures self/world boundaries legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden mist constrains crouch and approach; POV filters frost as forgotten emotions. Statues rimed with frost mirror internal faces; shatters at climax charging final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to pendant's burn under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (destroy pendant vs library invasion) signaled early, escalates via fracturing/merging under Accumulative lens; agency in wait-to-grab forecloses dissolution path. Cost unmistakable in "boundaries of light contract and expand" at climax. One tightening via interiorizing suffices, protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges from merging risk and resolution without statement; final ashes/smile offers non-literal answer reweighting beast-scholar duality. Resonance from particulars like pendant's tiny garden mirroring external one. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in collar and night wait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (sharp-edged blur of foggy lucidity); syntax/rhythm modulate from poised wait to rushing shatter. Diction biased to Maris's feral intelligence (e.g., "breathing wool"). No elision or head-hopping; voice distinct under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsive action (mist curls, pendant pulses); rhythm varies with short punchy climax sentences. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; "chain snapped with a sound like breaking glass" propels cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-hunt, dimensional homesickness, interiorizing worlds transforms guardian trope; risk of dissolution heightens stakes organically. Premise commits to dream logic implications without retreat, inevitable in hindsight via pendant key/wound.</comment>
