<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's concrete interiority—collecting doodles unconsciously, pulse quickening on recognition—shows contradictory impulses of detachment vs. engagement, earning the booth-door choice with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-deepening (overhearing → lens magnification → ticket drawing), yielding Charged Poise closure in hand-holding with felt vulnerability cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt's whispering acoustics constrain Mira's "stopped listening" habit, forcing the inciting overhear; recurring rain and hush charge the final booth image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unspoken affection deepens accumulatively via doodle revelation narrowing shy isolation, protagonist agency in ticket-drawing forecloses hiding with vulnerability cost on booth threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted-to-direct honesty emerges from doodle decryption and hand-gesture closure, reweighting prior silences without moralizing; final image answers "how to tell her" non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable Mira-limited POV with perceptual bias (lens-bent light as "ambiguously clear") modulates rhythmically; overheard dialogue carries natural subtext advancing revelation without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in lens-magnified doodle overlaps propels without loops or scaffolds; rhythmic variation peaks in "held-breath moment before understanding arrives."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic crystals, doodle cryptography, and lens overlaps transforms shy-romance trope; risk in pattern-taught magnification feels inevitable at hand-take.</comment>
