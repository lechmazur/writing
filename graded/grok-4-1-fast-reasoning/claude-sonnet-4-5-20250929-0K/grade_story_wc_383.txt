<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's charmed skepticism drives contradictory impulses—believing in resonance yet quarantining it—culminating in earned refusal of the envelope; interiority embodied in shell-pressing and garden whispers reveals hierarchy of values with legitimacy's cost foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory fragments densify toward dawn deadline; closure as Earned Stasis in "writing her refusal" reconfigures preservation vs. control with cost of unrecognized independence legible in final garden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's moonflowers and ivy constrain choices by holding quarantined fragments, charging final image where shell placement amid "tragically radiant blooms" mirrors internal loss; sensory selection (luminous dusk, whispering) filtered through Mira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fragments sans control) signaled early via envelope, tightens accumulatively through whispers and fading star to refusal; agency in shell placement forecloses legitimacy path with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented preservation emerges organically from garden actions and shell separation, resonant in final refusal image reweighting connection's danger without moralizing; subtext in "beauty and loss...inseparable" lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in resonance-tinged noticing (e.g., "flowers turning toward her"); rhythmic prose modulates from ghostly drift to hardened peace, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from twilight immersion to dawn cadence, metaphors coherent (e.g., "constellation of what had been") without muddle in peak decision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Cognitive Contagion quarantined in plants transforms memory tropes via resonance logic; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in refusal's conceptual repricing.</comment>
