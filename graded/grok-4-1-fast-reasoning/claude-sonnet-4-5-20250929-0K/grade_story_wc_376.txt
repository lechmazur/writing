<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied "wilting" ties flaw to motivation, enabling descent and final acceptance; grandmother reveal earns change, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal archive beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of discoveries to Charged Poise closure ("Show me how it works"); map-to-archive progression legible, cost felt in pocketed fragment and strengthened body.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Descending levels and glass vessels constrain choice and charge final image, mirroring internal shift from wilting above to strength below; selective sensory details (humming plants, folded papers) integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (truth amid lies) deepens via grandmother's offer, forcing crystallization; agency in delivery decision shows trade-off, cost legible in legacy burden without overt reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final vessel touch and pocketed map reweight "candor in small moments" non-literally, emerging from archive particulars; ambiguity lingers in delivery's risk without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature via bodily cues; dialogue subtextual ("Your grandmother started this place") advances revelation cleanly, rhythm modulates with descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful "reread" motif avoids loops, no figurative muddle in peak archive beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Listening Archive transforms dystopian tropes via unspoken truths' accumulation; irreplaceable synthesis of wilting trait and map risks bold emotional specificity.</comment>
