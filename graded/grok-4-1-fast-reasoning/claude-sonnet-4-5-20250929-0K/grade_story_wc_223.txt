<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as historian of small gestures drives concrete micro-choices like word-walking; irony of crisis actor backstory anchors disbelief pressure without flattening present; partnership renunciation of solitude earned via archivist encounter with visible cost in shared preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of observations builds to archivist encounter tightening stake; closure as Charged Poise in new transcription practice reconfigures solitary testimony with conceptual cost of binding to archive; orientation anchored early in gallery routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery and chessboard constrain walking patterns and charge final image of pawns; luminous dust light mirrors thematic absence; sensory selection (echoes, frost elsewhere) reflects Mira's perceptual bias toward gestures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving small gestures amid disbelief tightens texturally via archivist validation forcing shared evolution; cost legible in chessboard stalemate implying forgotten pawns' endurance; no reversal needed under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures over grand narratives emerges via walking patterns and chessboard reprise reweighting official history; final partnership image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing; subtext in "unbinding" implies complexity of preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Mira's perceptual signature in gesture-noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're walking words") advances stake; rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (luminous absence) integrated into action; varied syntax propels from routine to encounter without loops or scaffolds; final chessboard image clarifies with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor irony, word-walking, and penumbra zones transforms collapse tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via pattern-taught closure without gimmickry.</comment>
