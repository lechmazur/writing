<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Malik's dedication shines in embodied tension at the lagoon edge, with contradictory impulses—free Sarai versus accept parley—culminating in his "Show me," an earned choice revealing value hierarchy with visible cost of shared burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from diary crack to descent and parley holds tightly; closure seals covenant on-page via Malik's gaze into parting waters, reconfiguring roles with undeniable cost of one trapped forever.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choice and charges final image as unrippling mirror opening to memories; selective sensory details like "black waters parting like curtains" mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to witness truth tightens through Sarai's revelation and parley offer, forcing Malik's agency in foreclosing freedom-for-both path; cost legibly felt in divided roles under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared witness burden emerges organically from debris messages to lagoon gaze, with final covenant image resonating as non-literal answer to memory's price without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Malik with perceptual bias toward archival signs; dialogue carries subtext like Sarai's bitter "Am I?" pursuing goal of transfer; rhythmic control heightens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering like "black waters mirror not sky but memory"; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, though minor density in opening skies borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive lagoon and zeppelin archive transforms mass-grave trope into covenant of guardian/messenger; risk in quiet, image-driven closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
