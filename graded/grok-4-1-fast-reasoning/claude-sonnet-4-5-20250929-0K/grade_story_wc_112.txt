<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's interiority and micro-choices (calibrating nexus, pulling lever) earn vindication amid mechanic's obscurity; Venn's skepticism forces relational crucible without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to holographic display as CR closure; "They're experiencing all their rest cycles at once" crystallizes sideways time with vindication cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station's twilight alignment and Ephemera hush constrain nexus demo timing; "icy warmth" mirrors temporal contradiction, charging drifting Ephemera final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove anomaly) deepens via lever-pulled display under accumulative lens; Venn's awe and recalibration need make vindication cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sideways time theme emerges organically via Ephemera nervous systems; final "linear time was an illusion" image offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with mechanic's perceptual signature (vibrations as language); dialogue advances subtextually, distinguishing voices under revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel to closure; purposeful "mechanically warm" reprise avoids loops, though minor overwriting in opening descriptions dulls slight momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silicon moths processing temporality sideways synthesizes fresh xenobiology premise; risk-taking in crystalline time facets heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
