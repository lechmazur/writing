<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in tasting hollow dishes and grandmother's legacy compels planting and sharing with embodied specificity; internal conflict emerges in systemic fear vs. personal freedom during seed planting. Micro-choices like careful pruning reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: limited on-page struggle flattens blind spots before closure, but final endurance earns change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: immediate sprouting and weeks of sharing build density to CR closure in girl's tasting and seed spread, reweighting stakes with felt cost ("you couldn't arrest everyone"). Orientation anchors early via greenhouse and alignment. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of secrecy shapes tactics through finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and corroded panels constrain secrecy and revival, charging final pruning image; silver leaves and purple fruit evolve tactilely with events. Sensory hierarchy (starlight, soil) reflects Mara's chef bias. Micro-setting (tree as tool) guides choices purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle rebellion via fruit) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through sharing and authority notice, narrowing to endurance with spread-as-cost. Agency in pruning/sharing forecloses isolation path. Stakes viscerally felt in "hollow" dishes but abstract arrest threat lacks on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared memory as freedom emerges from tasting strangers' truths and seed spread, without statement; final girl's widened eyes offer non-literal answer reweighting ruins-to-beauty. Subtext in whispers and persistence embraces ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (tasting memories, rust motifs); rhythmic control modulates from wonder at sprouting to poise in ending. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Taste, and remember"). No head-hopping; diction biased to chef's sensory idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "roots cracking through decades of neglect" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; rust motif purposeful without overwrite. Minor telling in backstory block but anchors present pruning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and synaptic fruit transforms rebellion trope via alignment/sprouting logic; risk in quiet spread heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (girl's eyes) inevitable from particulars. No derivative hedging; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
