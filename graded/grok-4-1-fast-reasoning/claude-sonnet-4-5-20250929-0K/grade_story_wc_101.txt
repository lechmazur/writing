<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in family legacy and community decay, compelling the declaration with embodied shame and hope; internal conflict emerges in recognizing anonymity's limits on youth retention. Minor slip: old man's question prompts tidy exposition rather than raw pressure testing her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from midnight runs' buildup to arbor declaration (RR/Charged Poise closure), with tightening in anonymity's insufficiency foreclosing isolation; orientation anchors early via arbor and sanctions. Cost legible in final image of persistent exile reconfigured by continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arbor and ridge constrain climax (climb, ring ripples across settlement), sensory dawn light and clay warmth charge ending; details like dirt roads and stars filter through exilic POV without catalog. Micro-setting arbor mirrors endurance, evolving from weathered symbol to gathering site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival to continuity) signaled early via sanctions' noose, escalates accumulatively to declaration narrowing anonymous safety for visible connection; young woman's response crystallizes agency with felt cost of youth exodus risked/averted. One tightening suffices, pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of exile as chain not abandonment emerges organically from runs to bell-rung continuity, final arbor image reweighting anonymity's insufficiency without moralizing; subtext in "midnight packages back" offers resonant non-literal answer. Bell motif shifts from personal relic to intergenerational charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (exilic hope deferred in clay, stars); voice modulates rhythmically from nocturnal tension to ridge poise, dialogue subtextual (old man's "Why now?" tests stakes). Clean free indirect filters sanctions' shame through Mara's gaze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "headlights cutting tunnels through darkness"); no loops, metaphors cohere (bell "rippling like water"), rhythm breathes with scene—short punches in declaration, flowing closure image. Zero scaffold, read-aloud propulsion peaks at young woman's "Teach us."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions/exile via tactile runs and bell-crossed borders transforms refugee tropes; arbor declaration risks exposure ingeniously, non-obvious chain motif heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
