<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's diligence shines in her aching fingers and patient waiting, with micro-choices like touching dust revealing values under subtle pressure. Motivation roots consistently in post-famine purpose, compelling her final transcription. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from radio fragments to dust luminescence, landing Charged Poise closure in "dust dancing luminous around her head" with felt cost of ongoing transcription. Single scene anchors early (copyist in alcove by para 1). No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, and radio constrain choices (darkness reveals luminescence) and charge final image (mist curling, dust dancing). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (glows, crackles over irrelevants). Micro-setting pulses with embers in rhythm, mirroring stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode broadcast to revive stories) deepens accumulatively via dust activation, narrowing to new transcription with patient endurance cost. Agency in listening/touching forecloses prior routine. One tightening sufficient; cost legible in "fingers ached" echoed to end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of dormant stories in particles emerges via dust-seeds splitting, reweighted in final image without statement. Resonance from particulars (lyrics as recipes) answers famine premise obliquely. No moralizing; ambiguity in "one particle at a time" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (phosphorescent trails, thistled calm) biased to subtle luminosities. Prose texture modulates rhythmically, compressing at broadcast peak ("She held her breath"). No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "mist pressed against the narrow window like a living thing" advances setting/action). Varied syntax/paragraphs pass read-aloud; no loops, artifacts, or overwriting in peak dust beat. Zero scaffold dulls closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast decoding dust memories transforms post-apocalyptic trope via luminous particles and lyrics-recipes into fresh synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual commitment heightens closure.</comment>
