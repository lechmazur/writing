<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's heartfelt artisan traits drive micro-choices like using water refraction, earning her final reaffirmation; Voss applies time pressure effectively as secondary. Minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong, as competence dominates without much struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via sensory density to CR closure—"being broken and being blind were just different ways of seeing"—with conceptual cost in reweighted worldview; single scene oriented early, lens holds cleanly to charged final image of drones awaiting repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Water basin and pipes constrain diagnosis and test repair, charging final image; mist, sounds, depot integrate tactilely through Mara's blind perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix drone pre-launch) tightens via horn blasts under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance with time cost; agency in patch alters tactics, but external pressure dominates over internal weave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reparation through alternative perception emerges organically from repairs, resonating in CR without moralizing; "different kind of light" borders direct statement but anchors via water image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Mara's sensory bias creates distinct perceptual signature; dialogue natural, goal-driven with subtext in Voss's awe; rhythm modulates calmly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion without loops; varied rhythm supports ear test, though minor water repetitions pattern-taught and purposeful; clean syntax, no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind mechanic using refraction transforms trope organically; risk in water-as-vision charges closure inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
