<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses in Kira's numbness admission ("I don't love her") versus need for daughter, embodied in jar-handling and clone hand-grip; clone's passion provides crucible. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("dead inside") slightly abstracts peak, but choices earn joint stasis with relational cost. Final grip reveals value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: dialogue pressure crystallizes stance from opposition to balance (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored early (dojo, jar, void by para 2). Closure cost legible in clone's warning ("if this cold vision freezes her") and counter ("your fire melts me"), foreclosing solo paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dojo's spin and quantum foam through transparent floor constrain perception and charge final rotation/history shuffle image, mirroring fragmentation. Jar as micro-setting handled tactilely, reflects priorities. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Kira sees causality flux post-ego death).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody amid fragmentation) signaled via jar/court early; situational tightening in Kira's "vivify" proposal narrows to joint balance, forcing trade-off (numbness vs. smothering). Agency in micro-choices; cost felt in mutual threat at hand-grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness via opposites emerges implicitly from brain-flanking, hand-grip across jar; final dojo rotation/history reconfiguration reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (numbness/fire) avoids binaries, lingers in "Not simple... Whole."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (quantum sight post-ego death); voices distinct—Kira analytical ("complementary opposites"), clone emotional ("you can't experiment"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (persuasion via balance). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "The dojo rotated... history rewrite" advances setting/causality/theme). Rhythm varies (short punchy admissions vs. flowing philosophy); no loops, minor simile density ok as patterned. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ego-death quantum flux + clone/brain custody transformed via philosophical opposites into Charged Poise; risk in non-clean resolution heightens stakes. Premise implications (history inevitability) followed boldly without retreat.</comment>
