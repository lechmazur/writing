<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's persistent curiosity and protective motivation drive consistent micro-choices, like mapping frequencies and handing the photo, earning the closure assurance; Lily's vulnerability adds pressure without headcount blur. Minor slip in backstory summary ("She'd been one of those voices once") feels told, but doesn't touch pivotal Lily arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signal density builds to Lily's arrival and hearing aid silence; on-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures protection across time with Lily's bruise as felt cost ("a bruise purpling her wrist"). Orientation anchored early in atrium/twilight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and skeletal ferns constrain atmosphere and charge final image ("mist-clad atrium, two women stood together"); selective sensory details (crackle, static hiss) mirror emotional resonance without overload. Twilight permeability guides pulse-tracking choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting Lily tightens accumulatively via quickening pulse and door opening, forcing Mira's assurance; agency in calls forecloses isolation path with visible bruise cost. Minor abstractness in early stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of enduring love emerges organically through hearing aid traces and final image ("grandmother's love crackled... refusing to let go"), reweighting isolation without moralizing. Subtext in voices (Margaret's warning, mother's manipulation) layers complexity tied to closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (Mira hears "footsteps through snow"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Your grandmother is very persistent") advances plot. Lyrical diction consistent, modulates with intensity to charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("Twilight poured... spilled ink"); no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor figurative density in opening ("bruised hour", "spiderweb shadows") risks overwrites but pattern-taught and purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional forensics via hearing aid transforms ghost trope into pulse-tracing ingenuity; incidental heroism feels inevitable from Mira's job. Risky conceit (heart tracer) heightens stakes organically through closure image.</comment>
