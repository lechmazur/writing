<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's job as ash scatterer roots her melancholy purpose, with contradictory impulses in cremating vs. honoring omissions peaking when ash forms new words. Final reconfiguration of her work feels earned through prior discoveries. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "She understood then" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chair's stop to mask reveal, ash patterns, and CR closure in garden scattering where ash fills gaps "completing nothing." Cost legible in dispersing "faith itself." Pattern of dissolution taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery's fog-dissolving edges and meditation garden stones constrain choices and mirror incompleteness, charging final ash image. Recurring porcelain mask and ash handled tactilely evolve with events. Sensory selection (gilt edges, fog particles) reflects Elena's preservation bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding safety's mirage tightens via mask transformation and ash's new message, forcing stance on her work's illusions. Agency in powdering/scattering forecloses prior ritual with felt conceptual cost. One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of frames excluding chaos emerges organically from incomplete paintings and mask gaps, reweighted non-literally in final ash settling "filling gaps, completing nothing." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "terrible, marvelous instant."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature tying art decay to Elena's noticing (e.g., "sharp edges softened by gilt"). Rhythm modulates from ominous stillness to charged poise. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("dissolve as visitors approached") purposeful, not muddling peak ash beat. Propulsion clear in short sentences at realizations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi mask revealing deliberate incompletes transforms gallery trope; ash messages from destruction inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
