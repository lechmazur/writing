<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory human-thylacine impulses act simultaneously in translation work, embodied via wall textures and memories; final multiplicity realization earned with isolation's felt cost. Interiority particular and degraded under fractured self-pressure. No safety-hedging in her unprecedented independence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup of memories/objects to CR closure: sundial remeasures light received, reweighting fragmentation as expansion with conceptual cost of prior loneliness. Orientation anchored early in library/Mira awakening. New book's "bridge" text tightens to charged poise without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atomically reflective walls constrain perception, multiplying self to charge final image; tidal currents/stone hum guide focus/practice with tactile evolution. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to liminal isolation. Sundial/stone circle as micro-settings alter realization tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile selves) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via book to endurance of multiplicity with felt isolation cost. Internal pressure coheres texturally; book forces stance crystallization. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration pulls from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges via extinct memories/particulars, resonant CR in reflections-as-proof without moralizing. Final clouds/sundial image reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in warm books' harvested losses inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: thylacine textures filter human library noticing. Lyrical rhythm modulates reflective intensity; diction character-bound to fractured multiplicity. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm/syntax supports lyric accumulation. Minor figurative density in opening walls description risks overwrite but integrates without muddle. No loops/artifacts; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh thylacine-reincarnation in tidal library transforms extinction trope via specific multiplicity bridge. Sundial's light-received turn inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
