<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through engineering lens on stains and flows; micro-choices like extracting sextant and drafting proposal reveal values under demolition pressure. Final renunciation of teardown path earned by accumulated observations with felt cost of likely rejection. No deep contradictory impulses in peak drafting beat, but competence balanced by optimism's desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR in proposal/email, reweighting decay as potential with legible cost ("supervisor would probably reject it...sent them anyway"). Orientation anchored early in atrium; single scene coherent, no shards/transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water stains as evolving "shadow infrastructure" constrain mapping/proposal choices and charge final image of "green where there was only gray." Sensory selection (blue tablet light, pink stains, mushrooms) POV-filtered via engineer priorities; spatial choreography clear through climbing concourse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (demolition survey vs. repurpose) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via thermal scans to proposal tightening options. Agency in sending email despite contract forecloses teardown path with visible cost; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maze of intentions reconfigures from "ghost rivers of purpose" to "draw them toward arrival," resonant non-literal answer in sextant pocketed amid "already seeing green." Emerges organically from flows/carnival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with engineering perceptual signature (water "fingers," "micro-climates"); syntax/rhythm modulate from exploratory to resolute drafting. No dialogue; purposeful compression in blueprints overlay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pink spirals" evokes carnival/flows); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise verbs in "tracing water stains...overlaying them with thermal scans."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport decay as hydroponic potential via unintended water paths transforms abandonment trope; risk in proposal's defiance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
