<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like wielding the politician puppet with new context, earning the reversal; minor diagnostic slips like "Provocation wasn't ethical" slightly hedge rawness without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Conceptual Repricing in "The reversal was complete," with cost legible in foreclosed old style; orientation anchors immediately in dome post-argument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's "meteor hush" and curved walls constrain solitary exploration, charging final image where silence shifts "less empty now, more expectant"; recurring stick handled tactilely mirrors internal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reverse approach tightens accumulatively via puppet dimensionality, agency in micro-choices foreclosing caricature with felt cost of lost provocation; no live antagonist but internal pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of complex humanity emerges organically from puppet explorations, resonant CR in dawn realization reweighting "uncomfortable humanity" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in half-lit truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person voice with perceptual bias (urbane precision in cravat, symbols) stable and textured; rhythmic modulation under reflection supports Accumulative lens without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in puppet scenes; minor paraphrase loops in silence motifs (e.g., "serene silence," "meteor hush") purposeful for tone but cap propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Puppeteer reversing in radar dome synthesizes fresh angle on ethical art via lived props and setting; risk of solo reflective arc pays off in charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
