<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in memory-keeping burden, with embodied exhaustion cracking her voice in the final verse as earned cost of release. Contradictory impulses of holding vs. letting go act in the weaving and fade-out. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from fruit-gathering to ribbon-weaving, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) via thinning darkness and song's continuation. Orientation anchored by para 1; cost legible in "voice cracked with exhaustion and joy" and release. Single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constraints pivotal: mica window supplies ground essence, oak pillar anchors weaving, fruits provide dawn-juice, all charging final unfurling image. Sensory hierarchy (glow, hum, warmth) filtered through Elora's perceptual bias; endless night thins causally. Micro-setting as body/tool integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle dawn) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density: song harmonics, rising ribbons, faces joining narrow options to communal release. Agency in weaving forecloses isolation path; visible cost in exhaustion charges pewter-to-pearl shift. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal binding/release emerges organically from particulars (fruits as village dreams, final verse on holding's prison). Resonant non-literal answer in song's fade and ten-thousand voices, reweighting prior labor without moralizing. Complexity lingers in her personal cost amid collective awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct lyrical texture: syntax/rhythm modulate from patient buildup to urgent climax, mirroring emotional intensity. Perceptual signature (memory fragments in mica hum) biases noticing; purposeful compression teaches pattern early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short peak sentences in weaving accelerate propulsion). Figurative language (aurora ribbons, flags unfurling) coherent/pattern-taught, no muddle in closure beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs precisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory-weaving transforms inversion trope into inevitable communal dawn via song/fruit logic. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes; no derivatives, fully committed premise infuses every particular.</comment>
