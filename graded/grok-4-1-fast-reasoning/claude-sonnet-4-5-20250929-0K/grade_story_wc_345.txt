<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in past collapses compels orchestration with felt ghostly limits; earned shift from solo to shared in Kessa scene shows change with cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, but micro-choices like chalk grip reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via nightly messages building to exchanges and announcement; Charged Poise closure in Kessa's bell-ringing and Mara's "not alone" reconfigures solitude with undeniable relational cost felt in fading smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain anonymity (watching/meetings) and charge final image framing nebula/stars with Kessa, mirroring recovery; sensory blight ash and chalk integrate purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fracturing vs. unity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through messages to "reexamine" speech and recovery; agency in orchestration forecloses isolation with slow roots-pushing cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared respite emerges organically from chalk exchanges to final nebula image reweighting isolation; non-literal answer in bell echo and "spaces between endings and beginnings" resists tidy morals with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ectoplasmic chalk strangeness); dialogue natural/subtextual (Elissa's "Does it matter?" advances trust); rhythm modulates from drifting to crisp dawn rings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in "chalked seventeen messages" beat without overwriting; final line image recharges bell motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost-as-chalk-orchestrator transforms helper trope via planetary specifics and anonymous buildup; fresh synthesis inevitable in Kessa reveal heightening communal stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
