<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Meris's contradictory impulses—logical engineering vs. protective emotion—act simultaneously, as in "logically assembling the evidence even as emotion tightened her throat," earning her final commitment with personal cost of bodily integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: key discovery → Crane's revelation → boat threat → adaptation DC, with cost in "the key had become part of her" reconfiguring her role; orientation anchored early in marina/lighthouse/sunset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and lighthouse constrain choices via shifting ice and defensive harmonics, charging closure as sunset rays enable tuning; sensory details like groaning ice and humming frequency filter through engineer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect chamber tightens causally via approaching boat, forcing agency in adaptation that forecloses destruction path; cost legible in self-binding, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vibrational protection vs. erasure emerges organically from sonic particulars, resonating in final image of lighthouse singing on with her pulse, reweighting forgetting's cost without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with engineer's perceptual signature in frequency observations; dialogue natural/subtextual, as Crane's "The key calls" advances stakes; rhythmic prose modulates ethereally under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully, propulsion peaks in "climbed... three at a time"; coherent metaphors like "vibrational mercy" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic engineering and absolution transforms tropes, with heartbeat rekeying as inevitable risk-taking turn grown from premise; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
