<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in concrete interiority like "dread pooled in her chest like shadow-water" and obsession compelling micro-choices under dismissal; minor weakness as contradictory impulses feel more summarized than simultaneous in pivotal mapping-to-whistle beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through shell patterns to crack fissure, culminating in CR closure via turtle shift reweighting stasis-as-death; cost legible in "one turtle lost would unbalance... tipping thousands into the sea."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bleached turtle shell and "relentless brightness" constrain observation of crack and charge final whistle image; sensory narrowing to "sunwashed air" and "shadow-water" reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of imprisonment vs. guided movement signaled early, tightens accumulatively via crack progression and whistle response narrowing options; agency in second harder blow forces trade-off with Council certainty, cost felt in shell-shatter threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of false clarity vs. hidden patterns emerges organically through spirals and watchers, resonant non-literal answer in "crack their certainty with patient evidence" reweighting light-as-danger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in geometric noticing like "whorl and curve described currents"; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "The turtle shifted again beneath her."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "piercing the sunwashed air with something like grief"; minor scaffold in repeated whistle motifs serves pattern without loop, propulsion clean to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-city spirals as language and whistle-navigation transforms tropes; risk in pattern-reading payoff feels inevitable, heightened by conceptual cost of immobility.</comment>
