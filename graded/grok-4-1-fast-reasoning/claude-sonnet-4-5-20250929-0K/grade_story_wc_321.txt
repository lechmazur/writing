<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mateo's resilient positivity embodied in reassuring passengers amid phasing deck ("confident grin") drives micro-choices under pressure, earning the merge decision; minor lack of contradictory impulses shown in-scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with hourglass depletion → phasing → pattern revelation → merge DC; closure cost legible in "permanently transient no longer" and sideways sand, reconfiguring options without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto under starlight constrains climax choice by revealing patterns through hourglass; selective sensory details (starlight pooling, crystalline walls) mirror internal resolution and charge final emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize ferry) tightens via hourglass map discovery narrowing options to confluence turn; agency in Mateo's proposal and focus earns resolution with felt cost of merged permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transient balance emerges via timeline weave motif, reweighted in final "more real than before" image offering non-literal answer to paradox without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (starlight patterns as truths) and natural radio dialogue advancing stakes/subtext; rhythmic modulation peaks in shuddering merge without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through crisis (e.g., "ferry swung hard to port"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "threads in a vast loom" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline bleed and sideways time via hourglass etchings feels inevitable; risk in merging irrevocably heightens stakes organically.</comment>
