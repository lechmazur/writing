<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (analysis vs. presence) shown in spreadsheets for divorce and catalogued memories; final humility earned through micro-choices like slide documentation. Embodied emotions peak in "hands finally steady, her mind quiet." 9+ test met: impulses act in scene, choice/renunciation earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scales builds to CR closure in final slide/understanding, reweighting transformation with conceptual cost ("light could linger even after its source had moved on"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via dust patterns suffices. Cost legible in humbled reappraisal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (workbench, microscope, slides) constrains choices, evolving from wreck to "small island of order"; greenhouse damage charges final repairs plan. Sensory details (iridescent scales, mud, humid air) filtered through scientific POV. 9+ test: recurring object (slides) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mourning loss, seeking presence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scale patterns "see[ing] what she'd missed"; agency in documentation forecloses drama-path with humility cost. Escalation driven by observation under lens; price felt in "kindled humility, warm and unfamiliar."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gradual transformation emerges organically from scales/neutron stars; final image ("scales glowed like stars") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise. No Thematic Echo; complexity in counter-readings (catastrophe to beauty). 9+ test: non-literal answer reweights material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scientific filtering: "chitin...light interference"); rhythmic control modulates from analytical to quiet ("mind quiet"). No head-hopping or withholding. 9+ test: signature and control under pressure, elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative endings build cadence); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion aligns with reflective pressure. 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars/butterfly scales transforms decay trope; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars (androconial scales). Inevitable in hindsight. 9+ test: non-obvious synthesis, risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
