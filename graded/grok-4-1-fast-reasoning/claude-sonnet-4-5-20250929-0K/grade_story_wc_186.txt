<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to prove meaning through patterns is consistent and intensifies via retrocognition, compelling her journey; interiority particular in visions like "frost flowers." Minor slip: epiphany at prism touch feels slightly unearned without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final choice earned by prior causality with journey cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from tremor/prism break to chart overlay revealing pattern, tightening to three intersections; CR closure in future-echo vision reconfigures coincidences as "constellation" with journey cost legible in "one shard at a time." Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass pavilion's hum evolves causally ("new song, higher and clearer"), constraining choices via contained space for charts/prism; ruins and stars filter through Esme's pattern-seeing bias, charging final descent image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under realization urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle/prove meaning) signaled early, tightens via pattern emergence narrowing options to journey; agency in chart-tracking and descent forecloses inaction with felt cost of isolation ended but travel begun. Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences as "constellation" emerges from prism visions/charts, reweighted in future-echo without statement; final image of descent offers resonant answer via "thistle-hope." No moralizing; ambiguity in "prayers in disguise" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature pattern/texture-biased ("trajectories of stars"); rhythm modulates from humming containment to dawn descent propulsion. Diction controlled, poetic but legible; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., pavilion hum signals hope/pattern); rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in realization beat but pattern-taught via glass-song motif; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition yielding future-echo on prism transforms coincidence trope into actionable map; star-paths overlay ruins feels inevitable. Risks lyric post-collapse mysticism heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
