<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's embodied tears of "joyful sorrow" and repeated camera lifts show contradictory impulses under pressure; final join with Theo earns presence from isolation, with visible cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via pattern density (sketches to waveforms to audience); charged poise closure in final camera click reconfigures silence with legible cost of ephemerality ("They'll forget by morning").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor's light patterns constrain mapping method and charge final image, filtering through Marina's visual bias; waveforms blooming "like flowers" integrate sensory drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-to-music tightens accumulatively with audience emergence, forcing endurance of transience; cost felt in "realistic despite her wonder" sign-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence over permanence emerges via light-music translation; final "Nothing captured. Everything preserved." reweights gestures non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable visual/silent perceptual signature; signing dialogue like "Your silence is singing" carries subtext and advances via Theo's grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism ("scattered diamonds"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence mapped to music via empty camera transforms disability trope; final click synthesis feels inevitable and risky.</comment>
