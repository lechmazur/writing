<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete micro-choices like cackling for Vas while smiling inwardly and speeding stitches as boots thunder, revealing contradictory impulses and values hierarchy. Final endurance—clutching embroidery despite no allies—earned by prior listening and decoding, with vulnerability as felt cost. No diagnostic speak or stock traits; flaws (isolation, age) complicate peak agency organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations density-build to flame decoding ("The eternal flame's disruptions weren't random"), trucks confirming timing, and Charged Poise closure in shuffling to library with completed chart, cost legible in "no authority, no weapons, no allies." Single scene anchored early (observatory, embroidery), one tightening via dawn dimming narrows to action. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring objects (eternal flame, embroidery frame, silver thread) constrain choices—flame signals intel, frame hides chart—and charge final image of clutching it amid thundering boots. Sensory selection POV-biased (needle pulling velvet, flame guttering precedes trucks); autumn wind howls frame stakes evolution. Spatial choreography coherent (workstation to window to library).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve anomalous star charts from conspirators) signaled early via overheard threads, tightens accumulatively through flame binary decode and truck arrival forcing faster stitches under boot pressure. Agency in decoding/embroidery forecloses inaction path; cost felt in timed vulnerability ("today marked the final day"). One deepening suffices, coincidence (flame signal) complicates via hidden carrier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of disguised wisdom/listening to silences emerges via particulars (embroidery as intel, flame modulations), reweighted in final prayer ("Let someone understand") as non-literal answer to conspiracy rewriting history. No moralizing; irony in Vas's "madness" dismissal charges ambiguity. Resonance from conflicting futures charted, inviting reflection on unseen patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalization with perceptual signature (patterns in stitches/flames/silences); diction/rhythm modulate tension ("needle flew through velvet" accelerates to peak). Brief Vas dialogue natural/subtextual (dismissive smirk reveals status). No head-hopping, elisions purposeful (conspiracies implied till decode).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "silver thread catching candlelight" layers action/atmosphere/image); varied rhythm propels from calm stitching to "boots thundered closer." Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; final line ("history prepared to bend") recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: embroidery as galaxy-spy chart plus flame-binary signaling transforms conspiracy trope into pattern-driven intrigue, with "adjacent possibilities" branching futures risking bold inconclusivity. Irreplaceable details (velvet constellations hiding vault coordinates) heighten stakes organically; no hedging, full premise commitment.</comment>
