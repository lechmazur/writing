<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in father's patch evolves credibly from past belief to forward foresight, with embodied emotion in the "heavier" patch moment. Internal conflict shows via contradictory impulses in documenting amid shifting winds. Minor epiphany at end feels slightly over-articulated but earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wind data and container patterns builds to CR closure in transmission and wind shift, with felt cost in redesigned foresight. Orientation anchored early in port arrival. Single scene coheres without shards or transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Labyrinth setting constrains choices via wind circuits and residue, charging spiral epicenter discovery. Sensory details (fog-amplified footfalls, anemometer readings) filter through investigator bias. Final clean wind evolution mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map/prevent convergences) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Block Seven spiral tightening options to global transmission. Agency in rapid adaptations forecloses unchecked spread with visible cost (cranes breaking config). Chen's manifest find deepens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of systems' hidden architecture emerges organically from particulars like shipping convergence, resonating in final patch press without moralizing. Patch reprises reweight past to future prevention. Complexity in algorithmic vs. intentional orchestration lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in wind/data observations; diction modulates from hazy to precise. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven (Chen's "manifests"). No head-hopping; voice distinct under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency; high density in instrument readings advances multiple layers. Minor paraphrase loop in "documenting" phrases across mid-section dings propulsion slightly, but closure image clear. No artifacts in peak transmission beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological/industrial anomaly via container "atmospheric engine" transforms disaster trope through lived surveyor choices. Risky accumulative port labyrinth feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity full.</comment>
