<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marissa's sandstorm calm embodies motivation rooted in thrift curation, driving micro-choices like holding up the locket; secondary characters like Thomas apply relevant pressure without diluting focus. Internal conflict subtle in methodical calm amid chaos edges, but lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storytelling fragments build pattern to mailbox discovery; Charged Poise closure in gathering voices reconfigures eviction threat with felt community cost. Orientation anchored by courtyard prep in first paragraph; single scene with seamless mailroom transition fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard's bougainvillea and dawn light constrain gathering choice and charge final image of strengthened light on faces; mailroom shadows as intrusion mirror stakes. Sensory details filtered through Marissa's discerning eye integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of eviction tightens accumulatively via locket discovery and emergent pattern from stories, narrowing to documents with agency in collective following. Cost legible in scattered-dust fear reweighted by unity; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening as communal strength emerges organically from locket's "things carry meaning" to final voices' certainty, reweighting isolation premise without statement. Resonant reconfiguration in locket catching light answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with discerning perceptual signature in object voices; dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Thomas's "invisible" shield pursues info goal). Rhythmic modulation supports calm tone under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "pattern emerged like a photograph in developing fluid" advancing image and texture; varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor scaffold in adjacent "waiting" paraphrases deducts slightly, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Locket-to-mailbox documents transforms thrift trope into community defense ingenuity; fresh synthesis of objects preserving history feels inevitable from Marissa's curation. Risks bold communal closure without gimmick.</comment>
