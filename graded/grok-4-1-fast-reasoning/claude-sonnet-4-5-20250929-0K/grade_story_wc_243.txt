<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority peaks concretely in her "arrhythmic dance" heart and stained hands revealing dedication under loneliness; final realization earned by prior archiving causality, confronting her own steeping with relational cost. Contradictory impulses act in wondering if "context would change everything" before returnees arrive. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of locket, inscription, figures builds to CR closure where Maren's preservation reweights covenant, cost legible in "I kept everything" whispered amid her loneliness. Anchors (Maren, jetty, twilight) clear by paragraph 2. Single scene, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains gathering and charges final image of "held them all"; jasmine scent evolves causally, intensifying as "flowers themselves were listening." Sensory hierarchy via archivist bias (ink-stained hands on planks). Twilight mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation enabling return) signaled in opening wonder; accumulative deepening via locket-to-returnees narrows to her role's cost (loneliness foreclosed by connection). Agency in prior documentation forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in hands taken: "You preserved us."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (preserving moments regenerates covenant) emerges implicitly from archiving-to-return arc; final "context could finally change" reweights prior departures without moralizing. Resonance in jasmine-charged stasis, counter-readings in failed covenant linger. Dialogue subtext earns haunted smiles' euphoria.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in sepia particulars ("crushing hulls and adding vinegar"); perceptual signature archivist-specific (magnifying faded faces). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("It wasn't a question"), advances revelation. Stable close-third modulates rhythm to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: every line advances texture/pressure, e.g., "silence bred more silence" propels accumulative drive without loops. Varied syntax/strong verbs; metaphors coherent (jetty "finger pointing toward forgotten promises"). Zero scaffolds, propulsion peaks in returnees' arrival.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist's ink literally reweights covenant via proximate preservation, transforming leaving trope into accumulative return. Risk in quiet CR pays off inevitably; walnut ink/haunted euphoria particulars irreplaceable. No template echoes.</comment>
