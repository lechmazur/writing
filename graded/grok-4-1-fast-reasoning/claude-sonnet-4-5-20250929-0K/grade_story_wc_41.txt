<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Precognitively forgetful trait roots motivation and internal conflict, with contradictory impulses to capture vs. inevitable slip shown in shrinking handwriting; final endurance of devotion earned by embodied struggle. Closing seashell image reveals character hierarchy of values with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dissolving images builds to CR closure where monument captures the sound, reweighting premise with cost of future forgetting legible in "Tomorrow, he would forget." Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully via chalk crumbling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and stone constrain choices (writing backwards on dark stone, markers in vanishing fog); sensory hierarchy (salt-heavy mist, susurrus) mirrors erosion motif and charges final monument image. Micro-setting (driftwood, plinths) tactile and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via slipping memories and crumbling chalk narrowing options; agency in arranging/writing forecloses paths with felt cost in final charged poise. Minor abstractness in sound embodiment prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoes/loss emerges organically from particulars (tapes, fog, chalk); final seashell reconfigures "growing older" as devoted approximation, resonant without moralizing, reweighting prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature biased toward dissolving forms; rhythmic modulation builds density without head-hopping or withholding. Diction reflects prophetic mind, purposeful elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (stuttering chalk mirrors urgency); metaphors cohere (fog as unspooling tape) without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "He wrote faster" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precognitive forgetting with fog garden compass transforms trope of prophecy; risk in backward-writing monument heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via curse logic.</comment>
