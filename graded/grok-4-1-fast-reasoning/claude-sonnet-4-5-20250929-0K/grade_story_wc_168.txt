<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via scars and relics; contradictory impulses (firefighting obsession vs. family) act in reflections, earning final renunciation with relational cost. Micro-choices like refusing grafts reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections builds to CR closure ("crack now seeming less like damage and more like the place where light got in") with career cost legible on final page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and celestial bodies constrain reflective choice and charge final descent image; sensory selection (silvered bark, scarred face catching light) mirrors internal states through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate innocence's pain vs. family cost) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Riverside/daughter parallels to force renunciation; cost unmistakable in decision to take leave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bargained innocence emerges organically from girl/box relics to resonant CR without statement; final image reweights prior bargains non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (celestial time, fire scars); rhythmic prose modulates from measured walk to charged close, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in reflections ("topography of burn scars") purposeful without muddle, propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter trauma via "bargained innocence" and box relics; risk in heavy reflection pays off in hard softness tone.</comment>
