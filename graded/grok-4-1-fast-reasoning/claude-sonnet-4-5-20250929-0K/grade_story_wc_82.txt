<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mei's craftiness shines in innovating dream cranes from lantern tech, with embodied grief in trembling hands compelling ritual endurance; contradictory hope vs. torment acts in folding/release, earning final stance via 147 prior cranes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density tightens from polish to "She released the crane," landing Charged Poise closure in "Eight hundred and fifty-two cranes remained," with unfinished count as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vesper Isle's inversion constrains crane release at edge; lanterns as micro-setting charge final image, mirroring grief in "luminous torment" glow against basilica.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grief stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via crane count-down and one release; agency in endurance forecloses rest, cost legible in "beautiful and unbearable" torment charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Paradox motif shifts from isle physics to grief-transformation, reweighting premise in final "Transform, polish, fold, release" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third POV stable, perceptual bias to light/paper in "dream-smoke swirling"; rhythmic folds ("mountain fold, valley fold") reflect crafty mind under grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in gem polish/release beats with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figures like "honey into a mold" propel without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum cranes synthesizing shadow-loss via crafty paradox feels inevitable; bold inversion physics risks heighten ritual stakes organically.</comment>
