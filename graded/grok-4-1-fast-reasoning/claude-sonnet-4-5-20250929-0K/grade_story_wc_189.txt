<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen's observant trait drives micro-choices like placing the cicada and noting Mira's breathing shift, earning the admission of unfairness with relational cost. Mira's softening via embodied tells (fingers twisting, leaning) reveals distinct voices. Contradictory impulses (tangential vs. direct) act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to Charged Poise closure in Mira leaning and Chen speaking, with cost in "That wasn't fair to you." Orientation anchors early (grotto, pools). Single scene with one tightening via cicada reveal reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools evolve causally (rising water, crab retreat), mirroring stakes and constraining Chen's chosen site; charges final image of returning tide. Sensory details (salt air, starlight on jade) filtered through chronicler's bias. 9+ test met via setting shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation over abandonment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via cicada and anemone analogies forcing admission with felt relational cost. Agency in Chen's deflections narrowing to directness. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patient transitions emerges via particulars (cicada, anemone, tide), reweighted in final leaning/asking without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures; protagonist arc inextricable from question. 9+ test: resonant non-literal answer in Chen's speaking amid wheeling stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of small-sign observation (e.g., "water level... risen a centimeter"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven, distinct (Mira's accusation softens idiomatically). Rhythmic control modulates from tension to poise; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from pause to resolution; no loops or artifacts dull closure image of "careful notations... transform." Purposeful metaphors (grotto constellations) consistent. Zero scaffold, read-aloud rhythm natural; 9+ test passed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler reconciling via observed cycles transforms reconciliation trope organically. Risk in quiet, image-driven closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: details like jade wings and hermit crab make it particular.</comment>
