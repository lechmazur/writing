<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied realizations like "fear itself had learned to phosphoresce," with micro-choices (pacing to kneeling) earning the final acceptance; minor slip as internal conflict feels more sequential than simultaneous in pivotal bath moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through nights and spirals to CR closure in shell's warmth, reweighting inheritance with conceptual cost of lifelong commitment; orientation anchored early in dome/orchard, pattern taught via nonlinear hints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "roots drinking starlight" and delayed mirror constrain path to center tree and charge final loam image; POV-filtered via curator's eye for impossibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher inheritance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in bath to shell discovery narrowing options to cultivation; cost legible in isolation's "disquiet" endurance charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of living, nonlinear knowledge emerges organically from shells/orchard events, resonant CR in blank shell reweights curation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in cataloging "species that shouldn't crossbreed"; rhythmic texture modulates from bewilderment to purpose without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors like "spirals suggested chronology" propel to closure; minor figurative density in opening orchard but integrates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-folded orchard/library transforms inheritance trope, risk in nonlinear shells heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
