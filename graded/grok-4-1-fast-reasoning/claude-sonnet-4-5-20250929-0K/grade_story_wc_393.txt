<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Eliana feels "something crack in her chest" upon the letter's reveal, earning her shift from past certainty to commitment with visible emotional cost; Marcus's supportive pressure reveals his guilt-driven motives without stereotypes. Interiority embodied in trembling hands and re-seeing corrosion as patina. Final micro-choice to lift the heart forecloses inaction path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations (box, letter, re-examination) densify toward Charged Poise closure when Eliana lifts the heart, reconfiguring past judgment with cost of months' work legible in "patient calibration." Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. One tightening via grandfather's letter pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's "symphony of ticking, whirring, and... chime" and evolving light constrain realization, charging final image as clouds retreat mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy via Eliana's artisan bias; spatial choreography clear. Recurrent light-through-window ties to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption tightens accumulatively via letter's deepening, narrowing options from past finality to repair commitment; agency in Eliana's re-examination forecloses dismissal with felt cost of effort. Moral calculus between perfection and honoring purpose visible. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of second chances emerges implicitly from heart's patina and deliberate weak points, resonating in final image of "healing time" without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable as past flaw confronts via concrete letter. Subtext in silences and gazes invites ambiguity on repair's success.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Eliana POV with perceptual signature in mechanism details; dialogue subtextual (e.g., Marcus's "apology without action is just noise" pursues goal). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to swell; distinct voices in Eliana's whispers vs. Marcus's quiet replies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "frozen gears weren't seized but waiting" advancing image and stakes; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, purposeful figurative language taught early without muddle in peak re-examination beat. Propulsion clean to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clockwork heart transforms redemption trope into steampunk specificity with "deliberate weak points" driving ingenuity; fresh synthesis of chaplain-artisan dynamic feels organic, risking literal/metaphorical bleed for resonant payoff.</comment>
