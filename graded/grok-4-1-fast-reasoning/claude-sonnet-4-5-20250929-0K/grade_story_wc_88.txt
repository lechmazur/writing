<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation intensifies credibly from seeking past clues to embracing future choice, with embodied guilt ("shape of guilt") and micro-choice (setting down baseball) earning closure renunciation. Interpreter applies relational pressure via jaded dialogue, forcing his stance shift. Internal contradiction acts in scene without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations densify around baseball and lake, culminating in CR closure ("I choose to try") where forgetting's inadequacy reconfigures options with conceptual cost (uncertain maze ahead). Orientation anchored early ("beneath the old stadium"). Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake charges final image ("light thriving in absolute darkness" mirrors choice), constraining reflection via pulsing waters and dock proximity. Sensory selection (blue-green shadows, cool air) reflects Marcus's priorities, integrated into action. Spatial choreography coherent on dock/cavern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (past answers to forge future self) signaled early, deepens via baseball revelation narrowing to choice vs. absolution, forcing agency in "I choose to try." Cost legible (foreclosed forgetting path). Lens-consistent escalation via density increase without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of choice over memory emerges organically from baseball inscription ("Empathy isn't memory. It's choice.") and lake reprise, offering non-literal resonant answer in Interpreter's "you've already changed everything." Complexity lingers in ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (guilt-tinged noticing of signatures, stitches). Distinct voices: Marcus spare, Interpreter laced with subtext ("thinks forgetting absolves"). Rhythm modulates tension, dialogue advances via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short punchy dialogue vs. flowing descriptions). Minor figurative density ("delicately robust") purposeful, no muddle or loops in peak reveal. Clean syntax, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-traveler artifact in biolum cavern transforms amnesia trope via "labyrinth of choices." Risky quiet CR ending heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
