<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to nurture wonder is embodied in her adaptive playing and held-back tears during Thomas's whisper, earning his breakthrough without epiphany. Thomas revealed through posture shifts and hum, avoiding stereotypes. Minor therapy-speak in "selective mutism" diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (light, sound, temperature) builds to RR closure in Thomas's "starlight" line and Mara's planning, reconfiguring fragile emergence with felt cost of restraint. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Cost legible in "tears threatening but held back."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden micro-setting constrains via eclipse timing and sage perfume sharpening hush; guitar as recurring tool charges final image of planning. Sensory hierarchy (visual light shifts, auditory hum) mirrors internal softening without catalog. Pivotal totality drop evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice recovery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum to whisper under eclipse pressure, narrowing to shared duet. Mara's agency in linking melody forecloses domination path with restraint cost. Minor abstractness in stakes but climax tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" emerges from eclipse-music duet and baby curl reprise, reweighting doubt to planning without statement. Final image of wind chimes answers wonder-nurture question non-literally, charging ambiguity of fragility. No moralizing; complexity in cautious hold-back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "subtle frequencies" and "space between notes"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("It's beautiful" pursues connection). Stable close-3rd POV with rhythmic modulation under totality stress. No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in eclipse hush accelerate); high density integrates sensory/action. Minor "ordinary magic" recurrence borders loop but pattern-taught early; no scaffold in climax. Clean propulsion to final planning image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eclipse-music therapy synthesis transforms mutism trope via "starlight" line growing from particulars. Risk in quiet lyric closure heightens fragile stakes without gimmick. Fresh angle on wonder via "dreaming roots" idiom.</comment>
