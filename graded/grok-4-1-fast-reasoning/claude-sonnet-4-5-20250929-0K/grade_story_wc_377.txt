<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied reactions like her chest tightening at the "unbearably human" sound, revealing contradictory impulses toward perfect vs. imperfect tones; final renunciation of technical mastery for human honesty earned via ice's causal role. Micro-choices in adjusting mechanisms under wind show flawed competence balanced by wonder. No safety-hedging; seasonal muteness constrains without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ice placement → glistening → richer tones → pilgrim arrival → realization reconfigures "symphonies of truth" premise with melting cost legible in "half its original size" line. Single scene anchored early (climbing switchback by ~100 words). Closure as CR pays off disorientation waiver with charged final vibration image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clouds "rolled beneath her boots like a pale ocean" and wind-driven arms constrain adjustments, charging final bell-touch image; sensory hierarchy (sonic primacy) reflects bell-tuner's bias. Details evolve causally (ice film on bells). Micro-setting (sculpture/ice) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete sculpture for truth symphonies) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ice-deepening that narrows perfect-tone options, forcing endurance of imperfections with felt cost in melting and "unbearably human" layer. Agency in unpacking/adjusting; no coincidence resolution. Moral calculus (honesty vs. precision) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved via imperfect sound emerges implicitly from ice-to-bell progression, reweighting word-era loss in pilgrim faces and final "wordless smile" without moralizing. Returning ice motif shifts from archival prop to honest catalyst. Complexity lingers in muted passions' revival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with sonic perceptual signature ("cascading tones that spoke"); rhythm modulates from descriptive to resonant (e.g., stars-bell convergence). Sign language at dusk carries subtext; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture purposeful, lyric without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moisture created a thin film... sound that emerged made Mira's chest tighten"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("joy threaded with sorrow") in mid-beats purposeful for textural lens, not muddling pressure peaks. Propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-verbal world, memory-ice, kinetic bells transforms silence trope into wonder-preservation via human-imperfection turn; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes. No template echoes; conceptual integrity commits to sonic truth premise.</comment>
