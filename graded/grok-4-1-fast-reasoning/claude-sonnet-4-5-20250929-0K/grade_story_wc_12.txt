<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Calloway's particular theology and micro-choices with loop pedal and palette reveal contradictory impulses toward control via stillness; Marcus's flickers earn the final endurance without tidy epiphany. Minor abstractness in emotions embodied more in sound than flesh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound layers and blue marks build density to critical mass; CR closure lands cleanly in "entity...dissolved like a question forgotten," reweighting possession premise with conceptual cost of unrecognized fullness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dimensional overlaps enable air-painting and sound-filling, constraining priest's tactics; recurring cobalt palette charges mandala image at climax, mirroring internal unraveling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pre-completion exorcism signaled early tightens via accumulating layers forcing entity confrontation; agency in rhetorical loops and marks forecloses possession path with felt dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unraveled stillness emerges organically from sound pockets and blue seeds, reweighting control assumptions; final "decorated by silence" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person perceptual signature filters through priest's "muffled clarity," with rhythmic loops mirroring content; purposeful compression in layered prose taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density integrates action/image; minor figurative density in "origami made of light" coherent but borders overwrite in peak layering without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Loop-pedal sound homily transforms exorcism into rhetorical accumulation, bold synthesis of tech-theology in dimensional space feels inevitable; risk heightens stakes via paradox mandala.</comment>
