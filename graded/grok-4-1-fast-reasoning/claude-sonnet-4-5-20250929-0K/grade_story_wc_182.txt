<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marin's expertise as arcane linguist drives micro-choices like proto-linguistic negotiation, revealing values under pressure; time traveler applies secondary pressure without stealing focus. Competent arc with earned change via exchange proposal, but lacks overt contradictory impulses in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (dust maps, transformed readers) builds to RR closure in symphony shift and diary filling, with conceptual cost of exchanged knowledge legible in "shelves reorganized themselves." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain bookstore's neural shelves and unheard symphony constrain descent (supplies, markers) and charge final image of reorganizing volumes; sensory hierarchy (bone-resonating frequencies) reflects Marin's linguistic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant rescue stake signaled early tightens via chamber discovery and negotiation, forcing trade-off (consumption to exchange) under accumulative lens; cost felt in transformed eyes carrying "fragments of impossible knowledge."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated unlearned lessons emerges organically via diary seeds and library-as-practice realization; final image of filling pages offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting isolation vs. sharing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mathematical symphonies, proto-languages); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You can hear it too"), rhythm modulates from unease to harmony at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful figurative language (e.g., "shelves branching like neural pathways") without muddle or loops; propulsion aligns with descent's mounting frequencies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living bookstore and unlearned lessons transforms tropes via linguistic negotiation and quantum vines; risk of sentient architecture pays off in charged exchange without gimmickry.</comment>
