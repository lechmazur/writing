<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's embodied "uncertainly certain" fingers and trust in patterns show contradictory impulses acting in scene; final choice to preserve fractures earned by chamber causality with visible cost of abandoning restoration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as piece pattern density breaks at chamber discovery; compass-to-window-to-door motivated ellipsis narrows to CR closure reconfiguring repair premise with conceptual cost in final preservation image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall mist constrains tool longevity while roar mirrors rhythm shift; swirling leaves and chamber charts as micro-settings part and charge pivotal door reveal and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coincidence-to-pattern stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through piece arrivals and compass point, deepening to chamber force renunciation of precision with felt cost in fracture preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Admiral's note reweights "broken clock right twice daily" into resonant non-literal answer on uncertainty without moralizing; final compass image charges thematic complexity organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in leaf-watching drifts and pattern-noticing; rhythmic diction like "swirling leaves that never quite settled" modulates purposefully without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and reflection without loops or scaffolds; final "pointing everywhere and nowhere" line varies rhythm to recharge closure crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chronometric map synthesizing broken instruments into chaos-navigation premise feels inevitable and fresh; transforms clock/compass tropes through tinkerer's arc without hedging.</comment>
