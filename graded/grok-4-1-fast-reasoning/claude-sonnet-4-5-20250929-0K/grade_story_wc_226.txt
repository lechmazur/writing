<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—artistic rebellion vs. ritual demand—act simultaneously in poetry sessions and elder confrontation; final hand on spire and whisper earn renunciation of simplicity with cost of uncertain absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via echoing layers to Charged Poise closure; elder's "You corrupt" echoing "conduct" tightens meaningfully; final "I forge through you" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of fractured truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon echoes constrain confessions and enable refraction tactics across beats; pale spire's hum under hand charges final image, filtering through artist's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of artistic forgiveness vs. ritual clarity signaled early, deepens via group sessions drawing elder pressure; poetry refraction forces trade-off, with legible cost in potential ritual failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism theme emerges from echo refractions like "I watched him fall into grace"; final whisper-echo offers non-literal reconfiguration of forgiveness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Artist's lyrical perceptual signature ("prisms of interpretation") stable in third-person limited; elder dialogue subtext via echoes advances conflict naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Layered echo transformations like "clarity...charity...disparity" deliver high density and rhythmic propulsion without loops or muddle in peak elder beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echoes subverting elder ("You conduct the ritual") offers fresh synthesis of acoustic world logic with confession stakes; risks poetic defiance heightening closure coherence.</comment>
