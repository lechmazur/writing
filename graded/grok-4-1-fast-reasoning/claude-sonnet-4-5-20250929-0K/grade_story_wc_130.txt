<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer's interiority shines in embodied grief (optimism "breaking surface like a seed through stone"), with contradictory impulses—desperate search vs. dawning acceptance—acting simultaneously in the ritual, earning the final renunciation with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through image density to CR closure ("mapped its territory—that was enough"), with cost legible in the warm eyes and foreclosed full resolution; orientation anchored early in cavern orchard under moonlight; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment> Cavern orchard with dripping stalactites constrains ritual (metronome rhythm, moonlight angles for prime shadows) and charges final image ("orchard waited... alive as grief"); sensory details (silver milk light, glowing fruit) filtered through POV inventive grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify brother's ambiguous loss) deepens accumulatively via glass eyes ritual and double vision, forcing stance crystallization in acceptance; one tightening (blossoms opening, glimpsed figure) narrows to conceptual cost without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss's topology emerges organically from orchard equations and vision, with final image ("silence could be companionship") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting absence as dimension; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature mathematical-emotive ("love quantified... by the shape of its absence"); rhythmic control modulates from whispered calculations to charged poise; purposeful compression taught early fits accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("moonlight struck the damaged surfaces... shadows formed numbers"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful in lyric mode without muddle in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, prime-shadow mosaic, and emotion-topology math transforms loss trope; cavern orchard as emotional lab feels inevitable, with risk-taking lyric closure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
