<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Margot's motivation intensifies credibly from clutching the clasp to confessing fears, earning her realization with embodied cost; advisor applies targeted pressure via the dictionary. Internal conflict embodied in paradoxical notes aligning with her cursed sight. Minor stock traits in advisor prevent 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and confessions builds to CR closure where fear materializes as "pathetically small," reweighting premise with cost of exposure. Orientation anchored early in funhouse; single scene tightens via one deepening (notes → unbosoming). Cost legible in clasp flaring hot.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain climax by enabling cursed sight to capture fear's form; dust motes and warped glass charge atmosphere and final empty reflections. Sensory details (moonlight, echoing voice) selective via POV urgency. Environment evolves with her wandering, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (conquer fear) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dictionary notes to confession deepening knowledge of fear's size; agency in unbosoming forecloses running path. Cost felt in clasp's heat and advisor's satisfied laughter. One tightening sufficient, no micro turns.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of fear's illusory size emerges organically from particulars (tiny parasite revealed behind shoulder); final image of empty mirrors reconfigures without moralizing. Subtext in paradoxical notes and clasp's scream avoids binaries. Advisor line near echo but earned via action.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (cursed sight capturing luminance/details); voice modulates poetically yet controlled under stress. Advisor dialogue distinct (silk/gravel) with subtext; no head-hopping. Rhythmic diction heightens repulsive allure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (smile "wound opening," fear "tiny parasite"). Minor density in opening descriptions but no loops or artifacts in peak confession/closure. Propulsion clear, no scaffold in final clasp beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed memory and fear as small parasite in carnival mirrors transforms tropes; clasp's evolving glow risks poetic conceit successfully. Non-obvious CR (seeing clearly exposes weakness) inevitable from particulars. Bold tone sustains ingenuity.</comment>
