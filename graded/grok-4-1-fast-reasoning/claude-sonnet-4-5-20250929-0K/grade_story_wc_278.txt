<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's guilt over ignored baby cries drives concrete micro-choices like pressing amber to port; contradictory impulses (research vs. life) act in the firmware work, earning the rewriting of her constellation with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds sound-density to RR closure in machine's hum-to-peace and wasp's flight; cost legible in "every sound she'd failed to hear" resolved via on-page rewriting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lab's crystalline sounds and amber constrain choice at central port; charges final empty amber image mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Guilt-stake deepens accumulatively via curator's prompt and code-sorrow reveal, Vera's agency in keywork foreclosing past dissonance with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cries-to-melody arc emerges implicitly; final "amber... clear and empty" reweights listening/guilt without moral, resonant via wasp's tethered flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation peaks cleanly in "dissonance hushing into harmony."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels without loops; minor opening figurative density ("moth wings and rust") purposeful, peak closure prose muddle-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-crystals and firmware-sorrow transforms guilt trope; time-folding lab risks heighten stakes organically to inevitable amber bridge.</comment>
