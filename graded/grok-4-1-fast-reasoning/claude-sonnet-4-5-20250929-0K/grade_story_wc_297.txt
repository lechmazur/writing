<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and complementary traits (Mira's depth vs. Marcus's breadth) drive the merger, with scars revealing character under pressure; final shared dream earns change via prior causality. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("anxious elation") slightly abstracts peak interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visionary fragments density-build to RR closure in clipping's crumble and new growth, reconfiguring separate dreams with conceptual cost of dissolved order. Orientation anchors early (cobalt glade, dusk); single scene coherent, no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's spirals tighten in response to merger, constraining and charging final image; selective sensory palette (bruised purples, pulsing grass) mirrors internal reconfiguration purposefully. No white-room; lived-in via glade's causal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream intersection post-covenant) signaled early, tightens via scar-linking cascade that narrows solo visions; agency in palm-press forecloses isolation with clipping's dissolution as felt cost. Accumulative deepening reweights under lens, though external pressure leans abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of complementary limits forging new covenant emerges organically from merger; final shared dream offers resonant CR to "waiting vs. now" without moralizing, reweighting root-bound/scattered binaries via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (Mira's tangled dreams filtering Marcus's visions); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in jolt/cascade. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("Link with me"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short jolts in cascade, breathing final image); high density integrates image/action. Purposeful lyric metaphors taught early avoid muddle, but occasional figurative density borders overwrite in opening glade beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary tropes via scars/topiary mechanics transforms prophecy into tactile merger; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early clippings/scars.</comment>
