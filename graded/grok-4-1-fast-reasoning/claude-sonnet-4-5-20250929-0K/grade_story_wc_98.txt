<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in dream fragments recognizing lost patterns, compelling the planting choice with felt cost of forsaking pure skepticism; Prem's pressure reveals Kima's hierarchy of values without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds dream density to Charged Poise CR in seed planting and "luminous doubt" realization; cost legible in "lose the seed forever," reconfiguring verification role with undeniable conceptual price on darkening horizon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge's crimson blooms as ancestor calendar constrain planting before monsoon, charging final hum/palms image; sensory selection (petals, steam, soil) filters through Kima's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect memory tightens accumulatively via dream deepening, narrowing skeptic options; agency in kneeling/planting forecloses doubt-path with legible risk/cost under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth/wish convergence emerges organically from dream web to final "faith and verification bloom," reweighting premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity in ridge hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward whimsical fragments; dialogue subtext (Prem's "stalling") pursues goals naturally, voice modulating rhythmically without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "seed dropped... with a whisper"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent/purposeful in peak planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "empirically whimsical" reality-checking transforms memory trope via dream genetics and ridge calendar; risk in leap charges closure organically.</comment>
