<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's embodied contradiction—phantom roar versus tuning fork vibrations—fuels micro-choices like pressing to surfaces, earning her endurance in the final book reveal. Interiority particular via thermal hues tied to memories. Chen applies pressure without forcing speech, crystallizing her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from personal strikes to public panels, tightening via chronological maps into Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "jagged reds... softer hues," reconfiguring loss. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass fractures and tuning fork constrain choices, mirroring grief in "deep purples" to hope's "pink dawn." Final image charges via fork case against heart amid ruins. Sensory bias via Mara's vibration-feel selective and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through experiments to installation, narrowing to embodied patterns with cost of permanent loss felt in throat memory. Protagonist agency in strikes/presses drives deepening. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via heat landscapes reweighting silence/music premise, resonant in book motifs shifting hues without statement. Final fork-to-heart offers non-literal answer to survival's frequency. Particulars like ferry horn acceleration avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: vibrations over sound, heat blooms as notice. Lyrical rhythm modulates from roar to resonance, diction controlled. No head-hopping; elision of sound purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; rhythm varies without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in thermal descriptions purposeful, not muddled. Propulsion peaks in installation beats without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms disability trope via heat-mapping in ruins, tuning fork as unshaken anchor synthesizing emotion/tech organically. Risky lyric accumulative frame heightens conceptual stakes. Fresh premise inevitable in hindsight via body-heat symphony.</comment>
