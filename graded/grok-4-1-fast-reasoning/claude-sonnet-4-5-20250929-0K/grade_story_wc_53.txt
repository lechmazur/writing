<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—scavenging fragments vs. confronting her ghost—act simultaneously in the scene, earning the final hand-taking with the dropped wheel as visible cost. Interiority particular via embodied collection (trembling hands on fragments). Flaw of eroded purpose drives inevitable scavenging mistakes that compound to acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds to Resonant Reconfiguration (ghost integration) with legible cost in wheel's fall and lagoon's pause. Orientation anchored early (~50 words: Mira on platform post-carousel). Closure reconfigures erosion into resolute acceptance without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon constrains ghost's approach and charges final image (stills, then moves), mirroring internal fractured stillness through suspended droplets and spiraling water. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: scavenger notices floating words amid mist. Recurring platform/lagoon evolves causally with ghost's walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost amid eroded ambitions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment collection to ghost's approach/whisper, forcing agency in hand-taking with wheel-drop cost. Pressure coheres texturally, foreclosing disintegration path. Escalation driven by Mira's endurance under rising spectral inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-disintegration emerges organically from fragments and lagoon, reweighted non-literally in final integration ("You were never meant to go back") without moralizing. Ghost's armor of purpose contrasts Mira's scavenging for resonant complexity. Closing image answers erosion with acceptance, lingering ambiguity on music's return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (floating words, mist-regret) modulates rhythmically under stress, stable single POV. Purposeful compression of time/memory elided early, paid off in ghost whisper. Diction biased to scavenger's fractured idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm (short peak stress: "Time collapsed."); no loops, purposeful "fractured stillness" pattern-taught early. Minor figurative density in lagoon descriptions integrated without muddle. Closure image clear, varied openings propel to music's hint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Surreal scavenger of overheard stories transforms trope of lost ambition via kinetic physics and ghost negotiation, inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric accumulation risks non-linearity but heightens stakes coherently. Fresh synthesis: carousel halt as disintegration mask.</comment>
