<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (yearning for stability vs terror of it) act in scene via graffiti choice, earning final stance to teach newcomer; foundation stone anchors motivation with embodied weight in pocket at closure. Interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from backstory to community shift to charged poise closure where Marina's welcoming gesture reconfigures newcomer integration with felt cost of "hopeful desperation" in final lines. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft platforms, calliope music, and graffiti walls constrain choices (parades block boats, codes coordinate) and charge final image as Marina gestures at painted secrets. Sensory hierarchy reflects carnival priorities; micro-setting (stone chip) mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve chaotic resistance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via reorganization deepening community action; final poise forecloses sanitization path with cost of constant adaptation legible in "hopeful desperation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of living culture vs static preservation emerges organically; final image of welcoming newcomer to "really see" graffiti non-literally answers central question, reweighting prior gentrification pressure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (carnival logic in noticing painted faces, smells); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to swelling music at end; final dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure—final swelling music and rocking platforms propel cleanly. Prose integrates sensory propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-city carnival resistance via graffiti codes transforms gentrification trope; risk in encoding traditional symbols heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at community reclamation.</comment>
