<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to transform silence into possibility roots consistently in traits like hands "remembering every curve" and drives higher-stakes completion of crown; embodied in singing and soldering under solitude pressure. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal integration beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered remnant density to cadence shift; orientation anchored early in train/desert oasis. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with spinning crown's "quietly persistent music" reconfiguring silence, cost felt in ongoing solitude as he "reaches for his next piece."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Train remnants and wind bells constrain salvaging choices, shaping tactics for crown build; desert oasis/cottonwoods charge final "misting hush... like grace" image. Sensory hierarchy (chiming, gleaming) reflects carpenter's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to realize silence-as-possibility signaled early, deepens under textural lens via fragment's perfect fit/singing leading to spin tightening; agency in push/solder forecloses incomplete path. Cost of persistent solitude unmistakable in final reaching amid completed work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness singing emerges organically from remnant actions/images; final "translation of ruin into revelation" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases to sound/light in silence (e.g., brass "sang—a note so faint"); rhythmic control heightens hush-to-chime modulation, stable third-limited distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via image-action fusion (e.g., "soldered it into place"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors enhance peak spin beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinetic ruin-sculpture from circus remnants/oasis transforms abandonment tropes; halo's song adds non-obvious renewal inflection charging close.</comment>
