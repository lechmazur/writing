<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—freezing somatic reactions versus "pearl of stillness" endurance—act in scene, earning stasis closure with persistent grief cost; embodied details like throat-tightening jasmine avoid labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from markers to visitor exchange, landing Charged Poise closure in final greenhouse image where "seedlings waited...roots ready to anchor"; legible cost in unrelieved missing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum and defunct lighthouse mirror/charge survival, constraining blooms in "salt-kissed air" and final "ocean...sang its endless song"; selective sensory integration via Mira's priorities elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief transformation deepens accumulatively through marker triggers to practiced stillness and couple interaction, forcing endurance trade-off; cost legible in "never stop missing them" persisting to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl motif emerges organically from oyster irritant to "holding grief and hope simultaneously," reweighting premise non-literally in seedlings image without moralizing; lighthouse parallel enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with plant-biased perceptual signature ("impossible blooms...stubborn soil"); brief dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing couple's understanding from Mira's reserve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (e.g., short punchy freezes amid lyrical layers); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, propelling to "luminous...layer at a time" closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms trauma survival into "pearl of stillness" cultivation against obsolescent lighthouse; risks lyric endurance, inevitable in hindsight via somatic-grounded arc.</comment>
