<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in earned change: hands "move without permission" into spinning, revealing muscle memory over heartbreak with visible emotional cost in crying/laughing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from approach to courtyard spinning; closure as Charged Poise in final lanterns/chant lands with cost of embracing "rags of failure," reconfiguring path forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaics (*Let the shoulder lead*), primrose, and kerosene knot constrain choices and charge final image of whirling knot amid lanterns; sensory details (petals closing vs. flames burning) mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hopelessness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via woman's explanation and Kael yielding to "hands remember," forcing trade-off of past shame for present motion with legible cost in tears/laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "filtering forward" emerges organically from accident ash to lantern glow; final image of "primrose petals closed... lanterns burned on" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting failure as creative darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with fireworks-designer perceptual signature (rhythmic chants, geometry of motion); woman's dialogue subtextual ("Your hands remember") advances stakes; rhythmic prose modulates beautifully under rising awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm—no loops or scaffolds; metaphors like "hopelessness... like smoke" purposeful without muddle; peak spinning beat clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of failed artists' commune and fire-spinning redemption transforms tropes; risk in "ambient awareness" method heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via knot's reprise.</comment>
