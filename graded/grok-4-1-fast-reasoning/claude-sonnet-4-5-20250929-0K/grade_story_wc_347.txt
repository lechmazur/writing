<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as reluctant caretaker intensifies compellingly through micro-choices like choosing the "wrong" cliff-edge path; interiority concrete in lines like "bark rough as grief." Earned change to seeing orchard as gift forecloses burden with felt duty cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak flight slightly limits emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: nut/shadow discoveries build density to CR closure where "not a burden, but a gift" reweights premise with ongoing duty cost, legible in starlit nut image. Orientation anchored early in orchard/cliffside. Single tightening via blueprint realization suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard/trees/rots constrain choices (shadow alignment at junction dictates path); frost/birds as micro-setting force tactical shifts. Sensory hierarchy narrows to auditory wing-beats, tactile nut in fading light. Final stars/nut image charges closure; lived-in navigation via branches/roots elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost/birds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening blueprint knowledge narrowing paths/options. Agency in snatching nut/aligning shadows drives one decisive tightening; birds' descent/frost creep legibly raise cost in "bronze beaks designed to tear." Coheres to Charged Poise at safe exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty/curse-as-gift emerges organically from orchard particulars (gnarled trees, nuts) shifting via struggle to resonant final nut-to-stars realization without moralizing. Subtext in "ugliness and purpose intertwined" reweights inheritance. Protagonist arc inextricable from question; ambiguity lingers in eternal birds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (landscape as "compass needles," "graceless beauty"); diction/rhythm modulate from reflective to urgent ("She ran... birds descended"). Minimal dialogue natural/goal-driven ("Follow me"); no head-hopping, free indirect clean. Voice distinct, biased to orchard's secrets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "rolled the small nut... studying its markings" advances plot/character/atmosphere). Rhythm varies read-aloud; no loops/artifacts, metaphors purposeful ("sun bleeding orange"). Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught/pays off; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: orchard-as-assembled-blueprint navigated via nuts/shadows transforms maze trope ingeniously, inevitable in hindsight. Risky tone (graceless beauty) heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, bold premise commitment to mechanical birds/orchard memory. Final reconfiguration grows from particulars.</comment>
