<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emilia's scientific skepticism clashes with grief-driven engagement, compelling her to plant and eat the fruit; contradictory impulses act in the growth observation, earning the final perceptual shift to legacy planning with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, observation density tightens to fruit ingestion CR, reweighting grief as transformation; closure image of planning carries conceptual cost of altered perception, with seed constraint persisting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arbor's magnetic fields ripple with growth and hum at close, constraining high-altitude observation and charging final railing image; sensory selectivity (charged air, metallic taste) reflects POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of understanding transition deepens via fruit flood under Accumulative lens, narrowing options from doubt to acceptance; agency in plucking/eating forecloses skepticism with felt perceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of state transformation emerges via accumulating analogies (cuneiform, arbor suspension), offering resonant CR in final planning without moral; reweights loss as ongoing perception shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person voice holds perceptual signature of analogical science, modulating rhythm from restrained grief to "electromagnetic" revelation; diction specificity heightens pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates revelation ("silver leaves that caught sunlight and refracted it into colors Emilia had no names for") with propulsion; zero loops, varied rhythm supports closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky-garden arbor encoding consciousness via ancient physics analogies synthesizes fresh sci-fi metaphorically; risk of impossible growth pays off in inevitable CR, heightening thematic stakes.</comment>
