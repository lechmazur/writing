<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (resist sliding consciousness vs. embrace as navigation) act vividly in the climax press of palm to fragment, earning her final acceptance with the cost of lost photographs as anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from fragment pulse to explosive light and garden reconfiguration, landing CR closure ("The photographs were gone, but she didn't need them anymore") with legible conceptual cost of erased past yielding complete maze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's living roots and bridge railing constrain choices (embed fragment, weave geometries), charging final image as they twist in response to her touch, mirroring hyperbolic time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map time's texture) signaled early via mazes; her agency in touching fragment to photo tightens pressure under Accumulative lens, deepening knowledge with on-page cost of disintegrating anchors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as navigable hyperbolic maze emerges organically; final image ("time felt like soil after rain") offers resonant CR repricing her existence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with geometric perceptual signature ("hyperbolic geometry, the kind that existed in spaces where parallel lines diverged infinitely") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere seamlessly in climax ("particles spiraling outward in golden streams"), propulsion peaks without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic time-mazes, and botanical response feels inevitable; bold risk in CR closure heightens stakes via garden's on-page reorganization.</comment>
