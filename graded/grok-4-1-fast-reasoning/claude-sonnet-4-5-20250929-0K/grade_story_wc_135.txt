<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory hope/complication and reactive micro-choices (staggered intervals) compel the valve handover, earning her realization that the archive heartens returnees with visible emotional cost in Thomas's reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences builds to ship's arrival and valve exchange; Charged Poise closure in "seventeen years...spilled out" reconfigures burden to bridge with felt cost of preserved waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-steamed planks and gleaming stones constrain staggered observation and mirror internal renewal, charging the final archive image; selective sensory filter reflects archivist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving absences for meaning) signaled early; spotting Thomas tightens via recognition, narrowing to personal confrontation with foreclosed erasure option and relational cost legible in Thomas's trembling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absences-into-meaning emerges from particulars (valve, boxes); final image non-literally answers preservation's purpose, reweighting premise with emotional cost of endured solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward fragments/significance; dialogue subtextual ("Nothing's gone") pursues goals; rhythm modulates from measured observation to charged release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; purposeful "staggered intervals" repetition teaches pattern without loops; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archivist-of-absences premise freshly synthesizes waiting/return, transformed via valve's talisman-to-bridge arc; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens stakes through conceptual cost.</comment>
