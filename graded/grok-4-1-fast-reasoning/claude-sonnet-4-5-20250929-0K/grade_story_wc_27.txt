<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and interiority via barefoot sensations and hum vibration; contradictory impulses surface in rebellion critique versus new path. Minor slip: epiphany on rebellion failure feels slightly summative rather than fully dramatized in "they'd been striking at symptoms." Earned change forecloses old tactics with felt cost in final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from circle discovery to symbol alignment; orientation anchored early in spaceport bay details. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "She understood what she needed to do—not reignite... but begin something older," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of abandoning rigid rebellion. Persistent stones/glasses constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: glass crunching under bare feet pressures movement, stones' hum charges realization. Body as micro-setting (toes curled, palm pressed) constrains vulnerability; fading daylight evolves causally, mirroring internal shift. Final glasses raise recharges motifs without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover meaning post-lull) signaled early, deepens texturally via hum escalation and message revelation narrowing to new revolutionary stance. Agency in stepping into circle forecloses old rebellion path; cost legible in "inevitable collapse" realization. Coherent pressure culminates in charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of seeing beyond wreckage emerges organically from debris pattern, hum, and message; final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Penalty for near-explicit thesis in quoted symbols ("Remember what you were before you forgot how to see"), echoing prompt-like language in climax. Subtext layers rebellion as symptom in barefoot vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: pattern-seeking gaze, somatic hum resonance. Rhythmic control modulates from serene sweep to enveloping intensity; purposeful compression in discoveries maintains propulsion. No head-hopping; voice specificity elevates barefoot philosophy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glass crunching beneath her bare feet" advances setting, character, momentum); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Zero loops/artifacts; purposeful "thunderous serenity" motif propels cadence. Precision in sensory hierarchy under dusk urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient stone circle in sci-fi spaceport wreckage transforms tropes via barefoot mystic rebellion pivot. Risky quiet CR heightens stakes through hum frequency outlasting empires. Inevitable hindsight: glasses align symbols to reweight failure as blindness.</comment>
