<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in her refusal to burn the plaza (backstory anchored to present via tiles) and steel hands cradling tesserae as children, earning the final preservation choice with shaking embodiment as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from tile-tracing memory loops to density-tightened mosaic completion; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page when "something shifted in the air" and loop loosens, with regime threat as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shattered sky and mosaic chips constrain choices (patterns reveal names/resistance) and charge final image of plaza "remember[ing] itself whole"; sensory hierarchy via Layla's augmented touch filters urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape retrocognitive trap) signaled early, escalates via pattern-deepening that fractures loop, driven by agency in arranging/speaking names; cost unmistakable in shaking and future regime pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance weaponized against erasure emerges organically from naming dead, culminating in non-literal final answer ("Memorial of Unbroken Names") that reweights mercy's power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tile-pattern reading and memory immersion; rhythmic control modulates from loop-trap tension to charged poise, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short declarative names amid poetic sky imagery) propels without loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere (sky "fractured like broken glass" echoes tiles) in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive punishment and mosaic-naming resistance transforms post-apoc tropes; steel hands' pivot from destruction to preservation feels inevitable, with lyric risk heightening closure.</comment>
