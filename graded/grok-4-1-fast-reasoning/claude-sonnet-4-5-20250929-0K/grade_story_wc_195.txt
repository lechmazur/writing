<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the knight's past flight versus present dance through patterns, earning the final allegiance with embodied cost in shivering bliss spreading from fingertips; interiority particular via string visions others deny. Flawless micro-choices like unsnapping armor reveal values under pressure. No label-speak or tidy paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via reality shifts building density to Charged Poise closure; program discovery anchors orientation by ~100 words, program's dissolution and final oath murmur deliver CR with conceptual cost of ending withdrawal. No orientation debt; lens taught early in shifting trees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical fruit (golden humming to silver singing) and reorganizing trees constrain choices, forming amphitheater stage that charges final image; sensory hierarchy (ache in teeth, factually mystical glow) filters via knight's watchful POV. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solitude vs. open-eyed duty) signaled in disgrace backstory, escalates accumulatively via program/strings attaching, tightening to dance that forecloses withdrawal with felt bliss/cost; agency in completing patterns narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen motion amid inevitable strings emerges organically from program image, forgotten patterns, and final greenhouse-as-stage realization; resonant non-literal answer in dancing knight reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on cosmic choreographers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-watching; rhythmic prose modulates from watchful observation to ecstatic murmur, syntax reflecting withdrawn-to-engaged mind without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., armor falls "like curtains closing"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, though minor metaphor density in shifts (reality "breathing") stays coherent/voice-motivated without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly oaths with marionette fate in alchemical reality-shifts transforms tropes; forgotten patterns and cosmic masters feel inevitable, bold risks heighten stakes via shivering bliss without gimmickry.</comment>
