<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in trembling hands at letters and absorbed "small deaths"; colleagues' misperception reveals internal contradiction without hedging; final research commitment earned by prior note-placing ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure in "Witnessed. Not forgotten." note resealed beside letters; cost legible in personal absorption amid returning tide; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains via tide slack and cracks, mirroring internal loss; inkwell recurs tactilely to charge ascent image; sensory hierarchy (green light, fish, seaweed) POV-filtered through archaeologist's gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of memory vs. official reports deepens accumulatively via musicians' note then letters box; agency in photographing/resealing forecloses forgetting with felt emotional cost; single tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interlaced absence theme emerges from note placements and unsent letters, resolved non-literally in warm inkwell against heart; complexity in patient water's "inexorably absence" avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature like "hushed blaze" and patina as loss; rhythmic modulation accelerates in discovery beat; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in lines like "quiet as held breath, yet burning"; varied rhythm propels silt shift to ascent without loops; figurative consistency (mourning veils, cathedral light) pattern-taught, no muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surveyor-as-dream-archaeologist premise transforms erosion trope via note-sealing ritual; fresh synthesis of absence into architecture inevitable in letters discovery and resolve.</comment>
