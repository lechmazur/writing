<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of foresight/hindsight vs. present drive micro-choices like pressing seals; transcendence earned with cost of dissolved directive at "She pressed her own dreams into a fresh wafer seal."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream density reconfigures time perception; CR closure at final wafer-pressing with conceptual cost of unified landscape legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and storm constrain entry/arrival, charging final inside/outside image of transcendence vs. rage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vision-deepening under Accumulative lens tightens path-choice stake; agency in seal interactions forecloses fragmented perception with felt transcendence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mycelial paths motif shifts from question to resonant CR answer in "every journey was a collaboration," reweighting premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of paradoxical sight biases noticing (e.g., "forest's own mouth"); rhythmic control heightens visionary peaks without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels insight beats; minor figurative density in dreams (e.g., "drowning in chlorophyll") purposeful but borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wafer-dream archive and mycelial destiny synthesize post-apoc tropes into fresh CR; risk of nonlinear time pays off inevitably.</comment>
