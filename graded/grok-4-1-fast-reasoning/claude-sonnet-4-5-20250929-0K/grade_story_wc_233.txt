<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's contradictory impulses peak when she "wanted to argue, to command" but words dry, earning the final vulnerable acceptance of the wound; embodied emotions like "calcified heart" and trembling fingers ground her arc without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure in "carrying the bleeding starlight inside her like a wound," with legible cost in disenchantment and terror; single scene anchors orientation early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's pulsing stone and weeping starlight constrain choices (e.g., deeper advance into darkness) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (copper air, cold burns) filters via queen's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams/remember feeling) deepens via memory cascade and grotto voice, narrowing to self-witness; shared exhale forces crystallization with terror cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-witness emerges via shifting images (starlight wounds, younger reflection) to non-literal resonant end reweighting power's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("starlight bleeding through fingers like wounds") modulates rhythm under pressure; stable single POV, grotto dialogue carries subtext seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid syntax ("walls wept light"); no loops, metaphors cohere (e.g., "mouth mid-scream"), read-aloud rhythm varies without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grotto as self-summoned psychological mirror transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric fantasy heights closure image without gimmickry.</comment>
