<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and contradictory impulses in bug releases, earning final renunciation of possessions for purpose; "She had nothing left to give except direction" shows hierarchy of values with cost. Minor reflection heaviness doesn't flatten pressure as anchored to present actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via bug releases paralleling planets; CR closure in realization of granular transformation reconfigures identity, cost legible in "nothing left to give." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via man encounter suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand's warmth and volcano's "vibrant hush" constrain location for prophecy-fulfillment and charge final image mirroring transformation; sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding transformation accumulates via progressive releases narrowing to full divestment; cost felt in emptied jars foreclosing past self under textural lens. Brief man interaction complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gradual transformation emerges organically from bugs, sand, planets; final image of bugs as "tiny transformation of chemistry into light" reweights premise non-literally with destitution's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in textured noticing ("granular, like black sand"); brief dialogue natural, subtext-driven. Rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful figurative layering ("constellation that mirrored the planets") propels without muddle, ear-test clean throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bugs as personal constellations with volcano's hush transforms philanthropy trope; risk in lyric accumulative close heightens stakes organically.</comment>
