<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Painter's motivation to thresh meaning drives obsessive painting and trail-following, with embodied skepticism (wryly holding pulsing brooch) yielding to earned shift at cave realization. Contradictory impulses (dismiss mysticism yet follow) act in scene, compelling higher-stakes night walk. Final communion renunciation of insomnia-as-curse forecloses isolation path with felt artistic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rain trails and discoveries tightens to CR closure in cave pool ("The convergence wasn't mystical. It was memory"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of eternal human striving. Orientation anchored early (Skellig Minor, post-wars dawn). One meaningful deepening via brooch-to-cave ellipsis narrows to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain trails and tidal causeway constrain choices (painting then following in darkness), mirroring internal chaos and charging final handprint/pool image. Sensory hierarchy (branching mudflats like neurons) reflects painter's priorities, vivid and POV-filtered. Tidal flooding isolates, evolving with events to heighten vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern-deepening (brooch tingle → cave pool) that forces realization-stance, foreclosing skepticism with cost of reframed insomnia. Agency in trail-following tests commitment; Marcus rejection complicates without resolving. Visible price (night walk exposure) alters tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-seeking across wars emerges implicitly via trails/handprints/paintings, CR pool realization reweighting "thresh meaning" without moral—past beauty meets survival awe. Subtext in brooch glow and haggard faces invites ambiguity on mysticism vs. memory. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns as neurons, haggard awe idiom); diction/rhythm modulate from wry skepticism to charged wonder. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Marcus's "island takes; gives" pursues goal indirectly). No head-hopping; voice distinct even in brief Marcus beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: purposeful rain-trail recurrence builds texture without loops. Rhythm varies (short cave sentences heighten revelation); no artifacts dull closure pool image. Concrete images (ochre handprints mirroring stars) replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal mysticism transformed via rain-memory patterns and painter's art, risking quiet CR over action climax. Haggard awe idiom and unearthed brooch inflect tropes organically. Non-obvious island exchange logic heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
