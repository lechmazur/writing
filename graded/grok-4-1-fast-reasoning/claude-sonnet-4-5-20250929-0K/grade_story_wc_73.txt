<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's grim optimism and "balancedly daring" trait drive contradictory impulses—climbing as punishment yet seeing seeds of success—culminating in the earned sideways step and email send with visible cost of renewed risk. Interiority concrete via physics lens on dice and proofs. Vision's pressure reveals flaws without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from endless climb to dice roll, vision dialogue, and void step as Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "infinite futures" hesitation before send. Orientation anchored early (Mara climbing with dice). Single-shard dream-to-wake transition coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains escape (no up/down), dice chip catches sourceless light to charge final desk image. Sensory narrowing under stress (cold stone, clattering upward). POV bias filters via physics (defying Euclidean geometry, gravity).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome risk aversion) signaled in climb/reflection, tightens via vision's "hedged every bet" to agency in sideways step/email send under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable: "even if we fail" forecloses safe career. Internal want (safety) vs. need (discovery) interweaves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of dynamic instability over perfect equilibrium emerges via dice imperfection and proofs, resonant in final "waited for the world to move" without moralizing. Subtext in vision dialogue reweights prior abandonment. Dice/staircase particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with physics-perceptual signature ("symphony of variables," "mathematics of her fall"). Dialogue subtextual (vision prods without declaring thesis). Rhythmic control modulates from rhythmic climb to clipped wake-up send.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., dice roll embodies stakes, defies gravity). Varied rhythm, no loops; specific verbs/nouns propel (clattered upward, shuddered). Clean mechanics, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: perpetual motion as internalized dream-staircase transforms trope into grim-optimist arc, with dice imperfection enabling bold sideways escape. Risky infinite setting heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via proofs motif.</comment>
