<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern breaks (constellations drifting, flowers zigzagging) to RR closure; echo crystallization reconfigures stakes with internal cost in final chest-nesting image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains via nodes, flowers, and frequencies that amplify and zigzag, charging the silence-casting choice and hunt's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to capture raw echo tightens via feral garden response and presence entry, driven by Mara's silence-shaping agency; cost legibly nests frequency in her bones.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Being held while falling" echo reweights translation premise as resonant non-literal answer, emerging from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature ("shaped it like longing") and rhythmic modulation under intensity sustain distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via purposeful figures like "frequencies collided... harmonics that shouldn't exist"; zero loops, varied rhythm enhances closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voicing silence to fish goddess echoes synthesizes surreal sound-world organically, transforming tropes with inevitable closure payoff.</comment>
