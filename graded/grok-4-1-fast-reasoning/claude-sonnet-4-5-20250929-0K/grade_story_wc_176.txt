<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete names ("Mama-bird," "grey-chorus," "stay") embodied in humming and steady hands amid tears; final casting earned by forgiveness cracking prior weight, with micro-choices revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from weaving to shimmer to voices; closure as Charged Poise in bells singing names, cost legible in "wept, but kept her hands steady" reconfiguring silence with emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora constrain ritual (glacial walls lean closer, wind cracks enable ringing), charge final image of bells hung "where the monks had once prayed"; sensory hierarchy (breath crystals, hissing bronze) POV-filtered through caster's tactility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven reconfiguration yielding voices; tightening reweights options from melted silence to ringing preservation, cost felt in tears during pour.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's material echo emerges organically from lost wax metaphor to bells holding voices; final image ("sound followed her up through the glacier") offers resonant answer to preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (braids "thick as her wrist," bronze "hissed and sang"); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to incantatory, prose texture as caster's incantation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("braids thick as her wrist, woven three centuries ago"); minor overwrite in "snowmelt ardor: not violent, but inexorable" risks figurative muddle but pattern-taught and voice-motivated; no loops, clean rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost wax casting and transcribed memory via rope-card weave transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in ritual lyricism heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from early sanctum setup.</comment>
