<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when crystallization halts via grandmother's small magics, earning the final transformation of scars into stories with embodied cost in steady hands. Interiority particularizes scholarly dismissal against inherited fear. No safety-hedging; flaws drive struggle without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to RR closure in "a living text, a story that had learned to read itself," reweighting fear with cost of scars retained as wisdom. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating platform's stone table constrains knocking/tracing choices; crystallizing knuckles as body-setting charge reversal image "blood returning to transparent stone." Sensory hierarchy fits scholar's priorities (quill, ink, runes). Details evolve causally to rain without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars) signaled early tightens via hand reversal, forcing micro-choices under Accumulative lens; cost legible in pulsing scars that "no longer ached." Agency in rune-tracing forecloses fear path. No abstract stakes or coincidences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges via rune particulars shifting scars from pain to wisdom; final image "no longer afraid of storms" non-literally answers "everything—even fear...could be transformed." No moralizing; ambiguity in retained scars lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in rune descriptions ("liquid moonlight"); rhythm modulates from hush to thunder without filter excess. Prose as character reflects scholar's precision. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent under pressure ("frost on winter glass"); varied syntax propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle or template cadence in peak rune beats. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with ritual cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune scholarship and folk superstitions transforms scar trope via tea-ink ritual; risk in solo internalized arc heightens emotional stakes. No derivative templates; premise feels inevitable in "scars into stories."</comment>
