<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Teacher's contradictory life (backward aging, forward teaching) drives pivotal revelation with embodied sadness in "She smiled, sad and knowing," earning closure choice; student's passive reception fits mentee role without flattening pressure. Minor slip: student's fear embodied early but fades without micro-choice under trance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ripples to trance-revealed voids, tightening to CR closure "I already have... knowledge lives forward" with conceptual cost of forgetting legible in final exchange; single scene coherent, orientation anchored by platform/pond ~80 words in.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pond ripples and platform drift constrain revelation (trance viewing, star alignment) and charge final descent image; sensory hush, magnetic hum selective via teacher's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach vanishing via appearing) signaled early, textural escalation in trance-deepened ripple voids narrows perception to "spaces between," forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in teacher's forward-passing despite backward loss, though student agency limited to endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of delayed revelation emerges organically from withheld-then-granted pond insight, reweighting backward life in CR ending without statement; resonant ambiguity in forgetting lingers via particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (poetic bias to patterns/hush) modulates rhythmically; dialogue subtextual ("I will withhold nothing") advances goal, distinct voices (teacher's hush vs. student's direct "Will you forget?").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image-embedded action; purposeful ripple repetition teaches pattern without loops, though minor figurative density in grotto hum risks slight overwrite pre-trance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Backward-aging teacher synthesizing ripples/magnetism for vanishing lesson transforms trope into fresh conceptual frame; risk of lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in "platform began its slow descent."</comment>
