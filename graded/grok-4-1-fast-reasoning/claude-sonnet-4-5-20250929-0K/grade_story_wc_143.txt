<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chen's purposefully curious trait drives micro-choices like chemical setup and grain placement, earning testimony role; embodied tears and trembling reveal contradictory melancholy vs. composure without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density tightening via grain etching revelation ("What we witness, we carry forward"), yielding CR closure in superimposed photo image with destruction cost legible in extinction and tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonflowers in crater constrain final shot and grain placement, charging extinction cost; summit timer (90 minutes) and safe zone force tactical retreat, mirroring internal melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>90-minute clock and flower extinction deepen stake to testimony, forcing chemical timing trade-off; agency in grain placement crystallizes endurance with on-page tears as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of grain as "pixel of testimony" offers resonant CR to remembrance vs. destruction question, reweighting craters-as-wounds motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scientific-melancholic perceptual signature ("craters...each a wound") modulates rhythmically to compressed stress in "shutter...ignited in perfect synchronization."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to peak sync; minor opening metaphor density ("shroud," "cathedral") purposeful for hush, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chemical timer and etched grain transform space-age mining trope into fresh testimony CR, risking quiet photo-ending that heightens remembrance stakes organically.</comment>
