<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marco's polished calm is embodied through steady pulse and perceptive listening during the reunion, earning the father's choice; contradictory impulses surface in father's road temptation vs. new path. Father's traits emerge distinctly via bill stories without stereotypes. Minor summary in backstory slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid Accumulative/Situational lens holds: texture of bills/markers accumulates to situational crystallization in father's "Show me your markers" with felt cost in Marco's loosening knot. Orientation anchored early in train home. Single scene with BRR-compliant reflection tightens to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Circus train and bills constrain sanctuary choice and charge final platform image; sensors mirror internal markers. Sensory details like mist and dusk filter through Marco's perceptive bias, evolving with dusk. No white-room; tactile lived-in use throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking path cycles—signals early via bills, tightens through revelations narrowing father's options to stay/learn markers. Agency in Marco's dissuasion forces father's stance with relational cost legible in hand on railing. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of breakable circles emerges from bills as past markers vs. present sensors, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Father's regret (Icelandic króna) adds complexity; resonant non-literal answer in loosening knot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean third-limited POV with perceptual signature in calm observations; dialogue subtextual ("You're trying to dissuade me") pursues goals distinctly. Rhythm modulates with dusk deepening; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts—e.g., "dusky harmony" purposeful recurrence. Propulsion builds to charged final line; precise diction like "territorial markers" integrates action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber bills as dual markers (past trophies, future map) transforms tropes organically; risk in quiet poise ending heightens stakes. Irreplaceable train sanctuary inflects reunion uniquely.</comment>
