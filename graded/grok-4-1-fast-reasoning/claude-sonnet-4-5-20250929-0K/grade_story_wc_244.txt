<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in her jocular laugh deflecting emotion and talking to the rock, revealing contradictory impulses of competence masking loneliness; group mirrors this effectively without dilution. Final choice to build a network earns change via prior isolation. Secondary characters like Emil apply pressure through shared fragments, but brief sketches limit deeper status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor arrivals build density/pattern to fragments combining, yielding CR closure in "This is when the story changes"—reconfiguring impermanence into permanent connection with felt cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early in station; one tightening via gatherings suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-shrouded station as micro-setting constrains via "abandoned places where infrastructure failed but nature persists," mirroring internal states and guiding gathering choice; sensory details (moss-covered benches, dim light pulsing) selective through Mara's priorities. Recurrent ivy evolves to anchor network. For 9+ gate, setting charges final image of permanence amid decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of loneliness signaled early, escalates accumulatively via arrivals and rock combination narrowing isolation options; agency in choosing to "stay found" with relational cost legible in permitting need. One deepening at fragments' shift forces stance crystallization. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity emerges organically from rumor chains and rock gifts, culminating in non-literal CR answer—"permission to stop moving"—reweighting prior aid networks without moralizing; ambiguity in sender invites reflection. Final image of laughing genuinely charges theme. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person close to Mara with perceptual bias (professional mask, rock as confidant); dialogue natural/subtextual (Emil's "wild gleam," Mara's tightening chest). Voice distinct in rhythm/syntax reflecting jocular deflection. Clean distance, no head-hopping despite group.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines like "rumor made flesh" advancing character/atmosphere; rhythm varies (short punchy realizations vs. flowing descriptions), no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation in "practiced anarchy" fits voice without drift. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moon rocks as reciprocity catalyst transforms disaster-relief trope into fresh network origin; rumor chains offer non-obvious angle on connection. Risky multi-arrival mosaic taught early heightens stakes coherently. Inevitable synthesis in "cured of loneliness... by choosing... to stay found."</comment>
