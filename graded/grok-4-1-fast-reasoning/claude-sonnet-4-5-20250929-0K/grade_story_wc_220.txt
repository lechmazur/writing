<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calder's resignation yields to purpose via embodied tears and forehead-to-forehead bond with Mercy, earning the final choice; Mercy's nose twitch reveals contradictory retirement impulse acting in scene. Internal conflict layers without therapy-speak. Minor telling in "intuitively descriptive" label doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density builds to cylinder decode, pattern break in settlement hush-to-steps reconfigures isolation with felt cost of risked connection. Orientation anchors by para 2 (scrapyard, post-wars). Closure CR lands cleanly in final image of "grooves worn into earth," reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard's "iron cancer" and evolving "wild hush" to "hundreds of feet" subtly constrain isolation, mirroring internal shift; leaf as micro-setting charges final clip-to-pack image. Sensory hierarchy (Mercy's nose, wind) biases purposefully. No white-room; choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distance as isolation) signaled early, deepens via decode tightening options to shared maps; agency in sketching/sharing forecloses solitude with legible cost in wept resignation. Lens escalation via cadence shift suffices; minor abstractness in stakes doesn't dull peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (grooves/maps/silences) to final non-literal answer: "closeness was never about proximity, but about choosing"; leaf reprise reweights without moralizing. Complexity in fear-as-measurement lingers authentically. No thematic echo in Calder's lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mercy's scent bias and Calder's groove-reading; rhythm modulates from hush to steps without head-hopping. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("We were trackers once"). Voice compression purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with no loops/paraphrase; rhythm varies (short dawn sketches to long final image), propulsion ties to emotional beats. Figurative "iron cancer" coherent/pattern-taught. Zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious groove-encoding transforms post-apoc trope via cylinder riddles/maps; leaf synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric hush-to-movement payoff. Bold voice commits without retreat; fresh on familiar wasteland.</comment>
