<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in coaxing blooms and measuring the gauge tooth's weight; contradictory impulses surface in tending dying plants despite endings. Final realization earned by prior tending beats, with felt cost of loss foreclosed into endurance. Mrs. Chen's line applies relational pressure without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of garden-tending shards builds pattern of light/growth to CR closure in final image of gauge beside rosebush, reweighting legacy with conceptual cost of measured vulnerability. Orientation anchored early (rosebush, fire escape, harbor). Neighbor's plot provides one tightening reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and mirror system constrain choices, channeling light into dark corners via tactical adjustments. Sensory details (papery petals, oars' rhythm) filter through Mira's priorities. Rosebush and gauge charge final image as micro-settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coaxing growth/light) signaled early, accumulates via garden circuits to deepening realization; neighbor's plot tightens as external validation forcing stance crystallization. Cost legible in bare rosebush endured for renewal certainty under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unlocking growth via angles emerges organically from mirrors/plants/legacy; final gauge-measuring reconfigures without moralizing, reweighting "protection" as vulnerable care. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in renewal lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in light/shadow noticing; rhythmic prose modulates wistfully from tending to charged poise. Mrs. Chen's dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short petals sentence to flowing harbor); purposeful repetition of harbor builds texture without loops. Final line's image propels cleanly, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmithing/gardening via light-measuring transforms urban decay trope; mirrors system risks bold ingenuity heightening stakes. Inevitable hindsight from particulars like gauge behind brick.</comment>
