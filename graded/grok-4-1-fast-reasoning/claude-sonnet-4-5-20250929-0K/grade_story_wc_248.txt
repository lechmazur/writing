<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's promise, embodied in trembling hands and tears during cave discovery; contradictory analytical/intuitive impulses act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Interiority particular via specific thefts like self-portrait; flaws (criminality) complicate choices with real cost to reputation. Micro-choices like photographing align with values, earning final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifact density builds from portrait backstory to tapestry match in cave, culminating in CR closure as she emerges with proof pressed to heart, reweighting history with burned-life cost legible in "ready to face whatever judgment." Orientation anchors early (cave frescoes, six months off-grid). Single scene with reflective shards fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cave limestone system and frescoes vividly constrain via tactile tracing and pigment vibrancy, mirroring internal states; tapestry matching charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (ochre touch, faded threads) reflects analytical POV bias. No white-room; spatial coherence in wall-to-pack placement guides discovery choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise via art trail) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to tapestry revelation and three-day documentation, narrowing to emergence trade-off with judgment cost. Agency in thefts and photographing forecloses safe academic life; moral calculus (destroy to preserve) sharpens peak tears moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transcending love emerges organically from censored art particulars (torn tapestry, scratched portrait) to cave match, reweighting censorship's rule-set in final "acts of destruction were really acts of love" image without statement. Resonance from grandmother grip callback; ambiguity in institutional judgment lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable, perceptual signature blends analytical precision ("methodical precision") with intuitive ("heart understood"); rhythmic modulation peaks in volcanic tenderness phrasing under emotional stress. No head-hopping; diction controlled, biased to art history lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., fresco tracing advances setting/character); rhythm varies, propulsion fits reflective builds to emergence. Minor overwrite in "volcanic tenderness erupting" metaphor near tears but no muddle or loops touching closure; clean grammar, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-thief quest tracing suppressed loves to ancient archive transforms vandalism trope via surgical thefts and promise motif; risk in equating destruction-with-love charges ending organically. No derivative echoes; particulars like Tethyan/Tapestry chain inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
