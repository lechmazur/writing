<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potter's zen-like interiority shines in embodied recognition of thrumming as pottery wheel moment; micro-choices like picking up glass and meditating reveal values under pressure. Beekeeper applies secondary pressure via explanation that stabilizes his form. Final endurance of gentle shaping earned by prior causality, with world-burning cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to visions/dialogue to harmonizing timelines. Orientation anchored early (dusk, oasis, sun patterns). CR closure via aligned timelines reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of forgotten kindness; glass departure crystallizes before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (thrum, suspended dust, bent light) filtered through potter's tactile bias mirrors internal states. Recurring glass constrains vision/choice and charges final image. Wasteland/oasis contrast pressures quest without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand resistance) signaled early, tightens texturally via glass visions and beekeeper dialogue narrowing to kindness realization. Agency in meditation/uptake forecloses hardness path; cost felt in "world outside burns" and bone-thrumming reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kindness as phototropic accumulation emerges organically from visions/honey metaphor, not statement; final image reweights acts across time without moralizing. Beekeeper's "sharp gentleness" line borders direct but integrates via stabilizing form.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with pottery-inflected perceptual signature (clay cracks, wheel thrum); diction/rhythm modulates poetically under revelation. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You already know"); distinct voices via idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "timelines fractured and overlapped like cracks in twice-fired clay"); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, no loops/artifacts. Purposeful "thrum" recurrence taught early, pays off in bone harmony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timelines anchored by kindness/phototropism transforms post-apocalyptic trope via potter/beekeeper lens; risk in temporal overlap heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from sun patterns to final shimmer.</comment>
