<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's luminous regret from her sister's loss embodies contradictory impulses in the coin repair and delivery, earning the closure choice with visible emotional cost. Magistrate's hollow-eyed reaction applies secondary pressure, revealing her balanced traits under grief's weight. Interiority concrete in "stomach clench with luminous regret."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from coin discovery to repair to delivery, landing Charged Poise closure in magistrate's tears and candle—cost legible in "seventeen years of terrible, suspended hope." Orientation anchored early in foundry post-storm. One tightening via name-speaking ritual suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry's steaming puddles, bellows firelight, and pattering rain constrain alchemical choices and charge final walk back to fires. Coin/tongs as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward alchemical urgency; recurs in rain-washed streets mirroring grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem absence via coin) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through gold flow and name incantation narrowing to truth's delivery. Agency in Mara's ritual forecloses futile hope with magistrate's tears as felt cost. Coherent pressure under lens forces acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief's kintsugi emerges implicitly from repair process and "fracture becomes part of the beauty," reweighting names' absence in candle's memorial shift. No moralizing; final image offers non-literal resonance without binaries. Complexity in "redeemed nothing" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature alchemically biased ("metal sang," "gold began to flow"). Dialogue sparse, subtextual in "Everything breaks," advancing closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, diction purposeful without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action lines; varied rhythm in "The metal sang as she worked... funeral bell." No loops/artifacts; "luminous regret" repetition voice-motivated. Propulsion peaks clean in coin's "gentle warmth" and candle image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-alchemy-names mysticism transforms grief tropes organically, risking "factually mystical" premise into earned CR closure. Irreplaceable coin seam charges memorial; no derivative hedging, bold emotional specificity throughout.</comment>
