<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Siblings' relationship crucible forces Kael's shift from curse to messenger, earned via Mira's compass reveal and dialogue; interiority concrete through tastes, but early "luminous skeptic" label borders diagnostic without full embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of tastes/compass spins tightening to Charged Poise closure; needle settling on Kael delivers on-page CR with conceptual cost of reweighting inheritance as planetary election.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora/lavender bluff constrains choices via electromagnetic tie to compass, charging final valley-point image; tastes filter POV sensory hierarchy purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weather-carriers' purpose) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to revelation narrowing curse/path options; Kael's dissipating clouds make cost legible without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of converging democracies reconfigures premise non-literally, emerging from tastes/compass without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "elected" messengers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tastes; dialogue natural/subtextual ("useless thing") advances goal, voices distinct without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion via taste motifs; minor overwriting in aurora pulses but no loops/artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting weather/planetary elections transforms tropes; compass reprise risks bold terrestrially cosmic frame, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
