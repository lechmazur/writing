<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "cheerful gloom" embodied throughout; final transliteration earns realization with cost of pruned paths. Interiority concrete and particular to foam collector. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under time pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions builds to CR closure in "some paths disappear... so we can bear the weight," with conceptual cost of infinite possibilities pruned. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via drops suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iridescent light and crystalline walls mirror internal "cheerful gloom," constraining via tide deadline; final pulse charges image. Sensory selection POV-biased to emotions in light/foam. Coherent choreography in single cave scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via drops revealing unmade realities, forcing realization trade-off. Tide rumble makes time cost legible, charging poise. Agency in drops/transliteration; no coincidences resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of merciful pruning emerges via visions, resonant in final "cheerful gloom like a blessing" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in albatross seeds; ambiguity lingers in unmade archive. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature tying notice to foam/emotions; rhythmic lyricism modulates with discoveries. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No POV slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration; no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "erupted in sensation" purposeful, not muddled in peaks. Minor overwriting in light descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory/quantum pruning via foam and geode; albatross seeds transform discovery trope organically. Risky conceptual fantasy logic commits fully, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
