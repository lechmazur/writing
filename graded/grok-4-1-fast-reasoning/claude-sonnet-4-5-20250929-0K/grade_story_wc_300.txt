<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's shift from clinical detachment to emotional purpose is earned through embodied reactions like breath catching and trembling hands during the shell reading, revealing contradictory impulses of professional skepticism versus intuitive sensing. Final renunciation of detachment feels motivated by artifact discoveries. No unearned epiphanies; interiority particular to an inspector's lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discoveries build density toward CR closure: Marcus's new purpose reconfigures his profession with felt cost in "the weight of his profession differently now." Orientation anchored immediately in caves/inspector role. Pearl warming and caves pulsing provide persistent constraint shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain via shrine alcove discovery and charge closure as facets pulse/brighten with Marcus's realization, mirroring internal shift. Sensory details (heartbeat echoing, facets multiplying light) selective through inspector's priorities. Final brightening evolves causally from pearl's glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of detached inspection deepens accumulatively via shell confessions and artifact radiance, narrowing options from inventory to testimony with visible cost in rethinking isolation's human toll. Agency in gathering artifacts forces trade-off against old clinical role. One tightening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope needing connection emerges organically from shell's "hope doesn't survive in vaults" and artifact gathering, answered non-literally in caves' living radiance. Final image reweights bunker trope without moralizing. Complexity in preservation's failure lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with inspector's perceptual signature (ventilation/clinical lens yielding to radiance). Prose texture lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences in "breath caught" beat). No head-hopping; diction fits pragmatic character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences multilayered (e.g., "facets beginning to pulse... as if the entire chamber breathed"). Varied rhythm propels without loops; no artifacts dull closure's "radiance no longer latent, but alive." Figuratives purposeful, not overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bunker as mausoleum of hopes transforms doomsday trope via pearl/shell confessions and radiance awakening. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Particular artifacts ensure non-obvious inevitability.</comment>
