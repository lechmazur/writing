<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Borrowed personalities drive micro-choices like adopting mathematician's wonder to map grief-joy resonances, earning final insight; self-dissolution cost visible in blurred heartbeat, balancing competence with struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as emotional data density tightens via halo pressing to CR closure ("emotions weren't separate variables"), reweighting with conceptual cost of vanishing stars and self-loss on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Topaz walls pulsing to moods and halo warmth constrain choices in workshop, charging final glowing impression; selective sensory integration mirrors internal dissolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to map emotion math deepens via halo alignment, narrowing to unified force realization; agency in persistent pressing forecloses self-identity path, felt in "could no longer tell where she ended."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final equations ("Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance") offer resonant non-literal answer to emotion unity, reweighting borrowed-self dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in "emotional residue—crystallized feelings"; rhythmic modulation accelerates insight beats, dialogue sparse but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in lines like "joy sharp as broken glass, love that tasted of copper and rain"; varied rhythm propels without loops or muddled metaphors at peak alignment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Letterpress empathy math in contracting universe synthesizes fresh angle on dissolution; halo equations inevitable from prior patterns, bold without gimmickry.</comment>
