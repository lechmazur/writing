<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia paradox roots motivation and compels portrait method with embodied contradiction; micro-choices like methodical setup reveal values under case pressure; minor diagnostic label-speak early slightly abstracts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through interviews and drawing to CR closure in Morrison's visit and ribbon touch; cost legible in "shadowed quarry of her mind"; orientation anchored early at quarry edge, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry mist and shadows constrain drawing solitude and mirror internal dormancy, charging final image; ribbon as recurring micro-object enables portrait; sensory selection (charcoal whisper, limestone) purposeful via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy) signaled early, accumulates via portrait to witness revival tightening; agency in unifying opposites forecloses facial literalism with felt cost in her limits; minor abstractness in stakes pre-quarry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empathy-over-features theme emerges organically from particulars like ambiguous portrait and laughter description; final realization reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; resonance in ribbon reprise avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature blurring faces while sharpening emotional architecture; rhythmic modulation in hush phrases and drawing hush; sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven in Morrison's line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (short charcoal whispers amid lyrical builds); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (mist like memory); rhythm peaks in press hush echo charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia artist painting "empathy itself" transforms cold-case trope via paradoxical method; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk in non-literal portrait heightens stakes organically.</comment>
