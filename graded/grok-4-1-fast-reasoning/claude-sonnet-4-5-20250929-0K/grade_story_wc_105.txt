<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in trembling-fingered decision to destroy vs. build device, earned by obsession's embodied arc; tears freezing on cheeks ground emotional cost without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to hearing "gray...fraying one strand," culminating in on-page crystal drop as CR/DC with release-cost legible in "memory became something else entirely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen forge and aurora constrain imprint/release choices, with fading "pale green" charging final image; tactile greenhouse (roots in salt-water, rusted chains) mirrors internal fraying without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (capture trust-break sound) deepens unbearably upon hearing it, forcing agency in crystal drop; trade-off forecloses preservation path under Accumulative lens with emotional cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Absence-collection particulars yield resonant CR: "listened to the absence, and found it was not empty," reweighting preservation premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("burgundy crackle of oxidizing copper," "gray...diminishing note") biases sensory hierarchy consistently to closure under stable third-person limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm to peak "structural failure...one strand at a time"; coherent metaphors avoid muddle, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic "sound of trust breaking" as fraying gray cable synthesizes speculative science and grief riskily yet inevitably, transforming memory trope through cellular absences.</comment>
