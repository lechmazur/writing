<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (reluctance vs. resolve) act simultaneously in the spice-crushing beat, earning the final human-surrender choice with embodied cost; Tam's warnings deepen relational crucible without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup to RR closure (touch/hand-holding) with legible cost ("no longer entirely human"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spices (cinnamon that burns cold) constrain the conjure choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (scent drives blur) reflects Mira's priorities, evolving causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (reforge bond) signaled early tightens via Tam's warning and agency in crushing spices, foreclosing humanity with on-page cost; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (thresholds crossed via fear) emerges organically from metamorphosis particulars, resonating in final image ("hold her brother's hand again") without moralizing; fortune reprises reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (fractured animal languages, moon-pulse heart); dialogue subtextual (Tam's warning pursues evasion), distinct voices under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (lines multitask sensory/character advance); rhythm varies with transformation acceleration, zero loops/artifacts; figurative control (constellation fur) purpose-driven, no muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-bond fantasy via spice-metamorphosis logic; risk-taking in cosmic tone heightens stakes, transforming tropes organically without hedging.</comment>
