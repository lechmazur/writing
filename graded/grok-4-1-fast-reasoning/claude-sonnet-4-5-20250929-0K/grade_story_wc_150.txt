<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like descending with shears and lamp; final renunciation of exile earned via causal buildup of tomb-clearing acts, though "The work changed her" borders on unearned summary epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from wandering to descent to placement; Charged Poise closure in sundial shadow and "She would stay" reconfigures interrupted journey with felt cost of foreclosed abroad life, legible in final blossom image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard setting with roots coiling skulls constrains excavation choices and charges closure shadow; selective sensory details like dirt cascading from sundial integrate via goal-directed action, mirroring internal restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unnamed seeking tightens accumulatively to faith restoration via descent and clearing; agency in placing sundial forecloses return with visible time cost ("six weeks ago"), charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of restoration from grief emerges organically through orchard-tomb bridge; final blossom offering resonates as non-literal answer to interrupted journeys without moralizing, reweighting premise via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in half-remembered prayers and root-finger imagery; rhythmic modulation builds enchantment under pressure, no dialogue to judge but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and strong verbs drives propulsion; minor paraphrase loop in "weeks wandering...six weeks ago" but no closure harm, purposeful specificity replaces generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb-orchard synthesis transforms diaspora trope via grounded excavation; risk in nonlinear time handled coherently, though restoration arc echoes familiar homecoming without bold subversion.</comment>
