<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to evolve her grandfather's legacy compels micro-choices like journal coding and dance syntax, rooted in lyrical traits. Interiority embodied in calm underwater work reveals vulnerability-strength tension. Minimal on-page contradiction limits to very strong; final renunciation of overt action earns stasis with regime risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from descent to innovations, holding to CR closure in ascent and "seventeen prisoners would walk free," reweighting codes as cage keys with ongoing exposure cost. Orientation anchored early in lab descent. One tightening via dance method suffices; minor ellipsis motivation caps below 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains via wetsuit/journal adaptations and charges final "laboratory exhaled" image. Sensory details (bioluminescent algae, tidal hum) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring preservation theme. Vivid yet purposeful; 9+ test met but Q2 caps at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resistance coding signaled early, deepens via dance/journal to breakout plan, narrowing to poised defiance under Accumulative lens. Agency in encrypting findings forecloses safe inaction with regime interception risk. Cost legible in "swim through networks"; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges via journal fears-to-cries and dance syntax, resonating in final "keys that opened every cage" without statement. Subtext in spider web patience vs. regime opacity. Complexity in personal-political weave; no final moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in "encryption as poetry" and rhythmic syntax matching code-breaker mind. Compression purposeful in descent-ascent frame. No head-hopping; 9+ test met but Q2 caps at 8.8.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short urgent entries amid lyrical swells), high density in multi-job lines like journal-as-memoir cipher. Minor figurative density ("amber freezing time," "light through ocean") purposeful, not muddling peaks. No loops; propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater cryptography, dance code, dice keys transforms resistance tropes organically. Dice and dance inflections grow from legacy particulars. Risk in lyric defiance heightens stakes; 9+ test met but Q2 caps at 8.8.</comment>
