<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collective town/residents lack deep interiority or contradictory impulses; tuner shown consistently cryptic but no embodied flaws or micro-choices under pressure complicate her path. Sparse dialogue reveals traits without status dynamics or value hierarchy. Final collective endurance feels observational rather than earned by prior individual causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: walking rhythms build density to cadence shift at bell's sealing ("crack...sealed itself"). Orientation anchored early (archway arrival). Closure as RR (Charged Poise) with cost (ongoing footsteps post-departure) legible in final image; one tightening via people joining suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobblestones and empty buildings constrain walking pattern and charge final resonance; archway bookends evolution from hush to hum. Sensory hierarchy (rhythm, hums over visuals) reflects tuner's priorities. Details integrate via action, mirroring shift from abandonment to anticipation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore hope's frequency) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern break (people join) narrowing to tower climb. Agency in tuner's patient rhythms forces town stance crystallization. Cost felt in "infinitely slowly" maintenance post-repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resonance/balance emerges via particulars (footsteps, fork hums) reweighting ghost town premise. Final image ("footsteps continued") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in riddles ("frequency of hope") avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person with perceptual signature tuned to silence/rhythm; voice modulates poetically without drift. Sparse dialogue cryptic/natural, advances via riddle exchanges. Rhythmic syntax mirrors theme without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in climax); no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful ("ice melting") enhance without muddle. Propulsion peaks at "note...rose from the cobblestones."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tuning fork/footsteps revive town via resonance, transforming ghost town trope organically. Risk in cryptic method pays off at bell repair; no derivative echoes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
