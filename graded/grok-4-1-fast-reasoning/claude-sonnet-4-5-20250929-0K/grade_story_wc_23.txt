<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in sternum pull versus building hands; final forward purpose renunciation earned by family losses and device realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure; bronze patina rotation and dawn hum reconfigure migration as temporal well with sternum-cost resistance legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dead station's salvaged gyroscopes constrain building choice; jacket charts and sternum pull charge final navigation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding pull tightens via phone revelation and device spin; agency in wiring forecloses migration with felt bone-tug cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final realization reweights migration premise as memory gravity without stating moral; raw solace answers navigation question through charged poise image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct navigational perceptual signature in chart-tracing and patina-reading; cryptic dialogue subtext advances stakes cleanly under stable limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in building sequence; varied rhythm and zero loops heighten dawn closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reverse migration to temporal density synthesizes fresh conceptual risk; patina-calendar turn inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
