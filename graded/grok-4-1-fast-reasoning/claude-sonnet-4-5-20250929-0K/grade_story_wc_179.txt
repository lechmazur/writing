<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's scheming patience and Kale's fury-to-release arc show contradictory impulses acting in scene, with Kale's final reach earning closure via prior cellular revelations. Music box handling reveals Mira's worldview under pressure. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses resentment path with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via reality shifts to RR closure (pin materializes from letting go), reconfiguring resentment with felt cellular cost in final beat. Single scene, orientation anchored early. One tightening via inherited memory deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of Sanctuary and cellular memory constrain interactions (light words, mind-melody); music box charges final image by materializing pin. Sensory selection (silent vibrations, inherited cells) purposeful and embodied. Details evolve causally with shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release resentment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through memory visions narrowing Kale's narrative. Kale's reach crystallizes stance with legible cost (inherited pain foreclosed). Agency in micro-choices under Mira's pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resentment as inherited/incompletable emerges organically via music box shifts; final complete song reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in gaps/silences charges closure. Complexity lingers in generational pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cellular harmony pre-ears); rhythmic control modulates with shifts. Written-light "dialogue" natural/subtextual, advances via accusation-response. No head-hopping; diction biased to Mira's grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (gap in song) integrate without muddle in peaks. No loops/scaffold; propulsion via image-action (e.g., "pin materialized"). Minor poetic elevation fits voice, no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cellular memory + resentment-void collapses facility, transforming pacifism tropes via music box evolution. Risky soundless mental space heightens ingenuity; inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious moral calculus on inheritance.</comment>
