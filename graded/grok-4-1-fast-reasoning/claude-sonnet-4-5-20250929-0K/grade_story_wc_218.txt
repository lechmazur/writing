<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's brazen calm and systematic trait root clear motivation, embodied in weakening body yet precise final entry; interiority concrete via orchard observations, with earned change in participatory death. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits exceptionalism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diary discovery to orchard transformations, culminating in CR/Charged Poise closure where Maren's breath integrates into collaborative dialogue, with legible cost in her final weakness and diary placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like pulsing pillars and copper-veined branches constrain remodel choices and charge final breathing orchard image; POV-filtered through caretaker's priorities, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (final remodel for interspecies network) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via observed changes (birds, fox, fungi lines) forcing deepened commitment; agency in systematic work yields visible cost in her physical decline charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of respect as collaborative architecture emerges organically from particulars like wired branches and diary quotes, resonating in final image of unified breathing without moralizing; reweights premise via Maren's participatory death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (systematic noticing of ecosystem shifts); lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, compression purposeful for accumulative texture, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through changes; minor repetitive "systematic" phrasing purposeful for voice, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of diary and breathing orchard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mycorrhizal networks, copper wiring, and temple as translation device transforms ecological tropes into bold interspecies architecture; risk in quiet death closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
