<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to guide via prophecy intensifies into doubt and earned transformation, with contradictory impulses (routine vs. tremor of doubt) acting in the Singing Chamber approach. Final renunciation of knowing feels compelled by prior cave shifts. Minor slip: embodied emotions lean poetic over raw contradiction in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cave patterns build to break at pearl's void and explosion, delivering CR closure where Mara's unread future burns bright with conceptual cost of stolen wonders. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity. Cost legible in "every prophecy she'd delivered had prevented... authentic surprise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Musical cave and shadows constrain perception and choices throughout, mirroring internal shift; bioluminescent moss and prismatic light filter via Mara's bias. Evolves causally to charge final image. Recurrent shadows as doors reweight premise indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prophecy as magnification vs. preserving mystery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discordant ripples and pearl void forcing stance crystallization. Pilgrim's reveal narrows options; agency in Mara's "Teach me" forecloses oracle path with felt cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of revelation's cost emerges via particulars like stolen futures in pearl droplets; final image reweights premise non-literally as "world she finally couldn't read... beautiful." No moralizing; resonant ambiguity lingers in transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("frequencies Mara could taste"); voice modulates rhythmically under rising doubt. Dialogue subtextual and distinct—pilgrim's shift from unpredictable to steady reveals without exposition. Clean free indirect under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via sensory propulsion; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("shadows grew teeth") purposeful for tone, not muddling peak pearl beat. Rhythmic control peaks in "cave sang her into something new."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope via cave-as-prophet critique and "bright darkness" synthesis; unseen forces' reprisal feels inevitable from early shadow glitches. Bold textural risk heightens mystery stakes organically.</comment>
