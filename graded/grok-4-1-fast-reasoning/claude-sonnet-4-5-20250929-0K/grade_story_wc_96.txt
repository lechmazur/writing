<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied internal conflict in molting personalities shown via borrowed smiles and angular thoughts; friendship crucible forces expansion from library to everywhere. Final planting choice earned by September's clarity amid forgetting cost. Minor backstory exceeds brief fragments but anchors present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sorting to seeds to planting under moonlight. Orientation anchored early (rusted prison library, full moon). Closure as Charged Poise/CR in poem and realization, cost legible in "forgetting was part of the work" with conceptual price of molting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Desert library's peeled roof and dust corners constrain digging, charge final silver moonlight image. Sensory hierarchy reflects poet's priorities (stars through holes mirror mind). Setting evolves with moon climb, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty from anarchy) signaled early, deepens via seed find and "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" narrowing to resistance. Agency in planting forecloses inaction; cost in dust toil and impending forgetting felt on page. Accumulative escalation coherent without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: ruins, molting, seeds into "ruins bloom brightest when tended by broken hands." Final poem image reweights premise non-literally, embracing forgetting cost without moralizing. Subtext in laughter amid chaos lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (luminous, fractured imagery). Dialogue natural/subtextual: Kai's practical laugh vs. her improvised poem advances bond. Rhythm modulates from quiet sorting to heightened moonlight planting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "moonlight spilling like liquid silver"). Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors consistent (snake skin, sardine can). Minor overwriting in reflective phrases but propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: molting poet planting "blooming resistance" in prison ruins transforms tropes organically. Risky tone of luminous chaos inevitable in hindsight; final poem turn grows from particulars without gimmick.</comment>
