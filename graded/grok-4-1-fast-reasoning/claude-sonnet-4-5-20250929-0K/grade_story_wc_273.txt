<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's serene anger embodied in coiled readiness versus pausing for ink patterns reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final capture earned by prior causal tracking with felt cost of deepened understanding. Vera applies pressure via dialogue but remains somewhat expository. Childhood backstory anchors present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: clues therefore cave confrontation; Charged Poise closure in "let the ink patterns finish forming first" with legible cost of delayed justice in stretched seconds. Orientation anchored early via encampment post-eclipse. Single scene, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wind-carved sand and evaporating ink constrain tracking choices throughout; cave equipment/ink circles charge final image of eternity touch. Sensory hierarchy via Kael's landscape-reading bias selective and vivid. No white-room; evolves causally with pursuit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture killer) signaled early, tightens via ignored drone to cave dialogue forcing stance; agency in halting drone forecloses violence option with moral cost. Pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise. One reversal sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time-slowing theme emerges organically from ink trails and cave realization, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; Vera's question elicits resonant CR on hyperawareness cost. Subtext in shared "crisis consciousness" lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "read landscape itself"; voice modulates rhythmically under stress. Dialogue natural/subtextual, advances stakes; minor register elevation in Vera's speech but distinct from Kael.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel pursuit; purposeful repetition of "ink" builds texture without loops. Minor overwrite in "serene anger... undisturbed as desert air" but doesn't obscure closure. Clean mechanics, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal research, ephemeral ink maps transform pursuit trope; consciously wild tracking via patterns feels inevitable. Bold risk in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
