<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassius's boredom and Naia's resentment drive contradictory impulses, with her final step into the gap earning his unfamiliar fear through prior relational pressure. Final realization—"he finally understood what he'd lost"—shows earned change with relational cost. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown via choices like letting her go.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fragment causes mutiny, Naia's plan tightens via storm peak, leading to on-page CR where Cassius glimpses beyond and reconfigures his boredom into pursuit. Closure cost legible in "the prismatic escondite stood empty" and his plotting. Single scene, orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prismatic walls fragment shadows, magnetic fields writhe and dance visibly, constraining perception and enabling Naia's gap—charges final image of unraveling threads. Sensory hierarchy via Cassius's dimensional awareness narrows to storm's geometries. Details evolve causally with mutiny.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Naia's escape via fragment/mutiny) signaled early, tightens causally through revelation and storm crescendo, forcing Cassius's renunciation with felt relational cost in her tears and his whisper. Agency in her pressing fragment to chest; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of immortality's void vs. finality emerges via fragment's pulse and Naia's "some goodbyes are meant to be final," reweighted in Cassius's loss-glimpse and renewed plotting—non-literal answer with ambiguity of beyond. Resonance from particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV via Cassius's dimensional sight ("impossible geometries that hurt to perceive"); voice perceptual signature in writhing fields/serpents. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Naia's accusation forces admission). Rhythmic control modulates to peak unraveling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "pulsing with a rhythm that shouldn't exist" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (auroras as "impossible geometries"). Propulsion peaks in "dimensions tore, and she stepped into the gap."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms dimensional tropes via fragment's bleed, with fresh CR in Cassius glimpsing "something else entirely" before plotting pursuit—inevitable synthesis. Bold risk in quiet sci-fantasy farewell charging immortal chase.</comment>
