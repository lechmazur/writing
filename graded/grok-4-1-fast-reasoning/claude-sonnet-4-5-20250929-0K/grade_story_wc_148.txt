<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Matthias's motivation rooted in cry-wolf legacy drives intensifying choices, culminating in earned step into light foreclosing outside world; contradictory impulses (liar lineage vs. truth) act in scene via lattice handling and final hover. Prisoners apply targeted pressure without diluting POV. Minor expository tint in their lines doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lattice fit opens impossible passage, density of revelations tightens to CR closure where Matthias hovers, reweighting legacy with abandonment cost legible in "felt himself begin to hover" against approaching boots. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single-shard progression coherent. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Copper light recurs as micro-setting constraining perception and charging final image, guiding choices through chapel lattice and impossible rooms; sensory details (rust/regret smell, molten ocean) selective via POV urgency. Reef's thin reality enables transformation payoff. Jagged coherence throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validate father's truth) signaled early, accumulates via prisoner reveal and time pressure (boots), forcing agency in step into light with foreclosed normalcy cost. One tightening suffices under lens; moral calculus of legacy vs. sustenance sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth sustaining impossibilities emerges via lattice words shifting meaning at hover; final image non-literally reanswers cry-wolf premise without moralizing, reweighting particulars like "thread the labyrinth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (copper light as "liquid truth"); voice rhythmic, modulates to charged compression at "felt himself begin to hover." Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (oldest prisoner's question pursues recruitment).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax accelerates through passages, breathes in revelations; no loops, purposeful figuratives (copperlight "gilded the morning sea") cohere without muddle. Final line recharges motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf trope via reality-thin reef and story-threading transformation feels inevitable; risk in impossible geometry heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
