<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (love/resentment for father) act simultaneously in reflections anchored to symbols and bracelet; final choice to visit earned by revelation without tidy resolution. Flaws complicate without hedging; embodied in narrowed vision widening via lantern moment. Voice coherent and particular to professor's probabilistic lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from subway notes to koan to mica revelation, culminating in CR closure ("question mark dissolving into possibility") with persistent melancholy cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored immediately (library, rain, bracelet). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain drumming on skylight, mica's "amber distortion" constrain choices (power outage prompts lantern use, distortion reveals negative space). Sensory hierarchy probabilistic/obsessive (symbols "shift and breathe"). Final rain cessation charges image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcilement via widened view) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through symbol interpretation tightening to agency in hospital decision; cost felt in "melancholy remained... fertile ground." One deepening (lantern reveal) forecloses narrowed probability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges implicitly from symbols as questions ("How do you mourn someone still alive?"), reweighted non-literally in final sunlight/clover image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (probabilistic metaphors like "spin of the wheel") stable, modulates with intensity; rhythmic control in reflective beats. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "lucid contradictions weren't lost on her" layers character/theme/action); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (mica "warped lens"), no muddle in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subway scrawls as timeless conversation decoded via probability lens transforms reconciliation trope. Symbols' negative space ("WIDEN YOUR VIEW") inevitable in hindsight; risk in cryptic method heightens stakes organically.</comment>
