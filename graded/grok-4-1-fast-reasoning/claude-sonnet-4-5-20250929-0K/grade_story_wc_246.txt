<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in embodied anxiety with the pen as worry stone and inner-ear tug from anomaly; micro-choices like unbending the nib reveal contradictory impulses toward order vs. chaos. Final filling/writing earns her arc through prior causality, foreclosing rigid certainty with felt cost. Minor slip: emotional progression slightly tidy without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from signal filtering to record alterations to history-as-palimpsest realization. Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page as Mara fills pen and writes signals, reweighting premise with cost of released certainty ("unbending too"). Orientation anchored early (Kepler Station tower by para 1); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Anomaly as setting pressures perception ("sideways tug... spacetime hiccupping") and charges final image via station as "margin between drafts." Pen functions as micro-setting, handled tactilely to constrain choices and mirror internal shift. Sensory details selective/POV-biased (celestial whispers, nib curve).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning from signals) deepens accumulatively: timestamps precede catalogs → records alter → noise as edits, narrowing to acceptance with agency in cataloging/writing. One tightening forecloses prior filtering certainty; cost legible in "releasing the rigid certainty." Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-in-chaos emerges organically from signal edits, pen unbending paralleling self, history's "palimpsest"; final image ("stars blinked... depending on which draft") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Subtext in paradox lingers via ambiguity (old/new history). No thematic echo or sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: signals as "whispers and stutters," history "flex[ing] like a poem." Rhythmic diction modulates uncertainty (lyric compression in realizations); prose mirrors mind under anomaly pressure. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent ("bookmark... margin between drafts") and purposeful, no muddle in peak realizations. Varied rhythm, zero loops/paraphrase (e.g., no synonym churn in signal beats); read-aloud cadence breathes with epiphany build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: anomaly as revision-concentrate, signals editing via gravity-links transforms sci-fi tropes; pen-straightening mirrors unbending acceptance risks bold conceptual commitment. Inevitable hindsight from particulars; no derivative hedging.</comment>
