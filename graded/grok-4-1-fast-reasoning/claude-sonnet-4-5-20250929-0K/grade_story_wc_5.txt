<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Physical demonstration of patience through deliberate gestures roots motivation deeply, with micro-choices like pressing plate to chest revealing values; interiority concrete and embodied, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses or flaw confrontation to fully earn stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern-building density crescendos to aurora recording and map revelation; closure as Charged Poise in sealing with "whispered promise" lands on-page with conceptual cost of preserved longing, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost-silvered trees and crater floor constrain patient arrangement of discarded items; recurring copper plate and flash-paper charge final sealing image, sensory details (breath crystallizing) filtered through alchemical patience without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping orchard persistence tightens via aurora-sync heartbeat recording, narrowing to dawn revelation; patient endurance forecloses rushed alternatives with felt time/cold cost, coherent under Accumulative lens but escalation subtle without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of permission over force emerges organically from rot-to-map transformation, final orchard-sealing image reweighting dying persistence without moralizing; resonance from particulars like root-dreams avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature of meditative slowness in syntax/rhythm; diction like "photons that traveled eons" purposeful and biased, modulating to sacred stillness without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "translucent skin over bone" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, minor figurative density in peak recording beat but coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, starlight, and bio-electrical mapping transforms persistence tropes; risk of lyric patience amid decay heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via logbook seed.</comment>
