<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's expertise shines in precise needle work and understanding of "interlaced hush," rooting motivation in practiced micro-choices; fisherman's guilt compels revelation without stock phrasing. Internal conflict minimal—competence dominates without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, slightly limiting depth for elite publishability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot-unraveling builds density of released names ("Thomas Wayde," etc.) to cadence shift at dawn's final knot, delivering RR closure as net dissolves into mist with night's labor as felt cost. Orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's crystalline walls and starlight constrain release—names refract into light, charging final image; net's salt-black ropes tactilely mirror silence's weight. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Maren feels "resistance...deeper"); no white-room, all integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirit via silence-release) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through progressive knots narrowing to final one; agency in Maren's "intention[al]" precision forecloses scatter-risk with visible cost (all-night work). No reversals needed; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bound secrets as prisons emerges organically from net's knots yielding names, reweighted in prisms' light without statement; final image of grounded spirit offers resonant answer to hush's drowning power. Subtext in silences and fisherman's "trembled" hands; ambiguity lingers in ongoing calls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (anticipates needle's "weight," feels "interlaced hush"); voice textured, rhythmic ("needle singing its quiet song"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You know why"), distinct (echoing vs. steady); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in short unraveling beats; rhythm varies (long setup to clipped names). Metaphors purposeful ("silence...own kind of prison") without muddle or loops; clean syntax, specific verbs ("teased," "loosed"). Minor elevated diction fits mythic tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-restoration via net-excavation into fresh synthesis of grief's texture; "prisms caught each whispered name" inevitable from setup, risks poetic conceit successfully. No templates—spirit's shifting face and hush-logic feel originated, heightening closure stakes.</comment>
