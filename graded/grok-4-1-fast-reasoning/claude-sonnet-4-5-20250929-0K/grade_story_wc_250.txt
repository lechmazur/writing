<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like mirror flashes under job risk; guardian's silent traits compel via patterns. Internal conflict embodied in throat tightening before signaling. Minor label-speak ("silent empathy made visible") slightly genericizes epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to constellation map as Charged Poise/CR. Orientation anchored early at dock/canal. Closure cost legible in "half-spoken secret" carried forward, reconfiguring her future with felt risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dock, shutters, rain-slick planks constrain signaling (angled reflection reveals Witness). Sensory hierarchy: fading light narrows to flashes/shadows. Final shadows across canal charge closure image, mirroring internal alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save canals silently) signaled early; density escalation via hour-long signaling weaves map, narrowing to public exposure. Agency in flashes/weaving forecloses direct testimony. Cost felt in job risk persisting via indirect method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent empathy emerges via shutter/mirror dialogue, culminating in stars-overhead reprise reweighting shadows' power without statement. Complexity in power imbalance (guild vs. poor) avoids tidy moral. Final image answers "save or destroy" via indirect shine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to patterns/reflections; diction textured (e.g., "bruised light"). No dialogue. Minor register elevation ("spiralingly calm") jars slightly under tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with tension (short flashes build to hour summary); density high, images propel. Minor loops ("spiralingly calm" x2, "weave" variants) and "stillwater tension" artifact dull propulsion slightly. No closure touch; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wordless semaphore via shutters/mirror transforms silent guardian trope into communal protest map. Risky calm under fading light heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early patterns to constellation payoff.</comment>
