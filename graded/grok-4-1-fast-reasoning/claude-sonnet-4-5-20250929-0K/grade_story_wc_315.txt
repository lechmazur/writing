<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via buckle squeezes and finger aches revealing contradictory doubt and resolve under pressure; final endurance earned through predecessor contrast and notation defense. Micro-choices like instinctive notating anchor motivation. Voice-specific perceptual bias toward patterns elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from radio challenge to Command intervention to validation, with on-page RR closure (report stands) reconfiguring isolation as Charged Poise. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern tightening via inverted sequence pays off precisely. Cost legible in "watcher's burden" endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor and cloud sea constrain isolation, charging final image of "trees above sang with light"; buckle as micro-setting enables calm under radio pressure. Sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent pulses over visual catalog) reflects Vera's priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Ground insistence to Command's demand, narrowing to explanation trade-off; agency in patient detailing forecloses compromise with felt isolation cost. One decisive deepening sufficient and charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory/truth vs distortion emerges via tree patterns and predecessor notes, resonating in final "bearing witness...without flinching" as non-literal answer to burden question. Subtext in radio silences avoids moralizing; particulars reweight premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward light trails and muscle memory; dialogue subtext-laden (Command's "walk me through" tests resolve). Rhythmic control modulates from soft echo to certain recording; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., buckle history embeds backstory/motivation); varied syntax accelerates radio tension without loops or scaffolds. Final image propulsion flawless; zero figurative muddle in peak explanation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arboreal sci-fi communication and solitary observation transforms isolation trope; risk in "attentively inventive" notation system heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from muscle memory parallel to trees.</comment>
