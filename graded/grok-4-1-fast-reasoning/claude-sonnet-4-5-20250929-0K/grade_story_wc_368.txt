<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand her "gift" roots in embodied actions like pressing her palm to her chest, with internal conflict in gripping the table amid swaying; Chen applies pressure through revelations. Final purpose feels earned via micro-choices like asking to learn. Minor epiphany polish in "borrowed heart steady with purpose" line prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density to Charged Poise closure where Mira accepts apprenticeship, cost legible in "without being consumed by it." Orientation anchored early in tea house/te cliffs. Single scene causality tight, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tea house sway constrains Mira's grip on table edge; morpho wings charge final image of trembling understanding. Sensory hierarchy via light refraction mirrors dye master's priorities. Body/heart as micro-setting filters perception throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control unasked gift) signaled early, deepens via Chen's explanations narrowing to careful apprenticeship under Accumulative lens. Agency in "Can you teach me?" forces trade-off of consumption risk. Cost felt in light's burn potential charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening as iridescent pattern recognition emerges from wing/light images, reweighted non-literally in final toast/wings tremble resolving "illuminate without burning." No moralizing; ambiguity in legacy's weight lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to light/shadows; dialogue subtextual (Chen's indirect reveals pursue goal). Rhythmic control modulates with sway creaks. Distinct voices: Mira direct, Chen precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "quietly explosive" reprise purposeful as motif. Propulsion peaks in wing reveals without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of donor heart carrying "listener" gift with dye master's light-tracking transforms trope organically. Risky floating setting heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
