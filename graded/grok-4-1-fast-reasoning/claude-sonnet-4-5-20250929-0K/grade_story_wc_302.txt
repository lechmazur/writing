<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("eyes burned behind her veil," hands shook), with motivation shifting earned from revenge to comprehension via grandmother's book; contradictory impulses (thrill tempered by caution) act in scene, final recognition forecloses revenge path with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through cipher navigation to book discovery, culminating in CR closure ("library no longer lost," watch's purpose fulfilled) with legible conceptual cost in transformed understanding; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful—propagation delays constrain navigation, shelves "breathed," air "cardamom and forgotten names"—micro-setting (watch, journal) charges choices and final image; sensory hierarchy reflects quest urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken words) signaled early, escalates via density increase under Accumulative lens: cipher decoding narrows options, book deepens knowledge with emotional cost ("hands shook"); agency in documenting forces trade-offs, charges ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truths and loneliness emerges organically from particulars (grandmother's volume reveals self-deception); final image reweights premise non-literally ("documenting these truths would help others") with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noting "propagation delays," cyclic reversals); voice rhythmic and biased toward puzzle-solving, modulates intensity cleanly to charged poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm ("bloomed like cold fire" purposeful, not muddled); minor figurative density in revelation beat but integrated without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest trope via library of unspoken words, unfolding cipher in watch, propagation delays; risk-taking in nonlinear geometry and CR ending feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
