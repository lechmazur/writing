<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's interiority particularized through embodied exhaustion and methodical ritual; insomnia's contradiction acts in scene via persistent painting despite fatigue, earning sleep as renunciation with cost. Visions reveal values hierarchy without tidy epiphany. Minor reflection anchors concretely to brush without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: strokes accumulate visions densifying stake, cadence shifts at canvas completion into CR closure (complete phrase reweights kindness proof) with felt cost in sleep amid hollowing insomnia. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity and glass constrain ritual (traps breath, filters moon), orchids perfume defiance charging final image among them; smog contrasts internal hope, POV-filtered via painter's eye. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under insomnia; micro-setting (brush, canvas) indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vision density narrowing to self-proof; agency in strokes forecloses insomnia path with legible cost (eyes close after 72 hours). Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise in dream image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chained kindness emerges organically from saffron visions shifting to temporal proof, final dream reconfigures city-erasure premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars (persimmon, steam characters) invites ambiguity on remembrance's fragility. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (saffron/meditation synesthesia, moon library); rhythmic modulation under pressure (strokes accelerate visions) without filter excess or distance slips. Prose texture reflects insomniac mind's hopeful precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "saffron paint—her favorite, quiet as meditation, warm as remembering"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (moon "coin pressed against dirty cloth") supporting closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost languages as kindness archive via moon-brush ritual transforms trope of cultural erasure; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in dream's citywide defiance, inevitable in hindsight from grandmother's salvaged artifact.</comment>
