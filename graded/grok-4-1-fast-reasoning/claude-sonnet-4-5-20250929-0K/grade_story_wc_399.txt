<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Senna's motivation to preserve clearings is rooted in lifelong study and shown through micro-choices like marking pockets and consecrating the stone. Interiority concrete via peripheral sensing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal moment. Old man adds brief pressure without deepening relational crucible. Earned endurance in ongoing maintenance closes her arc solidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from descent to consecration; pockets accumulate to charged recognition. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration ("the clearings held...they would need maintenance") lands on-page with conceptual cost of perpetual attention. Orientation anchored early (parapet, dunes, prophet's death). Single scene adheres to defaults, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: parapet's hum and adjustments constrain descent and anchor vial; pavilion's breathing fabric mirrors murmuring. Peripheral awareness filters details purposefully. Parapet sand charges final consecration image. Atmosphere of whisperfield calm evolves with consecration, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading clearings) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pocket-sensing to consecration under Textural lens. Agency in half-knowing attention forecloses dissolution path. Cost legible in "maintenance—a line walker's regular visits." Minor slip: pressure leans internal without external antagonism test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving belief-defined spaces emerges organically from pockets, consecration, and realization ("wisdom...in the architecture of pause"). Final image ("whisperfield calm settled...like snow") reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in sideways glance avoids tidy moral. Resonance from particulars, no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of peripheral bias; diction selective ("half-knowing," "sideways glance"). Rhythm modulates from murmuring density to calm cadence. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Can you preserve...?"). No head-hopping; elision of direct creation taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "pockets revealed themselves" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops despite "murmuring" recurrence (purposeful pattern). Zero artifacts in closure beat; propulsion peaks at consecration whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-like clearings, kinetic mechanisms, line-walker peripheralism transforms spiritual-preservation trope. Risk in half-direct ritual pays off in charged poise closure. No echoes; world logic commits fully to implications.</comment>
