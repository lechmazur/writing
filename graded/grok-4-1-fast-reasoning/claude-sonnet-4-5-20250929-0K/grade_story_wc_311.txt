<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "heart—if she still possessed such a thing—surge with answering joy" then pivot to clarity of future decay, earning the renunciation parallel to predecessor's sacrifice with felt loneliness cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening reflections anchored to present cues; Conceptual Repricing closure in "named it sacrifice instead of cowardice" reconfigures premise with emotional cost of enduring loneliness legible in final step into dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracked telescope lens and scattered light constrain realizations, charging final image as Mira holds page to light and shadows writhe on her face, mirroring internal grief evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper loneliness via cartographic fears transforms trope organically; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes through echoing voices across centuries without gimmick.</comment>
