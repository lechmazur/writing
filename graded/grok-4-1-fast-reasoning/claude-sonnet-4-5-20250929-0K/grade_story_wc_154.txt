<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction—throbbing arm and floating mind fight anesthetic pull—earning resolve to act; contradictory impulses act in scene as shrewd refusal of "convenient narratives," compelling higher-stakes translation choice with visible cost of delayed action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of coral-notes-truth pattern; Charged Poise closure in hand gripping fragment reconfigures stakes with felt cost of truth's danger and festering wounds; orientation anchored early in atrium/Mindanao, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and coral convolutions constrain final grip and charge closure image, mirroring internal haze; sensory hierarchy narrows under anesthetic urgency to cast/pocket immediacies, filtering through translator's bridge-building bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. half-story fog signaled early, tightens accumulatively via note-decrypt deepening knowledge/options; anesthetic pressure forces endurance agency, with cost legible in "heart ached" poise and foreclosed rest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient truth-building emerges organically from coral channels and child notes, reweighting "festering" half-stories without moralizing; final coral grip offers resonant CR answer to translation's convolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in labyrinth/bridge metaphors biases noticing toward trapped meanings; rhythmic modulation accelerates in decrypt beat, compresses under stress without leakage; stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "anesthetic begin its slow bloom" advances plot/atmosphere/body); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors; purposeful elevated diction fits translator voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Child-cast encryption to coral-truth synthesis transforms pacific-zone tropes via translator's lens; risk of anesthetic-monologue introspection heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from fragment seed.</comment>
