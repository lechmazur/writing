<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in embodied details like "fingers blackened with tarnish" and "subdued ardor rising," driving her teaching as micro-choices under grief's pressure; Senna's arc from shaking hands to brooch creation earns change with visible cost in revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from Mara's isolation to Senna's piece and shared vigil; closure as Charged Poise in "curtains of intention parted slightly" reconfigures withering-to-bloom with legible emotional cost, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Timeless observatory constrains via spiral stairs and dome vigil, charging final image; recurring paper crane and brass instruments mirror renewal, with sensory selectivity (gleaming brass vs. green dome) biasing through Mara's restorative gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of renewal tightens texturally via Senna's steadying hands and brooch (one deepening foreclosing performative grief); agency in assignment to "illuminate" narrows options, cost felt in "not happiness exactly, but... possibility."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformative mourning emerges via particulars like brooch windows and stars as "genuinely artificial"; final image answers "curtains of intention" non-literally, reweighting premise with cost of betrayed origins unbetrayed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in jewelry metaphors ("weaving hair into lockets"); dialogue subtextual ("That's the withering talking") advances goal; rhythm modulates from confessional to vigilant poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("unfolded it to reveal coordinates"); varied rhythm propels without loops, though terminal "just enough" triplet borders pattern but serves cadence shift without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning artifacts (tears in resin, coord cranes) transforms grief tropes via observatory frame; risk in "genuinely artificial" stars/lockets heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</question>
