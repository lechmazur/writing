<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic motivation anchors Elena's arc, with embodied vertigo and tears revealing contradictory impulses under memory pressure; final transcription earns change via prior causality. Minor abstractness in "courageously kind" phrasing slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whale songs build density to entangled memories' pattern break, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "tears streaming... overwhelming intimacy," with felt emotional cost legible in final journal act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's stone floor and open sky constrain tile-pressing and charge final image of generational watch; whale vibrations integrate tactilely, mirroring internal braiding without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs inherited wisdom) tightens via memory deepening, forcing endurance of "impossible truths"; cost viscerally felt in tears, reweighting options under Accumulative lens, though no explicit trade-off narrows further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of relational knowledge emerges organically from tile/memories braiding doubt/wonder; final "bridge... doubt and wonder" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scientific patterns yielding to "bone and blood" resonance); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels reflection into action; no loops or scaffolds, though minor reflective telling in "understood then why" borders BRR limit without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magic square as mnemonic key for entangled whale-song guardianship transforms folklore/science trope into fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk of "impossible" glow pays off in charged lineage premise.</comment>
