<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory love and disapproval act simultaneously in her calculated confrontation and rehab offer, earning Vincent's breakdown as a visible relational cost. Interiority concrete via mathematical lens particular to her worldview. Vincent's thrill-to-tears arc reveals flaws complicating his defense.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens: Mara's active waiting → telling Jacobson → ink pot confrontation → rehab offer reconfigures options, landing Charged Poise closure with emotional cost legible in "Vincent Chen began to cry." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene holds without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room's "formaldehyde and flowers, that strange deathly vitality" constrains pretense-stripping dialogue and charges final image where it "strips away pretense." Ink pot as micro-setting recurs to mirror honesty. Sensory filter via Mara's meticulous gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose con for redemption) tightens via revelation of Jacobson call, narrowing father's options with relational price in tears. Agency in Mara's micro-choices forces stance crystallization under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Honesty's "mathematics" emerges organically from con vs. fair trade conflict, resonating in prep room's final reconfiguration without moralizing. Ink pot shifts from fraud tool to emblem of lost authenticity. Ambiguity lingers in redemption's odds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature (mathematical precision) stable in third-person limited; dialogue subtextual ("Hope is hope" evades vs. her "balance doesn't work"). Rhythm modulates from observation to peak stress without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: "words steady as a heart monitor's flat line" propels without loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic variety in short punchy exchanges vs. image-rich setups; no figurative muddle or register slips in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con family drama in death's honest prep room, with ink pot forging literal/metaphorical pivot. Mathematical honesty transforms redemption trope via daughter's tactical patience.</comment>
