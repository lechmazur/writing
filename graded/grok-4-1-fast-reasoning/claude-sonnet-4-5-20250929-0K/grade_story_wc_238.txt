<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's interiority shines in embodied guilt via the "induced current" felt through Chopin's page, revealing contradictory impulses of past sharpness and present remorse; final sincere apology earns her change with visible cost in incomplete redemption. Flaws like fear of ordinariness complicate choices organically. No diagnostic speak or stock phrasing undermines peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bottle sets confrontation, papers vortex escalates, river metaphor hesitates ghost, typing new article triggers settlement—clear because/therefore to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "can't give you back what I took" and fading scent. Orientation anchored early; single scene intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive's dust/perfume and swirling Brahms/Billie papers constrain manifestation and charge climax; orchard outside tightens stakes via impending chainsaws, mirroring internal thaw in final blossoms image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (music chaos horrifies archivist). No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology/exorcism) signaled early, tightens causally when feeling Vivienne's love via annotated page forces trade-off deletion; agency in metaphor/typing forecloses rage path with emotional cost felt in trembling bottle. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles theme emerges via river freeze metaphor and out-of-season blossoms reweighting words' lasting scars without moralizing; final orchard singing answers flawed redemption non-literally. Subtext in jasmine/regret layers complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "emotional electricity" bias; voice rhythm modulates from charged buildup to quiet cadence at "papers settled slowly." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via "Listen."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., short "Listen" amid rustling storm); metaphors coherent ("grief made tangible") without muddle in vortex peak. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise fresh via metaphor method transforming ghost trope; music annotations as emotional conduit and orchard blossoms risk bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight without derivative hedging.</comment>
