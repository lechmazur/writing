<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile actions like tracing the compass rose and sketching under flux; motivation to map transformation endures with isolation's cost legible in refusal to leave. Contradictory impulses toward blessing and pariah status layer realistically without tidy resolution. Minor reflection summary early slightly abstracts initial stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as temporal zone descriptions densify toward CR closure; final sketch and smile reconfigure isolation into charged poise with conceptual cost of adapted exile undeniable in "She could survive here, but she could never truly leave." Orientation anchors immediately; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Temporal zones and compass rose constrain navigation and charge final positioning at deck center; sensory details like warped beams and echoed sound filter through Maya's astronomer bias, evolving with her sketches. Micro-setting of pencil scratches arriving out-of-sync mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exploration amid isolation deepens accumulatively via zone glimpses compressing eternities, forcing endurance with cost of fatal normalcy crystallized in "her cellular structure had adapted." Agency in annual sketching crystallizes stance without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perspective shaping reality emerges organically from Andromeda sketches across times, reweighted in final "true north" realization without statement; resonant image of arcing trajectories answers transformation question non-literally with ambiguity of lonely charting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in temporal distortions like "sound bouncing through gradients"; rhythmic prose modulates from echoed silence to scratching pencil, diction biased toward astronomical idiom without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and reflection without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels from warped descriptions to crisp final beats, though minor metaphor density in supernova passage borders overwriting without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation as personal cartography transforms isolation trope; compass rose's distorted geometry risks bold metaphor payoff in "pointed nowhere and everywhere," heightening stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
