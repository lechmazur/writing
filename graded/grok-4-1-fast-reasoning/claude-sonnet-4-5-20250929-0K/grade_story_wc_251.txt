<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miss Chen's trait of hearing unspoken words roots her motivation and enables the inciting read of Danny's quitting; Danny's slump-to-lean arc shows contradictory impulses yielding earned choice. Final shoulder touch and sketch handoff reveal values hierarchy with cost of defying father. Minor epiphanic summary in reflection slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via dialogue beats layering revelation (grotto, sketches) to Charged Poise closure in Danny's decision and queen move; cost legible in foreclosed routine path. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (library, evening mist, chess setup). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt library's mist-wrapped windows and chessboard constrain gaze to town's geometry, mirroring internal rebellion; recurring blue glass reflection charges final lighthouse image. Sensory selection (hush, dimming lights) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (worn table, chipped queen) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Danny's quitting vs. free thinking) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through grotto reveal and sketches to decision with visible cost (father lie). Pressure coheres in disappointment-to-intrigue deepening. Agency in Miss Chen's persuasion forces Danny's stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of amplified quiet rebellion emerges organically via chess paths diverging, window symbols planting second thoughts; final queen move and lighthouse image offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting certainty's cost. No moralizing; subtext in silences and sketches invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Miss Chen's perceptual signature (hears unspoken, prophetic hush); dialogue distinct (Danny's blunt vs. her poetic). Rhythm modulates from hushed setup to charged close. Clean free indirect without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via image integration (pawn forward amid talk); no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("forests of second thoughts") purposeful without muddle. Elevated diction fits coach's voice without peak drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess as quiet rebellion via window displays transforms routine defiance trope; risk in prophetic tone heightens stakes organically. Danny's decision feels inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
