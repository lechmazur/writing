<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory impulses—intending to "hurry past" but kneeling despite training—act in scene, earning his final acceptance of the ongoing role with visible cost to routine certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations accumulate resonant exchanges, teaching mosaic pattern by merchant encounter (~20%), landing Charged Poise closure when Keeper returns pendant, reconfiguring carrier's purpose with transformation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway constrains path and charges images like "swirled into patterns" during flute harmony, mirroring internal proofs and filtering through Kael's messenger priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vibrations deepen stake by forcing extensions that foreclose routine delivery, with Kael's agency in pocketing seed and descending under lens pressure; minor abstractness in schedule cost prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final seed-planting image resonantly answers relic's purpose non-literally, reweighting encounters from interruptions to "germinate wonder" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in embodied tics ("ribs ache," finger twitches); dialogue distinct (merchant's "myth-telling" vs. Keeper's secrets).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in encounter beats, varied rhythm; opening "trembled against Kael's sternum" anchors perfectly, minor metaphor density in aurora doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of vibrating relics transforming journeys via sympathetic fragments feels inevitable and fresh, transforming quest trope through absence-as-guide.</comment>
