<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in daughter's question drives consistent micro-choices like climbing and promising; interiority concrete via dust analysis and ghost engagement. Final promise earns change with felt cost of added burden. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ghost's point to box discovery to promise, reconfiguring stake. Charged Poise closure in ghost's smile and fade with legible emotional cost ("weightless burden"). Orientation anchored early in ticket office; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust patterns and water-stained tiles constrain choice via professional observation, charging discovery. Sensory details (flickering lights dying, must-exhaling walls) filter through POV bias, mirroring internal presences. Final image of tucking box recharges grimy setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (follow ghost's urgency to uncover hidden) signaled early, tightens via disturbed dust find narrowing to carousel heart. Agency in climbing and promise forecloses non-action path with burden cost. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens but lacks deeper reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden histories emerging via box/photo/inscription offers resonant non-literal answer in promise, reweighting ceilings as preservation sites. Subtext in ghost's relief avoids moralizing; daughter's cue anchors without intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mechanical voices, dust as presences). Voice modulates rhythmically, e.g., "weightless burden" echoes without monotony. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("The carousel... This powered it?").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "dust lay thick and undisturbed, but there, along one tile's edge... disturbance" advancing action and specificity. Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent (mainspring as heart). Minor scaffold in reflective phrasing doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repairman's ghost-sight and horologist's relic transforms ghost trope via dust forensics and carousel heart. Risk in quiet supernatural promise heightens emotional specificity; no template echoes.</comment>
