<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's shift from watchful dreamer to actor earned through embodied tension (doesn't flee) and micro-choice to invite collaboration; notebook revelation reveals contradictory admiration, forcing protective vulnerability to crack with cleansing tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (icicles, moss) deepen to notebook RR closure; cost legible in "Maya's protected vulnerability cracked open" with tears, reconfiguring isolation to shared witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss corridors and icicle drips constrain observation ritual and charge final "green cathedral" image, mirroring transformation; selective sensory filter (green light, crystalline patterns) reflects POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning tightens via Chen's arrival/notebook, forcing endurance of vulnerability with embodied cost (tears); agency in acceptance forecloses passive solitude under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of destruction/creation as partners emerges organically from icicle patterns to notebook grafting; final image pressing notebook to pendant offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns as scripture); dialogue subtextual (Chen's pause) distinguishes voices, rhythm modulates from hush to pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates setting/action (moss-carpeted pathway); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, purposeful figurative (cathedral of reconciliation) taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession, reclaimed data center, and icicle scripture transforms guilt tropes; risk in nature/tech ambiguity heightens stakes organically.</comment>
