<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's contradictory impulses—resisting then following the clock hand's spin—act simultaneously in the restructuring scene, earning his final renunciation of stasis with embodied cost in the "luminous ache." Grandmother backstory anchors precisely to present cues like tremors, tilting micro-choices without drag. Chen applies targeted pressure via urgency, revealing status shift when understanding dawns. Flawless individualization through perceptual bias and micro-choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tremors and lunar pulses accumulate density, teaching pattern early for causal ellipsis to restructuring; closure as Charged Poise RR reconfigures instruments with cost of "old parameters gone" legible in the humming array. Orientation anchors who/where/when by para 2. Single scene scope flawless, no shards needed. Cost proof: exact line "The moon would slip away... capturing light across the growing distance" makes before/after undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—tremors disrupt workbench, dome's light catches brass spin—forcing tactile navigation; recurring observatory (struts, bedrock, aperture) charges final image of silver clouds below. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Kenji hears tremors through bones, sees lunar pulse. Micro-setting via chronometer guts and orrery integrates action, mirroring internal shift without overt symbol. No generic placeholders; all details pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (adapt to orbital decay) signaled early, tightens via realization—"It's the orbital decay"—forcing agency in restructuring that forecloses stasis path. Accumulative escalation: pattern break in clock hand resolving ellipses narrows options, with felt price in "bittersweet recognition." Chen's urgency adds coherent pressure; cost unmistakable in moon "already infinitesimally farther." Minor slip: no explicit loss beyond emotional ache, but charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing inevitable departure emerges organically from spinning hand to restructured array, final image ("clouds below glowed silver") offering non-literal resonant answer via conceptual repricing of "escape velocity." Subtext in gestures like placing hand back; no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable: harnessing ephemeral confronts change. Counter-reading lingers in acceptance's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited on Kenji; perceptual signature in precision-instrument grammar ("grammar of precision instruments"). Voice modulates rhythm with pressure—short sentences in tremors, flowing in realization. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: Chen's "You're not trying to restore" advances via dawning understanding. No head-hopping; diction POV-apt (sage repairer idiom).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "The spinning clock hand blurred faster" advances plot/foreshadows). Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Figuratives purposeful/consistent (clockwork heart, escape velocity), no muddle in peak restructure beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sage repairer's listening method transforms orbital decay premise into personal reconfiguration, risking lyric acceptance over conflict. Non-obvious angle on moon's "leaving" via instrument adaptation feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold tonal risk (luminous ache amid loss) heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; organic tropes.</comment>
