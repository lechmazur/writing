<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's spatial gift particularizes interiority and compels insight into permeability; contradictory impulses act in button press/release embodying release cost. Minor therapy-speak ("analyzing where we failed") borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure. Chen's pressure as catalyst feels earned via shared network mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds observations to CR closure in button placement and delete decision, reweighting holding-on premise with release cost legible in "releasing the pressure she'd maintained." Orientation anchored early; no shards or ambiguity. Persistent constraint of spatial analysis shapes final image payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow pulses "like slow breaths," mirroring internal shift and constraining observation that enables insight; mushrooms as "nodes with optimal flow-through" charge final permeable image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's network bias. Micro-setting (fungi beds) guides epiphany without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (let go of ex via analysis) signaled early, deepens via Chen dialogue and button to foreclose holding path; Accumulative cadence shift reweights stake in realization with felt energy cost. Agency in admission and release crystallizes stance. One tightening sufficient, charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Permeability theme emerges organically from mushroom networks and security contrast, resonating in final image without moral; "quiet wildfire" shifts from Chen's work to Mara's arc. Minor echo borders articulation ("physics of letting go") but subtext in silence prevails. Complexity lingers in flawed endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with network perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulate from calm observation to charged realization. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're mapping permeability"), distinct voices in idioms. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; rhythm varies with scene pulse, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("quiet wildfire" reprise) purposeful as motif charging closure. Propulsion clear in sequence to button metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion specialist's networks, mushroom permeability, and button release transforms letting-go trope; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes via embodied physics. Inevitable hindsight from spatial gift constraint. No derivatives; bold voice anchors vision.</comment>
