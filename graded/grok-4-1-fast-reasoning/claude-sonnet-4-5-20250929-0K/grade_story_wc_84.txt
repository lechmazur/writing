<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's sharp-eyed observation and perpetual surprise embody consistent traits that motivate her quest for belonging, earning the shift to purposeful finder via pilgrim's pressure and chip insertion; internal conflict surfaces in her felt isolation reframed without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from drone feeds to trail revelation and dispatch, with clear orientation in observatory at arrival; closure as CR lands on-page in "She wasn't missing pieces. She was the one meant to find them," reweighting isolation with conceptual cost of lifelong search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cracked dome and weathered steps constrain drone launches through open sky, charging final pulsing trails; dusk's "brilliant dimness" mirrors internal shift, selective sensory details (amber light, drone hum) filter via Mara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging signaled early tightens accumulatively via chip's pulse revealing trails, narrowing to global retrieval with agency in drone dispatch; cost legible in reframed isolation charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Belonging as connectable frequency emerges via chip pieces and trails without direct moralizing, resonating in final image of singing signal; pilgrim's explanatory lines border thematic echo but integrate via action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of surprised wonder; voice texture modulates poetically from feeds to awe, dialogue natural/subtextual distinguishing pilgrim's soft reverence from Mara's directness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density weaves setting/action; purposeful "brilliant dimness" recurrence teaches pattern without loop, minor overwriting in light descriptions contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech, foundry chip relic, and cosmic belonging trails transforms isolation trope; risk in mystic-tech mandala pattern heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
