<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trust the rope over tech drives all choices, embodied in her calloused hands and seven-year vigils; interiority concrete via rope thrumming felt before instruments. No simultaneous contradictory impulses act in scene—steady competence without visible internal fracture lowers from 9+. Final override earns her endurance with storm's cost on buttresses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rope vibration density builds to switch, ringing, storm passage. Orientation anchored early (Mara on Mount Kelspar by para 2). Closure as Charged Poise in "released the rope and watched it settle," reconfiguring tech vs. human debate with cracked buttresses as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope as micro-setting constrains choices, handled tactilely from opening to "hemp fibers between her fingers" finale, charging image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: wind patterns, solstice hush amplify urgency. Buttresses cracking evolves environment causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accurate warning sans false alarms) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when rope precedes instruments, forcing switch/ringing agency. Escalation via deepening vibration narrows to endurance; cost legible in holding through storm cracking stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening/human intuition over noise emerges via rope as "elegant and old" tech, reweighted in final settling image without statement. Resonant non-literal answer: mountain "demanded" voice, valley safe, proving her stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature: atmospheric reading via hands/rope. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to thrumming; diction biased to microclimate textures. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate sensation/action (e.g., "deep thrumming... warm air from the valley met crystalline cold"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in ringing pattern amid storm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bell rope as storm detector fresh synthesis of ancient tech intuition vs. modern systems; risk in manual override heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: founders' positioning enables her vindication.</comment>
