<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's interiority shines in quantifying absence and sensing "falling upward and downward," rooting her motivation in profession-specific fragmentation; man's parole-driven quest compels her micro-choices like incising darkness. Contradictory impulses act when she carves absence into new patterns, earning the hand-off reconfiguration. Final endurance of the lull shows credible renunciation of tidy closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as images (clouds, moonlight, absences) densify toward Charged Poise closure in Vera's final quantification of "new absence," reweighting infinite beginnings with ongoing suspension cost. Orientation anchors by para 2 (Vera's counter, first day lull). Single scene causality links entry chime to bottle ritual without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard's transparent fruit and cloud-sea constrain ritual (third-tier grove, glass roots) and charge final image of swirling clouds "scatter[ing] and reform[ing]"; sensory selection (prismatic fragments, crystal chime) filters via Vera's priorities. Setting mirrors internal fragmentation, evolving with library shift post-hand-off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erasing past via absence) tightens accumulatively through incising drop and man's recognition, narrowing to potential rewrite with visible cost in emptied bottle and persistent lull. Agency in Vera's blade-work forces stance crystallization; parole pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings as voids emerges implicitly from bottle ritual and cloud patterns, culminating in resonant final image where "chapters arrang[e] themselves into something that might...cohere," reweighting fragmentation without moral statement. Subtext layers in parole glimmers versus carved darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (quantified absences, light as memory) biases noticing toward prismatic refractions; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive lull to incising intensity. Dialogue carries subtext ("place where stories begin") and advances via implication; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density packs sensory propulsion ("drop...spread like reverse ink") with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—darkness incised purposefully. Final line recharges motifs without overwriting, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library as floating orchard selling moonlight-memories transforms clean-slate trope via subtraction logic; risk in "incise patterns into the darkness" feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable glass-cloud integration.</comment>
