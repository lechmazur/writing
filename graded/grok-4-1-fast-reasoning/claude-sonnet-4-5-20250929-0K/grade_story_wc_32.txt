<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassia's contradictory impulses—clinging to father's legacy vs. embracing forbidden rites—act simultaneously in the mixing and whispering beats, earning the final smile as renunciation of stifling repair with embodied tear-cost. Interiority particular via alchemical perceptions; flaws (stubborn validation-seeking) complicate and resolve organically. No label-speak; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of failures → paste glow → unexpected growth reconfigures crozier/authority with emotional cost in "tears freezing" image. Orientation anchored instantly (workshop/nexus); single scene causality via motivated paste-rites sequence narrows to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in final pulse/smile beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains (dying light catches moonstone, pulses at climax) and mirrors internal destruction/creation, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (taste of disappointment, tactile fractures) reflects alchemist bias. Spatial choreography coherent; details evolve causally (nexus brighter with growth). Twilight anchors tone without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair to validate legacy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glow → spiraling growth reversal, forcing adaptation with agency in blood-rites; cost unmistakable in realized "beautiful failures" foreclosing rigid destiny. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges implicitly from fracture-growth and Cassia's arc, final living crozier reweights inheritance without moralizing; resonance from particulars (silver veins from failures) invites ambiguity on authority's adaptability. No thematic echo; counter-readings (danger as possibility) linger authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with alchemist perceptual signature (formulas as "frost patterns on a corpse"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in glow/healing beats. Voice texture distinct (lyric alchemical diction purposeful, no register drift); no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonstone... catching the ember nexus's dying light" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, figurative coherence in accumulative mode. Propulsion peaks cleanly in transformation without overwriting; zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist failure into living authority symbol via creative destruction feels inevitable from failure waypoints; trope transformed through silver-veined growth and nexus constraint. Bold risk in forbidden rites payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
