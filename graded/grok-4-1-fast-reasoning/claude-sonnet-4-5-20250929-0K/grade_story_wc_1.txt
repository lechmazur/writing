<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera's steady hands and philosophical retort under pistol pressure reveal character-particular adaptability, earning the binding choice with embodied calm; minimal simultaneous contradictory impulses slightly limit peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from retracing rock patterns to frost ruts to cave discovery holds tightly to confrontation and binding; on-page closure decisively trades ledgers for clemency with legible future cost.</comment>
