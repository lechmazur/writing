<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in acoustic perceptions; contradictory impulses (ideal for work, terrible at ignoring) act in scene via persistent mapping despite burden. Final renunciation of doubt earned by film negative revelation, foreclosing isolation with lighter legacy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wall vibrations to diary fragments to film negative pattern break, culminating in Conceptual Repricing closure where Maya integrates into walls' dreaming. Cost legible in "legacy's burden felt lighter now," reconfiguring her stance with conceptual price of ongoing solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy as recurring micro-setting constrains (nervous system linking buildings) and charges final exhale image, mirroring internal states through tactile rustle without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy acoustic-focused via POV profession integrates seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls' dreams) signaled early, tightens via film negative deepening knowledge/options under Accumulative lens. Protagonist agency in renewed microphone run forces endurance with felt cost of continued isolation crystallized at close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of space-memory conversation emerges organically from particulars like ghost-pressure echoes; final image offers resonant answer ("dreaming with them") reweighting premise without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature in acoustic biases ("conversations in the way sound bent"); rhythmic control modulates from exploratory to charged realization without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ivy rustled though no wind" advances setting/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dreaming architecture and ivy circuits transforms haunted-space trope; risk in forward-echo premise inevitable via negative's self-image, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
