<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand grandmother's silence intensifies through concrete micro-choices like tracing lace to trim bonsai; internal shift ("something shift inside her") embodied and earned, foreclosing path of loss-seeking with cost of patient tending. Takeo as secondary applies relational pressure via demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of revelations tightening to CR closure ("Mira understood... cultivating what remained"); cost legible in "careful, patient work of tending living things," reweighting inheritance; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai tools and driftwood table constrain teaching choices; wet sand, breezy grasses, cerulean horizon selectively sensory and mirror internal renewal, charging final sun-descent image with apology shades.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding silence signaled early, deepens accumulatively via lace instructions linking to severance; agency in Mira following pattern narrows to endurance of unspoken cost, legible in trembling compass and horizon stare.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating forgiveness from silence emerges organically from lace/bonsai particulars; resonant CR end reweights motifs (tides, blue) without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on healing's patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Mira's perceptual bias (horizon weight); lyrical rhythm modulates revelation ("diffuse like ink in water"); Takeo's slow idiom distinct vs. Mira's directness, dialogue subtext advances stakes.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor artifacts like repeated "rhythmically placid" and overwrought "shades of apology and forgiveness" slightly dull peak revelation; closure image propels cleanly without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lace-woven instructions transforming inheritance trope into bonsai growth metaphor; risk of lyric density pays off in charged poise, non-obvious blue of apologies inevitable from particulars.</comment>
