<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's mathematical rooting for lots and quiet persistence amid doom compel her teaching choice, earning Kael/staff transformation; embodied visions ("static wash over her consciousness") reveal character under pressure. Minor slip: Kael's arc tells more than shows internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds revelation density from coin toss to alignment instruction, culminating in on-page CR closure ("wavelength aligning with purpose, transforming") with conceptual cost of oblivion vs. transformation legible in final image. One tightening via static bursts suffices; pattern taught early, holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber dome/crystal filters light evolution (deepens to white), constraining alignment ritual and charging closure image; headset/static integrate tactilely into action, POV-filtered via Mira's frequencies. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under bursts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive crunch via alignment) signaled early, deepens via backwards visions narrowing to coin pattern; agency in distilling/teaching forecloses oblivion path with felt cost in final white light. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reception over prediction emerges organically from coin/static particulars, reweighting randomness as deterministic truth; final image non-literally answers "instruction for what?" without moralizing, lingering with transformation ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mira yields perceptual signature (causality eddies as math); dialogue subtext-driven (Kael's "Teach me" shifts status), rhythmic prose modulates from doubt to clarity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "coins hadn't predicted... received instructions") propels with varied syntax/rhythm; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (death rattle patterns) enhance without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contracting universe + backwards coin prophecy transforms end-times trope via math/randomness; risk in temporal eddies pays off inevitably at alignment, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
