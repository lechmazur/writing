<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in bead's hum and family whispers intensifies credibly to forgiveness choice; embodied reactions like bead "burning hot" reveal character under pressure. Ghost's grief shows contradictory impulses in "lovingly venomous" backstory. Final release earned by causal buildup, foreclosing curse with felt generational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bead's pulse → ghost manifestation → revelation → planting → dawn DC with legible cost in released vigil. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's fogged panes, silver apples, mercury-rose scent constrain planting and charge final dawn image splitting endless night. Sensory details POV-filtered through Marcus's bone-deep hum; evolves causally with shudder/light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (family debt) signaled early, tightens via revelation of love-needed formula narrowing to forgiveness agency. Escalation causal under lens; cost visible in bead burial foreclosing eternal wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive love over venomous ambition emerges organically from Eleanora's backstory and Marcus's release; final gold apples/new trees reweight premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in bead's "frequency...in his bones"; dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (instruction to plant). Rhythm modulates tension to peace; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from "temperature dropped like a stone" to shuddering closure; no loops, metaphors consistent (smoke veil, silver-to-gold). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical ghost-redemption via bead-key transforms trope; bead's harmonic pulse and planting synthesize premise organically, risking supernatural forgiveness payoff.</comment>
