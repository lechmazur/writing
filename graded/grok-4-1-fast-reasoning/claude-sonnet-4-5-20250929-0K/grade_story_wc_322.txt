<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in weaving beat—"hands moved without planning, threading... creating patterns that felt both deliberate and instinctive"—reveals contradictory impulses via shifting memories, earning final acceptance with embodied calm; solo POV flawless, motivation intensifies via eruptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: entry to weaving to eruptions to pulse tightens via density of revelations; on-page CR closure—"pattern pulsed once, brilliantly"—reprices memories as living with conceptual cost of perpetual redesign legible in final calm; orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gallery illusions constrain via "precise angle" door and hooks guiding weave; body/tool (hands/sinew) charges final image of standing amid creation; sensory hierarchy via architect POV selective and purposeful, spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restructure shifting memories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via eruptions narrowing to acceptance; agency in instinctive weaving forecloses fixed-memory path with felt cost in "peace of accepting that nothing remains as it was"; one tightening sufficient, charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of connections as "constant reweaving" emerges via particulars (shifting sister/father memories), final image—"geometric proof that connection thrives... because of it"—resonates non-literally, reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity in flux lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with architect perceptual signature ("rational enchantment... logic and impossibility married"); rhythmic control modulates to peak in "wove faster, understanding flooding through her fingers"; purposeful compression in memory shards legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"sinew thread grew as she pulled it, impossible yet undeniable"—no loops/artifacts; varied syntax/rhythm supports accumulative build, specific diction (tremors, self-protection) over generics; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream architecture and sinew-weaving transforms memory trope via organic pattern-map; risk in solo experiential arc heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from gallery premise to "endless reweaving" closure.</comment>
