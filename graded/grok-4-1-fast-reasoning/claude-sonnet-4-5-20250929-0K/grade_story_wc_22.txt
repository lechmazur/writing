<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in inherited gift shines through concrete actions like seed placement, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; endurance feels earned yet unpressured. Minor slip in flaw-complication doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to precise planting guided by birds, landing CR closure in "first seeds began their work of reclamation" with conceptual cost of patience over war. Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jetty's cracks, dew-slick boards, and submerged springs constrain planting choices precisely; recurring "submerged concord" charges final image. Sensory details (salt-crusted, barnacled) filter through coachman's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclamation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird-guided deepening that narrows placement options; cost felt in working into darkness. Pressure coherent but mild—no live opposition beyond environment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of battlefield-to-garden redemption emerges organically from seeds, birds, and dead languages; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtle ambiguity in "battlefield must die" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (bird calls as ancient tongues); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to incantatory. Self-talk to bird in dead languages reinforces voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel accumulatively; no loops or scaffolds. "Narrow pathway stretched... into infinity" exemplifies propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war reclamation via bird-oracle in dead languages transforms healing trope; risk in linguistic layering heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight from grandmother cue.</comment>
