<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via cartographic eye perceiving subtle shift ("a single stone... had shifted"), with motivation intensifying to compel leaving doors open; minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of discoveries (shifted stone to question-mark cracks), yielding CR closure in final image of stepping through "torn open" map with conceptual cost of abandoning preservation; orientation anchored immediately, lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vault and fresco constrain choices (sealed access forces video method) and charge final image (cracks as question mark mirroring henge gap); sensory details like "rain hammered... whispered prayers" filter through POV bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode whispers via changes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through stone shift narrowing to henge gap, forcing stance crystallization with felt cost in open doors and entering unknown; single tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as empathetic map emerges organically from shifted stone pointing to "gap" and question-mark cracks, with final image offering resonant CR repricing ("step through to the unknown") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing "subtle realignment" via trained eye); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under realization pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm (e.g., short punchy sentences at discovery: "There."); zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; peak beats clean of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms haunted vault trope into self-updating map via video comparison and empathetic decoding; risk in quiet CR closure heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
