<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to save the orchard roots in consistent prophetic traits, with embodied resonance feelings and micro-choices like striking sequences compelling higher-stakes command. Interior conflict subtle in counter-instinct trust vs. Deren's hesitation. Deren applies relevant pressure without diluting focus. Minor reflection slips don't flatten closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note density builds to chord mapping clouds, enabling perpendicular drift. Orientation anchored early (Maren on orchard at blue hour). Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with cost in "backwards-flowing faith" as vortex rages nearby, reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant (tree hums, euphony) filters through Maren's prophetic bias, constraining anchor choices. Copper-wrapped trees as micro-setting recur to charge final "copper-wound trees singing." Blue hour atmosphere tensions fractal clouds purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vortex avoidance) signaled early, tightens via fractal contraction forcing counter-intuitive ballast shift under accumulative lens. Agency in Maren's dubbing narrows options with trust cost legible in tilt "toward the eastern darkness." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges organically from tree-playing and sea-adaptation particulars. Final image of fading euphony offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Deren's hesitation enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in "resonance...sketch itself across her awareness." Dialogue natural/subtextual (Deren's instinct vs. Maren's correction). Rhythmic modulation builds urgency; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., mallet strike advances sound/action/interpretation). Purposeful lyric repetition (fractal, resonance) taught early, no loops obscuring closure. Varied rhythm propels to final image without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-oracle post-flood world transforms survival tropes via copper trees and leeward reading. Risky fractal mechanics heighten stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in "every obstacle became an instrument."</comment>
