<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and motivation rooted in transforming pain, with insomnia as earned endurance showing contradictory impulses; final "smiled and began again" reveals values hierarchy with cost of perpetual vigil. Minor label-speak like "reef-shadow joy" slightly abstracts embodiment but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from past discovery to present poem and future intent; closure as Charged Poise in "peace with the ache itself" reconfigures longing with felt cost of ongoing insomnia, legible in final image of postcard and dawn shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell setting anchors early and constrains via amplification of voice and embedded poems, charging closure; wind and postcard integrate tactilely, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism—"reef-shadows across her walls of poems" evolution ties to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pain-to-beauty transformation signaled early, escalates texturally via war poem deepening to wind persistence; agency in attention forecloses sleep with insomnia cost legible throughout, though external pressure muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of longing's beauty emerges organically from shell layers, galaxy, and armistice image without statement; final "blossom armistice: not the end of wanting, but peace with the ache" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (oceanic metaphors, nacre gleam) stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, compression purposeful and pattern-taught early via shell spiral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, vivid rhythm varying sentence length; minor paraphrase loops in "accumulated... layer upon layer" and "transforming" repetitions dull slightly but don't obscure closure image of dawn light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomniac poet in living shell transforms insomnia trope via photosynthetic pain alchemy; "cherry trees" declaring armistice and wind's "failing beautifully" inflections feel inevitable from established oceanic pattern.</comment>
