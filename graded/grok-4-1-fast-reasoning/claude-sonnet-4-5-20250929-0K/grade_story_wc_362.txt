<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hartley's trembling fingers on the hood and admission of fear embody his contradiction between empirical grounding and grief-driven belief; Elena's surge of validation layers realistically with her mystic pursuit under funding pressure. Final commitment earned via causal revelation. Micro-choices like prism use reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost patterns deepen via prism, compelling Hartley's confession and joint photo before sun erasure as Charged Poise closure with time/emotional cost legible in "preserving evidence that science might someday understand." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost on windshield constrains revelation and photo choice, charging final image; quartz arbor's crystalline glow and singing wind mirror emotional absorption premise. Sensory refraction through mist/prism filters via Elena's priorities, evolving with sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emotion absorption for funding) signaled early, tightens texturally via Hartley's conversion and frost evidence; agency in prism use and photo forecloses doubt with erasure cost. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to shared purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Objects as witnesses emerges via frost faces and arbor's absorbed memories, reweighting inert-matter premise in final image without statement; wife's face in ice offers non-literal answer to emotional retention question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third Elena with clean focalization; Hartley's "truthful lies" paradox distinguishes voice idiom from Elena's directness. Rhythmic modulation peaks in confession; perceptual signature via light-bending observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from mist-clung branches to arbor's singing closure. Figuratives like "crystallized in water molecules" integrate without muddle in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost encoding car-borne emotions transforms everyday object into emotional archive; Hartley's paradox-laden support synthesizes skeptic-mystic tension with non-obvious payoff in photo preservation.</comment>
