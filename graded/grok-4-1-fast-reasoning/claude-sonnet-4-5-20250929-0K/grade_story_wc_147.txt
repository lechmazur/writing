<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Mara's lingering fingers on the vial versus hauling Chen, earning the final renunciation with clear cost; Chen's obsession flaw drives secondary pressure without stereotypes. Interiority concrete and embodied throughout crisis. Voice distinction clear in dialogue under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal leads to temple discovery, vial temptation tightens to override, landing Earned Stasis closure with cost in "pocket the vial and disconnect from its intoxicating pull." Orientation anchored early in descent. Single scene with seamless ascent transition fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple's "limestone pillars draped in kelp like funeral shrouds" constrains ascent and charges final image of dissolving shrine; sensory hierarchy narrows to oxygen alarm and vial warmth under crisis. Details evolve causally with rise. POV bias filters professionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue vs. temptation) signaled early, tightens via Chen's alarm and her "every fiber... wanted to keep touching," forcing agency in override with visible cost of foregone immersion. Pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unharnessable beauty emerges organically from vial's emotional pull and temple's "lonesome splendor," reweighted in final "ancient hearts still beating, trapped in crystal loneliness" without moralizing. Complexity in competing desires lingers. No Thematic Echo despite close lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in phrases like "gathered hush of the deep"; dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Chen's "I can't leave it"). Rhythmic control modulates with ascent tension. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "kelp like funeral shrouds, beautiful and desolate"; varied rhythm accelerates in alarm beat, no loops or artifacts. Final image propels with precision. Zero scaffold in closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artifact temptation in emotion-preserving vial transforms lost-civilization trope via textured memories; risk in quiet renunciation heightens conceptual stakes. Inevitable in hindsight from temple's hush to vial's pulse.</comment>
