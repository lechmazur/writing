<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moth's drifting alertness effectively contrasts her precise hands during the painting beat, rooting motivation in consistent traits that compel the encoding choice. Interiority feels embodied without stock phrasing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal moment, preventing exceptional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: ghost's electric thank-you on tools reconfigures mutual isolation with felt emotional cost in the final image. Single scene anchors orientation early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and lightning/thunder constrain painting pace and charge final lightning flash, mirroring internal states through fog-drenched action. Sensory details (vapor embrace, thunder drum) filter via Moth's priorities, evolving with weather urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode ghost's needs) signaled early tightens via thunder-forced speed and ghost's watchful presence, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in mural/bolts culminates in reciprocal response with legible emotional cost, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voiceless connection emerges organically from encoding acts and motifs like pressed flowers/light paths, reweighting loneliness in ghost's response without moralizing. Final ballad image offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing ambiguity of ongoing solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tinkersong wonder, drifting notice) stable in third-close POV, modulating rhythm with pressure. Perceptual bias selective; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in humming closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short urgent strokes amid thunder), high density integrates action/atmosphere; minor loop in "driftingly alert" repetition (-0.3) and occasional stacked modifiers slightly dull peak painting beat, but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-encoded emotions, quantum ghost, and floating monasteries transforms tropes via specific logic (symbols as frequencies); risk-taking in lyric Accumulative frame heightens resonance, with closure's dual messaging inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
