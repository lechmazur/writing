<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marta's blithe trait roots motivation consistently, with chess loss catalyzing higher-stakes decoding; interiority concrete in tracing symbols and aligning letter. Internal conflict emerges in contrasting living intentions vs. organized dead, embodied in silo's gloom. Final endurance to visit graves earned by prior pattern-seeking, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak realization scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chess insight to symbol-grave link, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where tapestry center reconfigures border as intentional archive ("These weren't coding errors"). Orientation anchored early in drive past cemetery; closure cost legible in "the game was just beginning," foreclosing blithe ignorance with deepened familial duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silo's velveteen darkness and peeling spirals constrain solitary decoding, filtering through Marta's gardener bias (marigolds, headstones). Stars through broken roof charge final image, mirroring cosmic intentions; sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile tracing under lantern urgency. Recurring tapestry as micro-setting enables key alignment, evolving with her perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding grandmother's intentions—tightens accumulatively via chess epiphany forcing letter-tapestry overlay, narrowing to seven graves. Agency in micro-choices like counting symbols forecloses misreading with cost of inherited truth; pressure coheres without reversal overload, but deepening feels reflective over visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden intentions emerges organically from chess trap, frayed symbols, and blithe archiving; subtext in "dead tenderly organized" vs. wild living reweights via CR. Final image resonates non-literally, answering premise without moralizing: silo's echoes parallel grandmother's tapestry. Complexity lingers in moral ambiguity of obscured lives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: symbols as "chess positions," borders like grandmother's tapestry. Voice texture modulates from drive's moonlight to silo's charged poise, rhythmic control in short declarative realizations ("The legible fragments... were coordinates"). No head-hopping; diction biased to gardener-chess lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action-image-reflection without loops (e.g., "traced the border... counting spaces" advances concretely). Rhythm varies for emphasis, metaphors coherent ("velveteen gloom lifting" clears for "cold light"). Zero artifacts; final line recharges cobalt sentinel motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery symbols as cipher for misrecorded lives, transformed via chess lens and sovereign case payoff. Risk in elliptical realization heightens stakes without gimmick; tapestry-graves arc inevitable in hindsight, committing to premise's archival ingenuity.</comment>
