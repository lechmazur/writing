<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority grounds motivation in concrete traits like "sound bloomed as color," compelling the dance; final fade as earned stasis forecloses individuality with felt cost, though contradictory impulses act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via temporal knots holds to CR closure; "the tarot coin shattered, releasing its stored time" reconfigures timeline into spiral with conceptual cost of self-dissolution, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mystic orchard/maze constrains luring via glow amplification and anchors synesthetic dance; recurring apple trees "heavy with fruit that bloomed and withered simultaneously" charge final image, filtering through ghost's biased urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor unraveling self) signaled early tightens via echo accumulation under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in dance; audience convergence forecloses isolation with cost in "Margaux finally faded," legible in golden applause.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of performance transcending time emerges organically from particulars like intertwined echoes; final spiral image non-literally answers existence question, reweighting premise with cost of individuality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with synesthetic perceptual signature ("midnight blue tasted like copper"); rhythmic modulation heightens dance pressure, purposeful compression of temporal shards legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("footsteps painted aurora patterns"); varied rhythm avoids loops, minor figurative density in dance beat purposeful and pattern-taught without muddling closure chime cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost dance synthesizing temporal recursion and tarot coin feels inevitable; bold nonlinear risk heightens closure resonance, transforming tropes via orchard's eternal weave.</comment>
