<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's arc from curious child to archivist feels earned through recognition at vial immersion and language study; Madame Verity's traits consistently drive prophecy and succession. Minor flaw: child's emotions lean abstract before embodiment in chest-unlock moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: field trip vial touch → prophecy → 20-year preparation → ledger acceptance as DC with felt weight/cost. Two-shard structure transitions legibly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard atop skyscraper constrains via grafted soil and pavilion access, charging prophecy amid falling blossoms; foghorn silence as recurring object reweights silence's premise at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional preservation tightens via prophecy narrowing Marcus's path and acceptance foreclosing normal life; cost legible in "weight of becoming." Agency in his return and immersion drives under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotional echoes over facts emerges via wax shavings and dead tongues, resonant in final ledger handoff reweighting city's memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward ancient/modern tension; voice rhythmic and biased via "honey and ash" diction. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in prophecy line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "wax shavings moved like living things"; zero loops, varied rhythm, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph shavings as emotional archive transforms preservation trope; risk in dead-language barrier heightens stakes organically.</comment>
