<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's contradictory impulses (facts vs. instinct) act in scene through trembling hands on bottles and final trust declaration, earning the renunciation of "confidently uncertain" with visible emotional cost; Sarah applies targeted pressure without overshadowing. Interiority particularized via roadie memories embodied in grille cloth touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from Ming vase doubt to bottle exam, landing Charged Poise closure ("trust what I feel, even if I fail again") with legible emotional cost in the echoing reverb image; orientation anchored by ~50 words, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quarry trailer dust, draft, and grille cloth constrain choices (swaying distraction, emotional insulation) and charge final image (twisting as purpose echo); sensory hierarchy (visual bubbles, tactile weight) reflects Marcus's professional bias, mirroring internal breakage without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust instincts post-failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bottle handling that narrows options between fact-recitation safety and felt truth, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in "even if I fail again," though Sarah's entry borders convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (purpose beyond applause/facts) emerges organically from grille cloth motif shifting to sustaining reverb, offering non-literal resonant answer in final image without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (vibration/feedback metaphors); dialogue natural/subtextual (Sarah's impatience pursues goal, Marcus's honesty reveals), distinct voices; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to decisive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "insulating emotionally with facts" advances character/prose); varied rhythm, no loops, but minor register elevation in "crazing, convincing patina" verges academic for Marcus; closure image propels cleanly.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie instincts to appraiser doubt transformed via tactile bottles and grille cloth reprise; risk in quiet, image-driven closure heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
