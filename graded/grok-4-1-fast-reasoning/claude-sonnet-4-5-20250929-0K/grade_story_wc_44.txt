<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as rune scholar intensifies through pattern-tracing to compel key insertion and adjustments, with embodied tremble revealing pressure without therapy-speak. Interiority concrete and particular, actions align to reveal competence balanced by subtle struggle. Earned change at closure via prior causality, but minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: spoon-bend → anomalies → key discovery → journal patterns → orrery activation → dawn/noon revelation (DC/CR). Orientation anchored early ("observatory hung suspended... Mira adjusted"). Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "key grew hot... purpose fulfilled," reconfiguring reality's loops.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective via scholar's eye: brass telescope, orrery keyhole constrain choices, perpetual night pressures nocturnal study. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (runic warmth, stuttering gears). Floating isle and dome evolve causally to charge final dawn bleed, mirroring internal awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' noon fate) signaled early, tightens causally at "gaps... incomplete loop" realization narrowing to orrery adjustments. Protagonist agency drives reversal with felt tremble/cost; noon transformation forecloses prior fractured state under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of relearning via closed loops emerges organically from journal patterns to luminous web image, reweighting shadows' "sealed awakening" without statement. Final "shadows... vast web of relationship" offers non-literal resonant answer with lingering ambiguity on transcendence cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: deliberate rune-noticing ("runic inscriptions... fragment of larger mechanism"). Prose texture distinct in syntax/rhythm, modulating intensity at "hand trembled... inserted the key." No head-hopping or withholding; inference matches scholar confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short punchy sentences at stutter: "shuddered to life, but... wrong—incomplete"). Propulsion clear, specificity replaces generics (e.g., "luminous threads that connected every object"). Closure image unflawed, read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bend warps geometry → rune loops relearn shadows' web-truth, transforming fantasy tropes via grounded scholarship. Risky conceptual closure inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes, bold premise fully committed.</comment>
