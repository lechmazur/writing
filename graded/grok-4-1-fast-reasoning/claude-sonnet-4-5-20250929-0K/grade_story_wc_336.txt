<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wise pruner's interiority embodied in bone-felt timing and coaxing song against resistance; final planting earned by blood sacrifice and exhaustion, revealing value hierarchy. Minor telling of "insatiably creative" slightly undercuts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: blood triggers shimmer, essence resists then flows to seed under song, snapping worlds with exhaustion cost. Closure as Charged Poise in glowing seed and planting reconfigures wonder's fate legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and mist-fed orchards constrain planting site and ritual; waterfall roar softens/whispers mirrors veil thinning. Knife and seed as micro-settings sharpen blood moment and final press into soil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve fading wonder tightens accumulatively as essence resists, narrows via coaxing song trading energy for flow. Agency in gathering forecloses loss with bodily cost (gasping, aching knees).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Preservation theme emerges from golden-green light harvest and seed vessel, reweighted in final radiant planting without statement. Complexity in wild essence's resistance yields resonant non-literal answer on wonder's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (colors sing, light flickers) modulates from hush to roar snap; stable close third-person biases to pruner's creative lens. Rhythmic prose heightens ritual pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (seed "drinks" light like roots water); varied rhythm propels from dawn hush to triumphant gasp. No loops or muddled metaphors; peak "worlds snapped" clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-weaving folklore into botanical essence-preservation; risk in consciousness-split pays off in charged seed climax. Inevitable hindsight from cliff orchards to wonder-fruit vision.</comment>
