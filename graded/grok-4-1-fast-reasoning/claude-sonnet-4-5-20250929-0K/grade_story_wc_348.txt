<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via polymer/symphonic lens on foam and paths; contradictory impulses peak in frozen hands yielding to multi-path scattering with visible cost of prior isolation. Final renunciation of withdrawal earned by causal buildup of observations. No unearned epiphanies; blind spots in grief drive the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of foam, chrysalis, paths builds to CR closure in scattering and humming, reweighting grief with undeniable cost of foreclosed connections. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent with one tightening insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine and foam patterns constrain scattering choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy via POV (rapids' structure over chaos) mirrors symphonic perception. Chrysalis as micro-object evolves to anchor metamorphosis motif without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-fueled isolation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via foam insight narrowing to renunciation; agency in portioned ashes forecloses single-path regret with felt relational cost. One decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of divergence-as-connection emerges organically from foam/paths/polymers; final multi-path scattering offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Earned through particulars, ambiguity in grief's flow lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with symphonic/chemical perceptual signature biasing notice of patterns; rhythmic prose modulates from rigid to flowing without filter excess. Voice reflects loosening grief authentically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; varied syntax propels from stasis to release, with foam description weaving action/thought seamlessly. No overwriting; closure image crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chains, foam turbulence, chrysalis into grief's symphony transforms mourning trope; risk in lyric insight structure heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable perceptual angle feels inevitable.</comment>
