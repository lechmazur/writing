<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vendor interaction reveals Mira's motivation and grandmother link with embodied emotion (throat tight), driving micro-choice to buy lens; arc to exhibition earned via revelations, but vendor's wisdom feels slightly instructive over crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market intuition to lens revelations to final compression; Charged Poise closure in girl/grandmother image with conceptual cost of anchoring histories; orientation anchored early in market description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lens fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (transforms market, reveals paintings) and charges final image (rainbows over names); repurposed platforms mirror theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor intuition for histories) signaled early, tightens via lens discoveries narrowing to specific faces; Accumulative deepening reweights with cost in honoring unmourned lives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of between-spaces emerges via layered images (paintings, market, lens), final image non-literally reconfigures translation as eternal honoring; no moralizing, ambiguity in "hovers before settling."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (seeing between); vendor dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythmic modulation peaks in final compression without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "splitting it into impossible colors"); varied rhythm, no loops or artifacts, though "between" recurrence purposeful under lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translation as visual/cultural between-spaces, paintings as hidden maps; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in hindsight-inevitable closure image.</comment>
