<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aria's embodied clarity—"pressed her palm against the cold workbench"—grounds motivation; trembling hands during paste application reveal contradictory fear/drive, earning brother's translucent return as Charged Poise with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through breathing sync to sextant reformation; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the boundary between lost and found crystallized," reweighting fog with undeniable otherworldly cost in brother's translucency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog's "breath-like rhythm" and unmelting frost constrain synchronized method and charge final door-opening; orchard's petrified fruit mirrors dissolving boundaries, evolving to illuminate them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim brother) tightens via reflected plea—"I can't find my way back"—forcing paste commitment; translucent edges viscerally price success under Accumulative cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of "frost-bright lines" non-literally answers boundary-dissolving premise by reweighting it as illuminable; emerges organically from mirror-paste visions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "frost traced elaborate patterns" and rhythmic breathing prose heightens immersion; stable limited POV with purposeful compression pays off in charged reunion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery—"grinding glass powder, mixing it with silver oxide"—propelling to climax; opener's figurative cluster purposeful for tone, no loops obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sextant-mirror synthesis transforms lost-sibling trope via fog-boundary logic; risk-taking in breath-sync ritual feels inevitable, heightening stakes through dream-astronomy fusion.</comment>
