<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's philosophy embodied in net-mending and whisk use reveals contradictory impulses toward tranquility and urgent teaching; girl's arc from shame to intentionality earned via untangling demonstration. Distinct voices in sparse dialogue. Final micro-choice of handing net forecloses her failure path with generational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Kenji's meditation to girl's arrival and mending, culminating in CR closure where her renewed grip reconfigures mistake-as-wisdom with conceptual cost of prior spirals. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph. No slips touch ending image of boats/fireflies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Parapet after rain, fireflies, harbor vividly constrain: wet stone carries whistle, firefly lands on net during pivotal untangling, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (moon paths on water, bamboo friction) POV-specific. Environment mirrors internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden patterns vs. seeing failure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via whisk/net analogy into mending demo that narrows girl's options. Agency in curved untangling forecloses direct fix; cost felt in "ninety-nine attempts not wasted." Minor abstractness in stakes pre-demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges from net tangles, spirals, fireflies; final image of girl mending/boats/fireflies offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting mistakes as generational weave without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gesture; complexity in demure audacity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in curved paths/patterns; diction/rhythm modulate somberly to charged poise at "shared silence." Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (girl's shame prompts teaching). No head-hopping, elisions pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short whistle beats amid longer reflections) propels without loops; metaphors cohere (moon paths, spirals) in peak teaching. "Scintillatingly somber" purposeful, not overwriting. Closure image undulled, precise verbs/nouns throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net philosophy/whisk/moon paths transforms mundane mending into demure audacity; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from firefly geometries to final weave. No derivative echoes.</comment>
