<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mr. Chen's contradictory impulses (work regret vs. family love) act in scene via vinyl clutch and letter-writing choice, earned by Maya's music catalyzing authenticity over perfection; Maya's serene presence reveals hierarchy of values in advising mundane memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from music beat to letter handoff to vinyl reunion; closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in imperfect pieces fitting "not quite...but no longer separate," with death as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hospice's "clouds drifted through open courtyards" and "particular quality of light" constrain choices (gathering for death) and charge final "pulsing stillness" image; recurring cello as micro-setting enables mundane hymning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye via reconciliation) signaled early post-bloodwork, tightens via Maya's agency (music/letter) narrowing to authenticity trade-off; cost legible in Mr. Chen's tears and timed death after reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges organically from pancakes/spatula to vinyl fragments; final "broken pieces...still make music" non-literally reweights perfection premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature ("quality of light that preceded death," "scent...smells like Sunday mornings") biases sensory hierarchy; dialogue subtextual (Mr. Chen's "I don't know how to say goodbye") advances goal amid stable third-limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("scrape of a bow finding its voice" layers rhythm/emotion); no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies to match emotional cadence without figurative muddle in peak reunion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hymning mundane for hospice reconciliation transforms deathbed trope via floating haven and vinyl math; fresh synthesis of music/memory feels inevitable, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
