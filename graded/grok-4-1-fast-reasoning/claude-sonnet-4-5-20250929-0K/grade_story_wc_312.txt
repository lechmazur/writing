<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the reconstruction—"magic guttered and flared, never quite sufficient"—earning the final endurance of strengthened devotion with exhaustion as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of drop patterns and bell work builds to on-page RR closure when "dripping water reversed direction," reconfiguring balance with legible cost in Emris's exhaustion; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's crystalline surface and dripping rates constrain choices throughout, charging the final image of the bell hung at "center span"; selective sensory details (light on barnacles, mist colors) filter through Emris's noticing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic rebalance) signaled early tightens via protagonist's delicate rebuilding under lukewarm limits, forcing trade-off in magic pulses; agency culminates in bell strike with visible cost charging the yielding ocean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of devotion substituting talent emerges organically from particulars like drop counts and fishing hooks; final shadow on "sapphire stone" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting lukewarm magic's value without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("seven drops per minute"); rhythmic prose modulates from observation to intensity in reconstruction, prose as character reflecting analytical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via integrated specifics like "melted-down fishing hooks"; varied rhythm peaks crisply at "sound rippled... fine mist," zero loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lukewarm observation rebalancing cosmic debt via leaky viaduct and broken bell transforms mage tropes; risk in quiet, pattern-driven hero pays off in inevitable hindsight at bell's ring.</comment>
