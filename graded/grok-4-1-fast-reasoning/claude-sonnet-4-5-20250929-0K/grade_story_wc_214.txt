<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like mop circles matching galaxy spirals and logging "Beautiful. Necessary. Brief enough to matter.," earning endurance of isolation as strength. Minor diagnostic phrasing in "flourishing stillness" slightly abstracts conflict without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via meteor observations/cleaning pattern to Charged Poise closure in final image of universe "fall[ing] upward into light," reweighting surrender with legible cost of past self's shadow. Orientation anchored immediately in station/Belt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting constrains choices (polished daily, lit for shower) and charges final flicker/image, with selective sensory details like amber glow merging silver streaks filtered through Kael's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vulnerability-as-strength signaled early tightens accumulatively via shower density and personal log, forcing stance crystallization in mop-setdown/acceptance; cost felt in shadow of armored past self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender's power emerges organically from meteor empathy and cleaning, resonant in final "falling was just another form of flying" without moralizing; log entry borders on-nose but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (meteors as "small deaths burning bright") and rhythmic modulation under meditative pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via spirals/mop imagery, but minor overwriting in dense metaphors like "permeable, present, powerful" risks coherence in reflective peaks without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor in derelict station empathizing with meteors transforms isolation trope; lantern glass/meteor reprise feels inevitable, risking bold lyric stasis over plot.</comment>
