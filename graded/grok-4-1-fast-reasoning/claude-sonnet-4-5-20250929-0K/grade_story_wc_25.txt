<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's traits like gait recognition and map-folding compel higher-stakes listening over action, shown in the tapping rhythm climax; woman applies precise pressure as gatekeeper. Minor flaw in unembodied "understanding flooding through him" at epiphany, but prior micro-choices earn the inner-circle shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (sounds, creases, storm) builds to CR closure in maps room, reweighting labyrinth from maze to whisper-language with conceptual cost of old worker identity foreclosed; coin-to-key tap decisive on-page. Orientation anchors instantly in Port Cervantes/port chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm-amplified sounds and shifting hydraulics constrain choices like pausing to map echoes, charging final aurora-lit maps room; sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) mirrors Marcus's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to pass zodiac challenge signaled early, tightens accumulatively via footsteps opposition and rhythm-tap reversal narrowing escape/hunt options; agency in unconventional coin use forces trade-off with visible acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening/patterns over force emerges organically from creases/echoes/whispers, resonant CR in "hear the path... hidden in whispers" reweighting premise without moralizing. Final handshake image non-literal answer to chaos-mastery question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature ("whispers travel farther"); woman's dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("You proved it"), distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Hydraulic groans filled the air as entire walls..."); varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with storm escalation, no loops or artifacts dulling coin-tap peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shipping-container labyrinth + geomagnetic chaos + auditory creases transforms maze trope; rhythm-tap ingenuity inevitable from established patterns, risks bold sound-navigation payoff.</comment>
