<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's accumulated grief and noticing compulsion create contradictory impulses, embodied in her journal and hesitant bread-sharing; final renunciation of pure documentation earned by dialogue pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with early orientation via courtyard push-through; CR closure in "understanding blooming like the guerrilla gardens" reconfigures loss with conceptual cost of transformed memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges via bread's impossible steam and glowing crust, offering non-literal answer to "what's the point of noticing" in seed-pocketing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature via "deliberate disorder" noticing; dialogue idioms distinct—Mira's grief-tinged questions vs. old woman's measured wisdom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>City-erasure premise ingeniously synthesizes creeping normality into guerrilla absolution; risk of quiet CR pays off in irreplaceable seed-monument synthesis.</comment>
