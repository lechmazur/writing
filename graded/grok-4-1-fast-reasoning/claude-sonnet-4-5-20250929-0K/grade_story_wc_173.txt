<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in suppressed voice, with contradictory fear/triumph embodied in trembling fingers and final laugh; micro-choices like precise untangling reveal values under pressure. Final liberator stance earned by prior causality. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("imprisoned in beauty's cage") slightly generic but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes/threads builds to pattern break at "final thread" pull, yielding on-page Decisive Change (sanctuary explodes into singing shards) with felt cost (imminent guards, shattered illusion). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Closure image reconfigures serenity with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (snow swirling to heartbeat, threads of golden light); courtyard/prism constrain choices via precision risk and winter cold on kneeling body. Prism charges final image as exploding shards. POV-filtered through Celestine's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy conformity/free voices) signaled early, escalates via lens-driven density increase (echoes louder, faster untangling) narrowing options to collapse risk; agency in untangling forecloses obedience path. Cost legible in "one wrong pull" threat and guard arrival. Climax tightening charges ending without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of authentic noise vs. enforced silence emerges organically from echoes/threads/symphony; final conducting image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting prior suppression without moralizing. Complexity in complicit muting lingers plausibly. No thematic echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature ("silk robes whispering secrets"); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity (whispering to exploding shards). No head-hopping; diction controlled and biased to bodily grace. Minor elevated register fits courtesan idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, with varied rhythm supporting build; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (web/tapestry/threads). Minor overwriting in opening ("diamonds," "poetic grace") but woven into action; no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-liberator via echo-harvest web transforms trope; prism/threads premise ingenious, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening rebellion stakes. Final shards feel inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
