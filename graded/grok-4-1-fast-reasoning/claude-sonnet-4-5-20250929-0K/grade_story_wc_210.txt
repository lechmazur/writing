<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with motivation rooted in rejection of illusion intensifying to compel revival choices; contradictory impulses (memory reconstruction vs. real ruins) act in nightly work, earning closure renunciation of opening the bottle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via nightly bottle visions tightening to Charged Poise closure; CR in final bottle image reconfigures wishes-as-parasites premise with conceptual cost of sealed potential, legible in "She never found a way to open it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (torn rice paper "fluttering like the breathing of something long dead") filter through alchemist's bias, constraining reconstruction from ruins; lanterns recur to charge final image of honest revival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest revival vs. illusions) signaled early, accumulates pressure through bottle catalysis narrowing to endurance of sealed vessel; agency in memory-work forecloses easy pouring with felt cost in "stubborn refusal to accept comfortable endings."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of honest alchemy emerges organically from particulars like unopenable bottle as mirror; final image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of "dreams that only closed vessels can contain."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with alchemical perceptual signature ("blueprints, she realized, or memories of blueprints"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to charged in closing lines, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful and coherent (liquid "pulsing like a heart") integrates into action without overwriting peak conception beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical revival via unopenable bottle refracting failed wishes into honest potential; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of memory-as-crucible without gimmickry.</comment>
