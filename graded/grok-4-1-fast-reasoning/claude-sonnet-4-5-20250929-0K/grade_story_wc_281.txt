<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chen's affectionate skepticism shines in his warm doubt and shared understanding, pressuring Mara's resolve; her embodied interiority (phantom light trails, geode grounding) reveals contradictory impulses of loss and purpose. Micro-choices like tracing patterns earn her endurance. Minor reflection summaries slightly dilute peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of perceived pathways builds to Charged Poise closure where hope crystallizes with cost of her blurred self. Orientation anchored early in studio post-shock. One tightening via Chen's gasp narrows to tangled confluence, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio's darkness, crystalline photos, and camera rig constrain choreography; geode sliver as micro-setting grounds spiraling awareness and charges final warming image. Sensory hierarchy (glow trails, cool edges) reflects Mara's altered perception. No white-room; details evolve purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map pathways to save 800) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via demonstration revealing tangle, forcing stance toward "start tomorrow." Agency in luminous choreography forecloses isolation path with felt cost of permanent change. Stakes viscerally embodied in drowning minds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of layered sovereignty emerges organically via geode, light fractals shifting from tangle to mappable routes; final crystallization offers resonant non-literal answer to connection's cost. Subtext in gestures and implications avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers in her rewired sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (neural highways as light paintings); dialogue natural, subtext-laden (Chen's hope), distinct voices. Rhythmic control modulates from doubt to possibility without head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent (fractal trees/rivers) enhance without muddling closure. Propulsion aligns with beats; specificity (muscovite layers) replaces generics. Clean mechanics, purposeful poetic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting, telepathy residue, static fusion transforms tropes into inevitable mapping revelation; geode's mica lore risks bold integration, heightening stakes via thought sovereignty. Non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
