<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly embodied in scar-picking and palm-pressing on table, earning final justice shift; interiority particular via plant-thoughts and wound-layers without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density to CR closure (Dr. Venn vision, blood on hourglass); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "blood christen its frozen surface."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tower/plants/table constrain choices (roses guide, table remembers), charge final image; sensory details (ivy pressing thoughts, dawn light on wrist) POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sister's truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via plant/table memories narrowing to Venn implication; agency in tunneling/listening forecloses closure-only path with wound cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of layered wounds/memories emerges via scars/plants/coffee rings, resonant CR in final blood-hourglass image reweighting absence to justice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (green patient thoughts, circular patterns); rhythmic prose modulates introspection to charged poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (coffee sedimentary layers); no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in "there it was, finally: Dr. Venn... dragging."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-telepathy, scar-reading, frozen-time hush transforms witness trope; risk in memory-tunneling inevitability charges closure organically.</comment>
