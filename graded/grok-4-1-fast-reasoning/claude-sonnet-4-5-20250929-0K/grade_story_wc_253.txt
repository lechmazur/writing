<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's narration embodies internal conflict between resistance and survival, with contradictory impulses peaking in the hand-reaching beat; Emma's mask crack forces relational choice with earned cost. Minor therapy-speak in the "cultivating lightness" epiphany slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via emotional density build from narrated tasks to raw whisper; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "abandoning the performance" with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in farmhouse/turbines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines and dried flowers recur to constrain narration and charge final image ("gray and fragile and honest"); selective sensory details (brittle stems clicking) mirror internal hush without tourist catalog. Environment subtly tensions emotional void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking remade hush) signaled early via narration; textural escalation tightens in Emma's "I remember" and tears, narrowing options with relational cost legible in mask-crack reversal. Agency in persisting/dropping narration forecloses performative path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed grief emerges organically from flowers and narration pattern, resonating in final carving silence without moralizing; "grief needs witnesses" line earns subtext through prior beats. Ambiguity lingers in post-mandate risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Marcus's perceptual signature in theatrical monotone; dialogue natural/subtextual ("I remember") advances pressure. Rhythm modulates from flat narration to broken whisper without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short declarative bursts in peak tears); no loops/artifacts, purposeful "I am" pattern taught early pays off in abandonment. "Wood curls fell like tiny prayers" exemplifies precise, multi-job imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-mandate emotional void and narration resistance transforms dystopian tropes; turbines/grief lightness inflections feel inevitable, risking quiet stasis over confrontation for heightened conceptual cost.</comment>
