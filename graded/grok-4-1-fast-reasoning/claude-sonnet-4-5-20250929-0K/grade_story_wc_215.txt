<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to voice silences intensifies credibly from observation to decisive reading, rooted in her recluse traits and embodied patience. Final commitment as "keeper not of bees, but of what people had been too afraid to say" earns change with felt cost. Mild flaw: minimal contradictory impulses shown in scene, no raw hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery builds to CR closure when ghosts "begin to thin" after reading, reweighting silence premise with conceptual cost of self-imposed prisons. Orientation anchored early in beehives/wasteland. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "wooden frames bleached white" and "stained glass box... catching light like captured honey" filter through Mara's perceptual bias, constraining choice (hive discovery) and charging final image at tree roots. Atmosphere tensions desolation with devotion. Eucalyptus/spring subtly guides ghost gathering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release ghosts via truth) signaled early, tightens at "She knew she shouldn't open it" then ghosts circle, forcing reading agency. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density of silent gestures peaks in dissipation with legible cost of added haunting averted. One deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence poisoning harmony emerges implicitly via ghosts' "pantomimed speeches" and letter's release, resonating in final "garden of necessary speech" without moralizing. Subtext in box's "trembling emotion" craftsmanship reweights covenant's lie. Counter-reading (unity over honesty) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable, perceptual signature in "reading the stories written in dust patterns" biases noticing. Voice texture modulates from tranquil description to charged dusk scene, rhythmic control heightens release without elision. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines like "mouths moving in urgent silence, hands gesturing toward the box" advance character/atmosphere triple-duty. Varied rhythm flows read-aloud; purposeful "unspoken words" recurrence patterns without loops. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts as literalized silences in beekeeping wasteland transforms tropes organically, with box/stained glass inflecting devotion. Risky lyric CR ("mute eloquence") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
