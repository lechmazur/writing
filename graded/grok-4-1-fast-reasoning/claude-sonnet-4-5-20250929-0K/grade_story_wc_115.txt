<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's skepticism and pattern-mapping motive drive consistent micro-choices like photographing and turning wheels, with embodied "drowsy alertness" under pressure; credible endurance to complete documentation shows change with cost. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: radio calls, wheels, and shadows build density to CR closure when final wheel-turn lightens shadows with persistent cost (shift continues sans direct confession). Orientation anchors early; one tightening via confession-hush pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's dripping darkness, rotting ties, and beaded wheels constrain choices (wheels as markers) and charge final image (pipes rush, shadows lift); sensory hierarchy (sounds over sight in hush) reflects urgency and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode ghost shift's truth-weight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via calls/wheels/sounds narrowing to release-attempt; agency in turns forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost legible in eternal persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of confession-lightening guilt emerges organically via calls, beads-as-prayers, shadows; final image resonant CR reweights premise (impressions, not ghosts) without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on full release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with skeptical perceptual signature (patterns in confessions, beads); radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advances plot; rhythmic modulation fits drowsy alertness without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via integrated sensory/action; purposeful "weight" recurrence charges theme without loops; minor elevated diction ("drowsy alertness" repeats) fits voice but caps at high-8s.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio psychics + beaded valves transform ghost trope into guilt-impressions mapped architecturally; risk of accumulative quiet ending heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
