<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (wistful ritual vs. desperate splicing) act in scene, earning the final reunion choice with visible cost of twenty years' endurance. Interiority concrete via clock-winding and film-splicing micro-choices. No safety-hedging; flaws (longing as blindness) drive the bend-time gamble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rituals and images builds to cadence shift where splicing synchronizes compasses, delivering on-page RR (clock reverses, husband arrives) with felt cost of temporal displacement voiced in "I followed it home." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass-floor clouds and flickering compasses constrain choices (triangulate time) and charge final image (stars reflected beneath feet). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: pianist notices keys/cracks, film frames amid urgency. Setting evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite via time-bend) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via splicing density into purposeful compass pulse, narrowing to clock reversal with legible cost (rough voice of displacement). Protagonist agency drives; one tightening sufficient. No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creative longing reweighting time emerges organically from clock, compasses, spliced frames; final image ("play a song about arrival") offers non-literal resonant answer, recharging motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers in "older but unmistakable" reunion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature musical/temporal ("fingers danced across broken keys"). Rhythm modulates with intensity; minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("I heard music... I followed it home"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images ("compasses pulsing in rhythm") advance without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative language purposeful (clouds "churned violently"), no muddle in peak splicing/climax beats. Minor register elevation fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: splicing personal artifacts into film frames hacks liminal-station time via compasses, transforming tropes with bold, inevitable ingenuity. Risky conceptual integrity (temporal shell cracked) heightens stakes, no hedging.</comment>
