<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between compassion and self-respect act vividly in the thermometer moment and journal retrieval, earning the honest reconstruction choice with clear cost to prior reputation. Interiority is concrete and embodied through hands steady on terrarium fragments. No therapy-speak flattens crisis; flaws drive inevitable fraud admission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations of chameleon shedding and mist accumulate density to Charged Poise closure in "We'll try again... Honestly this time," reconfiguring options with felt cost of pretense-shedding. Orientation anchors firmly by para 2 (workshop, post-exposure Elena). One tightening via shed skin notice suffices; cost legible in new document title.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars constrains solitary reflection and charges final image ("starlight broke through in fragments"), mirroring internal shedding. Sensory hierarchy (lantern on chameleon eye, mist curls) reflects Elena's priorities without catalog. Chameleon enclosure as micro-setting evolves causally, guiding journal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance self-respect/compassion post-fraud) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via chameleon parallel into agency-driven pivot to qualitative study, foreclosing fabricated data path. Cost unmistakable in admitting "methodology was flawed" and open submission risk. One tightening at shed skin observation narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of observational truth over stats emerges organically from chameleon regeneration parallel, reweighting premise in final typing image without moralizing. Subtext in mist's "obscuring and revealing" charges quiet resonance. Protagonist arc inextricable from shedding pretense for genuine work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature in selective noticing (chameleon eye "gold-green," mist "shimmering stillness"). Rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure; whispers natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or elision; diction biased to Elena's gentle observer lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "translucent skin lay crumpled... like discarded certainty" advances image/character/theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Zero loops or scaffolds; purposeful "shedding" motif taught early without muddle. Closure image crystalline, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific fraud/redemption through chameleon regeneration turns trope via qualitative pivot and mist parallelism. Quiet ending risks bold Charged Poise, heightening stakes organically. Non-obvious: field notes' "quietly vivid" detail transforms academia's rule-set.</comment>
