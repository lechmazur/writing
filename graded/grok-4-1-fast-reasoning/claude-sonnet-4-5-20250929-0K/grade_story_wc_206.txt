<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aldric's expertise and micro-choices (e.g., rejecting stone removal for completion) root motivation deeply, with embodied reactions like sharp intake of breath; internal conflict emerges in weighing transmutation risks, though contradictory impulses act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via discovery (fragment) therefore decision (complete transmutation), culminating in DC closure as stone shifts "crimson to gold... clear brightness" with felt precision cost; orientation anchors early in chamber descent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains climax choice by amplifying interference patterns for unraveling; forget-me-not as micro-setting charges diagnosis ("drooped as music played") and verifies closure bloom; sensory details selective via tinker's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse joy-theft) tightens causally when "covenant would remain" forces transmutation trade-off, narrowing options with agency in tool deployment; cost legible in "carefully" risked corrosion spread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of small magics reclaiming intangible light emerges via stone's shift and flower's revival, reweighting premise organically; final "echoes... sing" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mechanical precision ("pins aligned, cylinder balanced"); lyrical diction modulates tension effectively, apt for fantasy craft without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax mirroring tinkering pace; dense but coherent metaphors (e.g., "sound folded back upon itself") integrate without muddle in climax; minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but supports atmospheric propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious premise synthesizes music repair with alchemical "covenant of rust" for fresh light-theft angle; risk in alchemical rules pays off inevitably at stone's transformation, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
