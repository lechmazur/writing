<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradictions ("angry and still, wounded and healing") embodied in storm parallels; motivation to map scars compels endurance, earned via timer cycles without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through vigil cycles to Charged Poise closure ("still witness"); cost legible in "turning silence itself into testimony," reconfiguring censorship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory altitude constrains word purity ("essential as oxygen"); storm lightning charges writing and final image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (thunder hums walls).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poetic resistance) deepens accumulatively to stance crystallization; agency in disciplined writing/envelope forecloses open defiance with societal cost felt in whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of scars as landmarks emerges via concrete images (canyons of grief); final archive reconfiguration answers resistance question non-literally, lingering ambiguity in "conspiracy of whispers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (storm as "fierce illumination") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in charged poise, stable close third-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful timer-cycle rhythm; minor paraphrase loop in "twenty minutes" repetition taught early as pattern, metaphors coherent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet's high-altitude vigil transforms resistance trope; storm-observatory frame risks bold lyricism, inevitable in hindsight via scars cartography.</comment>
