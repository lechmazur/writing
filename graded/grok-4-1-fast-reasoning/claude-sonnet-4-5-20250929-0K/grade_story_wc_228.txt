<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (aloof detachment vs. buried promise) act vividly in the cave painting frustration, earning the final presence-shift with embodied cost in cramped fingers and abandoned easel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirror crack seeds pattern break via wrong turn to cave, tightening to shells' fractured whole; closure as CR in "painted seashells whispered what she'd finally learned," reweighting premise with legible cost of risked impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave's shafts, turquoise pools, and tide constrain painting (light shifts resist canvas) and charge final shell distribution; recurring barnacled stones and bleached shells filter through painterly bias, mirroring internal break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paint what matters) signaled early via promise; meaningful deepening when cave "resisted representation," forcing shell pivot that narrows safe observation, with felt cost in unguarded awe and quay forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of presence over distance emerges via mirror-shell motif shift; final image of redistributed shells offers non-literal answer to "temporary eternity," recharging particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third with painterly perceptual signature ("impossible geometry of light"); rhythmic control heightens awe in cave, modulating seamlessly to quiet closure realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; varied syntax propels from quay detachment to cave immersion, vivid images like "shafts of light pierced through fissures" clear and purposeful sans overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh shell-painting synthesis transforms aloof artist trope; wrong-turn cave and fractured mirror honesty feel inevitable, with risk of impermanent art heightening stakes organically.</comment>
