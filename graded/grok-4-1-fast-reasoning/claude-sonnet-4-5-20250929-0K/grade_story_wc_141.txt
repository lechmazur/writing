<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's skeptical shell-listening yielding to cello-playing despite her myth-busting traits; final realization earned via heartbeat sync with shell/cello, embodying internal conflict without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonant hums build density to Conceptual Repricing closure—Mira's bow-lift and imperfect note reconfigure premise with emotional cost legible in "smiled through her tears."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring shell and half-finished cello as micro-settings constrain choices (vibration sync) and charge final image; observatory's cracked dome and ocean crash mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/prove wrong) deepens via cello-note triggering voices, narrowing to connection over proof; agency in repeated bowing forecloses skepticism with felt emotional price in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "space between" emerges organically from resonance fragments; final bow-note offers non-literal answer reweighting science/faith binary, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature shifting from analytical ("nonsense") to synesthetic ("threads"); rhythmic control heightens under pressure, voices natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from setup to closure; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "visible threads" enhance without muddling peak cello beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist twist on myth-busting via acoustic "compass" transforms folklore tropes; risk in quiet CR pays off through shell/cello specificity.</comment>
