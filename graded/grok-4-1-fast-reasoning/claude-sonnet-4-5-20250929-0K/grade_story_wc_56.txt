<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between logic and intuition act in scene ("Logic was a tool that worked until it didn't"), earning final realization with reframed past costs; Mira's flaws in persistence drive competent struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ripple to blueprints, landing CR closure ("She had been looking for monuments when she should have been studying voids") with legible conceptual cost in hindsight reframing; orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Twilight canal and sundial constrain choices (angle catches twilight, water glows/resists shallowness) and charge final image of returning darkness; sensory selection (warm brass, crystalline blue) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of legend-chasing tightens via glow intensification and blueprint emergence under Accumulative lens, forcing tactic shift to salvage with felt cost in "serene upheaval"; agency in rotation/salvage forecloses prior search path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of voids/presence emerges organically from canal frames and negative spaces, with final image ("secrets it held beneath its thoughtfully clear surface") offering resonant CR reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (architectural diagrams in water, intuition over logic); rhythmic diction modulates from calm observation to revelation density, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; minor reflective telling ("Viktor's genius lay not in what he built") anchors to present cues without dragging closure image of fading glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of negative architecture and twilight misdirection transforms legend-seeking trope; risk in conceptual CR (stepping sideways into voids) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
