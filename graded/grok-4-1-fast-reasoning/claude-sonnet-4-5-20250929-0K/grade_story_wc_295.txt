<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in exhaustion and isolation, with micro-choices like sharing journals forcing relational shift; contradictory impulses in solo burden vs. shared work act in scene. Earned change via Elias's involvement forecloses solitary path with Ashwin's cost felt. Minor epiphany phrasing borders tidy ("understanding dawned like sunrise") without full embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from inscriptions to star matches, culminating in Charged Poise closure as they write together under pulsing stars. On-page cost legible in "Ashwin's final lesson understood at last," reconfiguring isolation. Single scene anchors orientation early (dome opening); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory dome and brass telescope constrain choices (night observation, tablet journals); recurring stars charge final image, mirroring internal states via pulsing rhythms. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Mara's trembling on cold metal, Elias's catalogs). Environment evolves with dawn, guiding companionship.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode temporal stars for healing) signaled early, tightens via Delta Cephei match narrowing solo obsession to shared method. Agency in collaborative work forecloses isolation with relational cost. Escalation accumulative, one deepening suffices; minor abstractness in stakes ("collective trauma") slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges via particulars (priests' ceremonies, Ashwin's telegram), reweighted in final writing image without statement. Subtext in silences (Elias's "own weight"); resonant non-literal answer: stars "pulse in patterns meant to be read together." No moralizing, complexity in isolation's cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Mara's perceptual bias on dreams/stars); distinct texture in rhythmic prose ("pulsed their ancient rhythms"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Show me" reveals Elias's burden), advances plot. Minor register elevation in descriptions fits poetic voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short peak sentences in revelations); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful ("stars as lighthouse"), integrated into action. Slight overwriting in opening ("eye at midnight") but peaks clean; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable stars as temporal/shared healing code transforms isolation trope organically. Risky lyric-accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry; final reconfiguration ("nothing changes alone") inevitable from priors. No derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
