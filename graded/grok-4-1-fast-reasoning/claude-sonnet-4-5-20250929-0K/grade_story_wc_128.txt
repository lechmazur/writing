<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marianne's shrewdness roots motivation and expands credibly through micro-choices like bringing the envelope and photographing the lighthouse keeper; internal shift feels embodied in "something shift in her chest." Chen's whimsy particularized via shelving books "as if children," applying pressure via invitation. Minor summary in weeks-later project dilutes one beat but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recognition density builds from envelope return to shared project and lighthouse anecdote, culminating in CR closure ("currency of gratitude") with felt cost in value reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early via staircase and library dome. Time jump legible but summary-heavy, softening one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome stars and harbor breeze selectively filter through Marianne's broker lens, mirroring logistics parallels and charging final image ("stars wheeled... ripple outward"). Sensory hierarchy urgent post-symphony, subtler in reflection. Dome subtly guides display placement and cosmic witness role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplift silent contributors) signaled early, tightens via lighthouse keeper's tears changing Marianne's tactics to documentation; agency in initiating project forecloses isolated shrewdness with relational cost. Accumulative deepening reweights via cycle pattern. Stakes felt but abstract at times, no live option fully tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from dock workers parallel and library display, resonating in final ripple image without moralizing. Lighthouse keeper whisper ("lighthouse just runs itself") subtextually layers theme. Counter-reading (glory vs. shadows) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with broker-biased noticing (e.g., "ledgers and manifests"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("silent contributors"). Rhythmic prose modulates from cautious to charged. Minor filter verbs in reflection but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels via image integration ("starlight pooled like spilled milk"); high density in key beats. Minor overwriting in final stars image ("ancient patterns, witnesses") borders purple but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cargo logistics as compassion cycles transforms recognition trope; envelope mistake organically seeds ripple premise. Lighthouse keeper anecdote inflects non-obviously from broker worldview.</comment>
