<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's interior contradiction between hollow ghostwriting and seeking pattern acts in scene via throat tightening at the spiral and culminates in earned choice to add her letter with vulnerability cost. Sena applies relevant pressure as catalyst. Flawless embodiment avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to spiral reveal to closure's Charged Poise as Margot ties her letter, reconfiguring her disconnection with legible vulnerability cost in "glowing" paper image. Orientation anchored early in temple/pool. Single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (steam from petals, prismatic light through apertures, silk threads catching light) filters through Margot's pattern-seeking bias and charges final image where her letter "caught the prismatic light and held it, glowing." Setting guides climb and approach. Recurrent light/prism constrains revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disconnection vs. finding pattern) signaled early, deepens via installation recognition tying letters to spiral, narrowing to agency in adding her own with exposure cost. Accumulative lens reweights via density to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in initial hollow feeling pre-tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of secrets as connective threads emerges organically from particulars (photo, flower, letters) to spiral/nest, protagonist arc inextricable; final image of letter glowing in constellation offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (pattern syntax, prismatic motifs); rhythmic prose modulates from whimsical vagueness to charged quiet. Sena's dialogue natural/subtextual, voice-distinct from narration. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid flowing descriptions); purposeful figurative coherence (spirals, threads, light) without muddle or loops. Propulsion peaks clean in closure tying action/image. No scaffolds or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter trope via secret-spiral installation transforms isolation into shared geometry; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration from conduit to participant inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
