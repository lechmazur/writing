<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the moment Marianne wants to "yearn, to grab this possible-daughter" but skeptic training holds, earning the final "Teach me" choice with visible cost of abandoning certainty. Interiority concrete and particular, traits like shrewd innocence revealed through past deception recognition. Flawless under pressure with no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of doubt builds from millpond substitute to tooth recognition to Iris's revelation, landing Charged Poise closure in "Teach me" with conceptual cost of certainty's prison foreclosed. Orientation anchored early in maze walk; no disorientation debt. Cost legible in garden brightening and tooth pulsing as star.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Secret garden constrains entry (only for doubters) and charges final image, with sensory specifics like "roses bloomed in colors that had no names" and "air tasted of copper and honey" filtered through Marianne's priorities. Micro-setting (warm tooth) embodies stakes. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge worlds to retrieve children) signaled early via tooth, tightens through Iris's plea and degrading substitutes, driven by Marianne's agency in skeptical questioning to "Teach me" renunciation of logic. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens coherently with felt cost in foreclosed certainty. One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming fractures into "constellations" emerges organically from bone-setting motif and cleft-living, resonant in final image of tooth as "star being born" reweighting mistakes without moralizing. Subtext in Iris's "you needed certainty then, even false" creates earned irony. Invites ambiguity via forgiving skeptic's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in skeptic's cataloguing ("every reason this couldn't be real"); voice rhythmic and modulated, diction purposeful (e.g., "impossibly wrong for November"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing Iris's ancient eyes from Marianne's doubt; clean free indirect style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The tooth was warm. Alive." advances plot, embodiment, stakes); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, figurative language sparse and purposeful in roses/tooth. Propulsion peaks cleanly at closure without overwriting or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms changeling trope via bone-setting as "reknitting" mistakes into guiding light, with hedge maze/garden risking bold fairy-realm innovation grounded in emotional specificity. Non-obvious angle on doubt as portal heightens stakes organically; no derivative hedging.</comment>
