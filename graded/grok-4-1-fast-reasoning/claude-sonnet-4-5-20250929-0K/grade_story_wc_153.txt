<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Meera's fierce tenderness and recognition of "particular anguish" root her cryptic expertise in consistent traits, compelling the ritual; client's grief feels embodied in trembling hands but borders stock shallowness. Woman's shift—"something in them had shifted"—earned via prior recall, foreclosing trapped regret with felt cost. Minor slip: client's traits shown through action but lack voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from shard-warming to spirits' crescendo, yielding Charged Poise closure in woman's chest-pressing and eye-shift, reconfiguring regret with emotional cost legible in "still grief-stricken, but no longer trapped." Single scene coherent; orientation anchored early in houseboat/mangrove. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove roots "like arthritic fingers" and singing spirits integrate tactilely, constraining ritual via moonlight-filtered canopy and humid air shimmering with harmonies; shard-as-micro-setting charges final healing. Sensory hierarchy reflects Meera's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Evolves causally with moonrise and fading messages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to reclaim the pre-decision moment—tightens accumulatively via letter-reading and condensation messages, narrowing to kitchen recall where "you almost called," forcing renunciation of trapped pride. Agency in woman's reading and shard-pressing forecloses path with visible cost in tears/release. Escalation coherent under lens; cost unmistakable in shifted eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unsent apologies in "liminal space" emerges implicitly from ritual particulars, reweighted in fading window messages and Meera's reflection on "apologies waiting... between pride and love." Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Counter-readings linger in persistent grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cryptic layers ("meanings within meanings") and biased noticing of grief-hollowed faces; rhythmic prose modulates from cryptic to tender. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual—"I can't bring her back"—pursues goals. No head-hopping; diction fits mystic idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene—short crescendo sentences for spirits, breathing paragraphs for closure; high density in "symbols that would evoke what needed to surface." No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; propulsion peaks in backwards script emergence. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms medium trope via timeline-healing over ghost-contact, synthesizing shard's tear-history with mangrove mysticism into inevitable ritual; fresh "gargoyle's rainspout shard" inflection risks bold lyricism heightening stakes. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity in regret-repricing.</comment>
