<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation intensifies compellingly from suspicion of diviners to cutting the heart, rooted in grandmother's hollow facts; contradictory impulses act in studying patterns then adapting flowers. Final entry earned by prior causality with her absence as cost. Internal voice particular without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from docks to heart, patterns teach revelation, CR closure in crystallization reconfigures absences with legible cost ("diviners would... find only her absence"). One tightening via flowers suffices; orientation anchored early at whale beaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: gravity pockets force careful steps ("judge each step"), chambers' brine bites during wade, heart pulls/pushes. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (maintenance tunnels, dissolved minerals). Mirrors inconstancy to internal gaps purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, deepens via flowers pointing to heart under lens; agency in cutting/gathering forecloses normal life with transformation cost. Escalation coherent as pressure narrows to entry, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of conserved absences emerges organically from whale's gaps, flower patterns, crystal memories; final image ("lighting lanterns beside her grandmother") resonates non-literally, reweighting deletions without moral. Complexity in diviners' misread vs her truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias (patterns over coffee grounds); voice texture distinct in syntax/rhythm, modulates to charged poise at "heart close around her." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, integrate action/atmosphere (e.g., "waded into the pool, gasoline-slick"); zero loops, clean syntax, purposeful figurative ("crystallized moments") without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale-as-memory-vessel, gravity absences, salt crystals transforms tropes organically; risk in surreal logic pays off at CR closure, feels inevitable from early pockets.</comment>
