<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's guarded nature and warlike serenity drive consistent choices, like shifting from comforting song to war-song upon seed discovery, earning the apprentice's release with her unflinching precision. Interiority is embodied via staff arcs and singing under vortex resistance, revealing value hierarchy without stock phrasing. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers score, but final endurance forecloses gentle illusions with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: search circles lead to frozen apprentice because/therefore seeds reveal forbidden intent, shifting tactics to war-song for decisive crack and release. Orientation anchors immediately in orchard vortex post-festival rift. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in Maren's final line and slowing spiral reconfigures "lost things" premise with undeniable conceptual cost of self-imposed rigidity, cost legible in sinking seeds and apprentice's trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "screaming wind through skeletal branches" and "mirror-bright pools" filter through Maren's precise reading of curse structure, constraining song choice and charging final slowing vortex image. Micro-setting of staff and pools guides freeing action. Hierarchy narrows to vortex immediacies under pressure, mirroring internal unbending without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free apprentice from soul-reflection curse signaled early, tightens causally via seed realization narrowing gentle song option into war-song trade-off. Escalation forces agency in voice-hammering the scream, with visible cost in tumbling body and raw emergence. Protagonist alteration (song shift) earns resolution; closing orchard slowdown reweights stakes under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-deceptive "false reflections" and refusal to unbend emerges organically from mirror rift, seed lies, and final line realization, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in pouch clutch and sinking seeds invites ambiguity on truth-seeking costs. Final image offers resonant answer via Maren's worldview, inextricable from her arc and apprentice's fall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with Maren's perceptual signature in "reading the curse's structure" and war-serene diction; syntax modulates rhythmically with rising song intensity. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Your own false reflection"), distinguishing voices via apprentice's whisper vs. Maren's hard finish. No head-hopping; distance tightens aptly for freeing climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels causally: "staff cutting precise arcs" integrates action/atmosphere without hedges. Rhythm varies for read-aloud flow, peaking cleanly in scream emergence without figurative muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "expanding circles" method (intro/retrace) dings slightly but doesn't obscure closure; strong verbs dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-soul horror with flesh-seed blood magic transforms rescue trope via unbending war-song and conceptual truth-eating plants. Risky quiet CR closure via guarded aphorism feels inevitable from causal chain, heightening thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
