<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's idealism and dread embody contradictory impulses acting in scene, from pocketing the nail to inviting Kao, earning the closure choice; Dr. Kao applies pressure via mood-reading and joining. Internal conflict surfaces in "spongey dread" amid confidence. Voice distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journal decoding therefore wound-door realization therefore airlock commitment as Charged Poise closure with cost in "strange, singing cold." Orientation anchored early at window/ice shelf. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Violet clouds, upward snow, singing auroras constrain choices via metaphysical weather; copper nail as recurring micro-setting charges final image as "key." Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward maps/weather. Setting guides descent beneath station.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove reversible exile) signaled early, tightens via Kao's skepticism-to-respect shift narrowing options; agency in Mira's invitation forecloses staying with felt risk cost. Escalation causal under lens. Moral calculus in honoring "coward" ancestor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voluntary exile emerges via nail/journals/wound-door particulars, reweighted in final airlock image without moralizing; subtext in Kao's "document this properly." Resonant non-literal answer to permanence via "step sideways."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person Mira with perceptual signature (weather geometries metaphysical); dialogue subtextual (Kao's skepticism shifts), goal-driven, voice-distinct. Rhythmic control modulates dread to poise. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/syntax propel via integrated images ("snow that fell upward"); no loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle. "Nervously confident" purposeful reprise. Clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate sci-fi/arctic lore via "wound-doors" and reversible exile transforms tropes organically; risk in metaphysical geography heightens stakes. Nail/exile logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
