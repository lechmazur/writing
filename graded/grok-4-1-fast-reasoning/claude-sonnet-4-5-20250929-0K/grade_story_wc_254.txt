<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Meris's motivation rooted in "tremor of certainty" compels composing into quartz, earning her stride through boundaries; Kael applies relevant pressure via warning. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting toward reverence without embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from dormant colonnade to pulsing agreement; Charged Poise closure in "poetry began remembering how to breathe again" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of fluid knowledge's permanence vs. future bans. Orientation anchored early in atrium by frozen lake; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, cracked ice, and quartz pillars constrain choices (palm placement amplifies intention) and charge final image of wind-swept patterns mirroring ephemeral poetry. Sensory hierarchy reflects poet's bias toward fleeting beauty; evolves with humming intensification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming fluid poetry signaled early, tightens via Kael dialogue and composition amid ban warning; Accumulative deepening reweights to Charged Poise with felt cost of denial's weight. Agency in renunciation of fixed paraphrase forecloses rigid path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of aesthetic fluidity vs. control emerges via quartz frequencies bypassing language, resonant in final "boundaries once thought sacred were already dissolving" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in wind patterns and Kael's warning invites ambiguity on permanence.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in ephemeral-pattern noticing; poetic diction modulates rhythmically, dialogue subtextual ("Paraphrase would kill it") advances stakes. No head-hopping, voice particular to poet's hushed reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (humming builds texture); varied rhythm, no loops dulling propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "lantern-moth circling flame" purposeful for tone, but elevated diction borders register drift in peak composition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh quantum-poetry premise transformed via quartz amplification and post-ban stakes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens conceptual ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via colonnade's awakening.</comment>
