<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist's contradictory nervousness (backwards walking amid mentoring) and Finn's combative tenderness drive micro-choices like persisting with tea reading despite skepticism; earned shift peaks when Finn copies annotations clumsily. Final admission reveals flaw hierarchy with relational cost. Voice distinction shines in Finn's "garbage" vs. earnest question.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard discovery to tea geometry mirroring Finn's "defensive formations," tightening to charged poise in shared reflection with vulnerability cost ("caught" smile). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure reconfigures exile premise via final image of trapped light and playground ghosts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard and tea leaves as micro-settings constrain lesson choices; library's dust, cracked windows, and echoing footsteps tactilely mirror internal exile, charging final wind-laughter image. Sensory hierarchy (visual ripple in shard, audible hush-as-swing) reflects archivist's perceptual bias. Body habit (backwards walk) evolves with emotional reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mentoring resilience vs. Finn's doubt) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tea revelation narrowing to relational vulnerability; Finn's shard-touch whisper forces archivist's deeper share. Agency in persistence forecloses isolation path with admission cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reversible exile emerges implicitly from texts, tea patterns, shard ripple; final image non-literally answers via "path home in unexpected directions," reweighting brokenness without moral state. Subtext layers in combative dialogue silences. Complexity lingers in archivist's unresolved nervousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable, perceptual signature in backwards-motion metaphors and shadow-light bias. Dialogue subtextual (Finn's insults pursue approval); rhythm modulates from combative snaps to tender hush. Diction purposeful, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "footsteps echoing... swing drifts" advances sound, simile, absence). Varied rhythm breathes with scene; metaphors coherent (geometry clusters void). No loops; opening anchors stakes, final recharges shard motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea geometry, shard shadows, reversible exile transforms mentor-kid exile trope; risk in backwards habit payoff heightens stakes. Non-obvious final reconfiguration (laughter ghosts amid rot) inevitable from particulars.</comment>
