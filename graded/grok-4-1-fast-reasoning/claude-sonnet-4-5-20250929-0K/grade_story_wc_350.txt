<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as librarian drives consistent actions like composing and attaching the weight, rooted in her choral expertise; interiority concrete in sensing vibrations and risking the clock. Minor weakness: internal conflict more summarized than shown in contradictory impulses during the descent/attachment, but closure endurance (watching transformation) feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations build to regulated harmony with one tightening (weight attachment changes grain song cadence). On-page CR closure in final image of swinging weight and planning composition reconfigures isolation with conceptual cost ("risk disharmony to find deeper harmony"). Orientation anchored early in tower climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower dome starlight and silos' ventilation shafts constrain choices (speakers positioned, weight attached to fan); sensory hierarchy favors sound filtered through Mara's ear/training. Recurring starlight charges bookend images, mirroring internal shift from solitude to symphony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge isolation via harmony) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when weight regulates imperfect rhythm, forcing farmers' suspicion-then-joining. Agency in descent/attachment forecloses consensus path with felt risk; cost legible in "suspicious" fields turning to shared songs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-from-isolation emerges via grain voices dialoguing languages, reweighted in final valley symphony without moralizing. Closing lines offer non-literal answer: separate notes as chords, with lingering ambiguity in clock's imprecision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic, auditory noticing ("brass gears whispering," "grain itself singing"). Lyrical diction modulates from hush to vigorous pulse, matching emotional build; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cuckoo clock weight... substantial pull" advances plot/foreshadows); varied rhythm propels via short crescendo sentences at attachment. Minor scaffold in repeated "hush of borrowed starlight" purposeful for bookend resonance, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of singing silos, meteor-iron weight regulating wind-song, and multilingual recordings transforms isolation trope into auditory ecosystem. Risky premise (grain as chorus) commits fully, with weight's swing inevitable in hindsight for communal chords.</comment>
