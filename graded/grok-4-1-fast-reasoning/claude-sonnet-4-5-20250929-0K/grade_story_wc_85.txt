<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's guilt manifests in embodied actions like trembling fingers and sifting driftwood, with internal conflict shown through failed contact attempts; Elias's arrival forces a micro-choice revealing values hierarchy. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak confrontation embodiment, but doesn't unmotivate her renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds via ritual to Elias's confrontation (pattern break), yielding Charged Poise closure—"tear down the careful fabrications"—with legible cost in "destroyed her soul" and final driftwood image reconfiguring options. Orientation anchored early (terrace/shore/dusk); single continuous scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Driftwood shore constrains choices (penance method, sifting ritual shapes confrontation pause); cobalt terrace frames start/end, charging final image. Sensory selection (sand sinking shoes, waves crashing) reflects urgency; no white-room—vivid, POV-filtered integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt/accountability) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual to Elias's arrival forcing stance crystallization; agency in endurance/renunciation ("I can't undo it") with visible cost foreclosing excuses path. One deepening sufficient; cost unmistakable in "years you stole."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth's weight emerges organically from fabrications vs. ritual, culminating in non-literal final image (driftwood "almost beautiful") reweighting lies' cost without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures; ambiguity lingers in her dismantling resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (guilt filters driftwood as hands/screams); dialogue natural/subtextual ("time had stopped," tempered regret mirrors tone). Rhythmic control modulates from reflective to terse confrontation; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short confrontation sentences propel); metaphors purposeful ("driftwood like broken promises") without muddle. Minor scaffold in adjacent reflection paraphrases ("guilt... crystallized"), but no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: black-market genealogy lies + driftwood penance transforms guilt trope via specific "sieved hush" and watch hand; risk in quiet renunciation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
