<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (analytical cataloguing vs. intuitive beauty-seeking) act in scene through sketching cracks; final validation of self-truth earned by prior mapping obsession with visible cost of unmaking rational self-image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as arrow patterns densify to chamber revelation; CR closure lands on-page in "her own name beside a truth she'd been mapping around... without admitting" with conceptual cost of self-reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and cracks constrain choices by forming navigational arrows into tunnel; notebook as recurring micro-object charges final drawing image, filtering through Mara's analytical-artistic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking hidden truths tightens accumulatively via conductor dare and chamber discovery, narrowing rational mapping to include mysteries; agency in "I dare" forecloses denial with self-truth cost legible in final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rational maps vs. unspoken detours emerges organically from crack-arrows and fortress names; final notebook drawing offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "logic and aesthetics intertwined" biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from steady analysis to charged revelation, with dialogue subtext in conductor's warning advancing stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (e.g., "fractal complexity" advances momentum); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figurative like "contract written in starlight" without muddle in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban cartography and psychic fortress transforms phantom conductor trope; risk in fractal arrows leading to self-confession feels inevitable from opening cracks.</comment>
