<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in grandfather's legacy, with embodied emotion in the dive's "cold resistance" and earned reconfiguration of her lamplighter role; contradictory impulses between routine duty and secret quest act on-page, culminating in hanging the key tag with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with density building to the sealed quarters discovery as pattern break and CR closure in the lanterns' reweighting as "musical notes"; orientation anchored early in pier lighting, one tightening via breach entry suffices with felt physical/emotional cost legible throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library barnacles and bioluminescent pulses constrain dive choices and charge final surfacing image; sensory hierarchy (cold shock narrowing to lamp beam) reflects lamplighter bias, with pier-to-water choreography coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fulfill luminous vow tightens via grandfather's hidden bottles, driven by Mara's agency in purposeful dive under lens; escalation coheres accumulatively with physical risk and knowledge shift foreclosing ignorance, cost unmistakable in silent completion amid rising lanterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sensory translation emerges organically from bottles' labels to lanterns' "symphony of light," offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; final image recharges prior lamps and algae particulars, embracing synesthetic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound became visible") modulating rhythmically under dive stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise of resurfacing gaze, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; light/sound imagery coherent and pattern-taught, peaking crisply in "rippling barrier between air and water."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synesthetic dictionary in sunken library transforms legacy trope via algae bottles and low-tide dive; risk-taking in accumulative light motifs heightens closure ingenuity without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
