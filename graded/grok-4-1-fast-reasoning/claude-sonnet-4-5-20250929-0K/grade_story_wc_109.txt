<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oracle's obsession with endings roots her motivation to map silences, shown concretely via backstory anchored to her methods and gentle interruption of commander; internal conflict subtle in her certainty amid catastrophe, with micro-choice to draw defying map in earned change for him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating silences tightening to Charged Poise closure where commander's understanding of absence-map reconfigures navigation; orientation anchored early in arrival at fort; cost legible in "something like navigation began" amid total dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fort's ambered hush and sodden robes constrain choices amid deepening dark; sensory selection (muffled steps, flaking gold) mirrors perceptual narrowing; recurring booklet charges final map image, with weather (rain, storm-redrawn world) evolving to guide silence-landmarks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping endless night signaled early, escalates texturally through three silences narrowing to map-choice; agency in oracle's drawing and commander's acceptance forecloses visual reliance with conceptual cost in dark navigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings via absences emerges organically from silence progression and map of withheld truths; final image of "navigation began" reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity on speaking-again without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization with perceptual signature in textured noticing (e.g., "flaking onto the table like captured sunlight"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing voices; rhythmic control heightens hush under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and integrated sensory image; minor figurative density ("marbled quiet so profound it had texture") purposeful under textural lens, no loops; closure line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle-of-silences and absence-map transforms prophecy trope; risk in defying cartography heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via silence progression.</comment>
