<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to find unused love via film strip compels concrete micro-choices like booth search and box opening; interior visions embody contradictory hesitation of past lovers. Final redistribution renunciation earned with cost of irrecoverable pasts. Archetypal psychic poise limits deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via psychometry vision → targeted search → box/map discovery tightening to CR closure; shimmering map reconfigures unused love with conceptual cost of foreclosed returns. Single scene causality holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Booth's dust motes, brass rail, and rusted box constrain tactile search and charge discoveries; thunder hush filters through POV emotional residue. Light shafts via window project map, mirroring internal states in final rain image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of locating unused love escalates accumulatively through visions revealing booth's purpose, narrowing to realization of no direct return; agency in gathering satchel charges CR with felt opportunity cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unused love as luminous substance emerges organically from visions, letters, and map; final redistribution and lyrics-tune image offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with psychometric perceptual signature (tingling fingers, layered visions); lyrical diction and rhythm modulate hushed tension to flowing release. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High-density lines like "dust motes swirled through shafts of afternoon light" propel via vivid propulsion; varied syntax and clean metaphors avoid artifacts. Closure image rhythm recharges thunder motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, celluloid residues, and tangible unused love yields inevitable map/ redistribution turn; conceptual risk transforms trope into charged CR without gimmick.</comment>
