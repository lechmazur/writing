<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—clinical skepticism versus cracking detachment—act simultaneously during the phone call, earning her final pocketing of the arrowhead with visible cost to her "fortress of skepticism."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of revelations (arrowhead, phone voices, Voss laugh) tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in foreclosed skepticism as she pockets the arrowhead.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underground garden's bioluminescent mushrooms and ghost orchids constrain choices (e.g., phone placement amid terrariums) and charge final impossible bloom, mirroring internal metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exposure versus transformation deepens accumulatively through phone voices forcing stance shift; agency in listening and arrowhead choice forecloses prior path with career cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant harmony emerges organically via shifting images (soil under nails to upward-tugging arrowhead), with final bloom offering non-literal resonant answer to bitterness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases clinically early, modulating to wonder at "what if it's actually beautiful?"; dialogue subtextual, with Old Marrow's idiom distinct and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory details; minor figurative density (e.g., "stories that twisted like smoke") purposeful without muddling peak phone revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravitational playfulness and harmony untamed transforms cryptid tropes through Maya's lived bitterness-to-joke arc; risk in cosmic familiarity (Voss laugh) heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
