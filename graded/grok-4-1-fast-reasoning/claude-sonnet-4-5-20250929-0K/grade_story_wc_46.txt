<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied in polishing motions tied to Elena's memory, revealing contradictory grief and creation impulses; final thumb on amber glass earns stasis with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from polishing to gallery arrangement, yielding Charged Poise closure in mist settling and Elena's shadow-smile with undeniable emotional cost; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's mist-slick walls and light angles constrain precise glass positioning, charging final breathing image; sensory selectivity (roar-whisper balance) mirrors internal transformation without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gentling starlight tightens texturally via memory-interlaced polishing, foreclosing raw grief with endurance cost; children's widening eyes deepen communal pressure legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of broken-to-beautiful emerges organically from glass transformations, resonant non-literal answer in final colored shadows reweighting loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (starlight as paint) biases noticing toward light striations; rhythmic modulation accelerates in memory tide, stable close third-person POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-reflection without loops; varied syntax propels from abrasive wheel to zephyr bloom shift, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of observatory ash to sea-glass cathedral transforms grief tropes through grotto physics; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes in Elena's earned shadow-smile.</comment>
