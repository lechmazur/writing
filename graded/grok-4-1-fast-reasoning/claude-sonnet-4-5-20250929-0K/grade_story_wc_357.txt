<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices under Inversion pressure (correcting pod trajectory, following water) reveal competent traits and pilot interiority; motivation intensifies via warming arrow tip. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery for deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as water cues accumulate to echo revelation and CR closure (cradling sphere reweights resilience); orientation anchored early in pod throttle moment; persistent arrow tip constraint shapes path without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward-arcing water constrain navigation choices during Inversion lurch, charging convergence point; sensory hierarchy (whirling silence to singing stones) reflects pilot urgency and mirrors temporal theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled via arrow tip tightens accumulatively through Inversion-forced water pursuit, narrowing to echo-guided discovery with felt cost in hummed completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges via layered echoes and temporal seeds, reweighted non-literally in final orchards image without moralizing; arrow tip reprise ties motif organically to CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with pilot-specific perceptual signature (water flows as highways, arches singing); rhythmic prose modulates from drifting silence to Inversion tumble without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel Inversion sequence ("world turned inside out"); no loops or artifacts obscure closure image of pulsing sphere and falling leaves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temporal orchards and water-flow method synthesize fresh sci-fi ingenuity; echo technique turn grows inevitably from established cues, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
