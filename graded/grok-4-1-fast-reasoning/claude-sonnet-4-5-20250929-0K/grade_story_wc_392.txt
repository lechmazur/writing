<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory impulses—loyalty to Reeves versus truth-seeking—act simultaneously in her racing thoughts amid steady hands photographing evidence, earning her final radio defiance. Interiority concrete via "fortified vulnerability she'd been building toward for seven years." Micro-choices like uploading to journalists reveal values hierarchy with career cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lantern discovery → symbols → chamber → notes → radio response as Decisive Change, foreclosing compliance path with felt career cost in "silence on the other end stretched long enough that she knew Reeves understood." Orientation anchored by para 1. Single scene tightens meaningfully once.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tunnel's flooded concrete, corroded brass, and ankle-deep "cold but clean" water constrain squeezing through gap and charge final lantern shadows as freedom guide. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: empirical notice of symbols over rushing water. Details evolve causally with discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. control) signaled early via promotion doubts; causal tightening in chamber notes narrows options, forcing agency in encrypted upload before radio trade-off. Cost legible in her "fortified vulnerability" facing Reeves' demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of breaking control emerges via lanterns shifting from artifact to freedom symbol, reweighting drought-exposed corruption in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like carved names mirroring Malcolm's failed escape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elena POV with perceptual signature in empirical scanning ("light caught something else"); radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing pressure. Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via image-integrated action; no loops or artifacts dull closure. Minor register elevation in "reverberate in your skull" fits voice but borders academic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad lanterns in subway graft, transformed via drought-memory entanglement; risk in quiet defiance turn feels inevitable from priors. No close template echoes.</comment>
