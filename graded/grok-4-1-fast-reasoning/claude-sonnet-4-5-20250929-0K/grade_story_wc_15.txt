<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in wharf skills and devotion compels consistent micro-choices like embedding violet silk stones, earning the final departure. Interiority poetic but concrete-particular in "fingers already threading indigo cord," revealing optimistic competence balanced by sleepwalking's uncontrollable pull. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal scene moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through nightly pattern buildup to CR closure: threads mirror plate "perfectly" on new moon, reweighting precedents with conceptual cost of new traditions. Orientation anchored by ~50 words at entrance. One tightening via travelers sensing "grammar of possibility" coheres drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon crevices constrain sewing choices; silk threads evolve from lifeline to luminous network, charging final "rose gold" image. Sensory selective: indigo cord, dawn light on veins. Mirrors internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transform ruin accumulates density via crossing paths; sleepwalking agency tightens to circuit completion, foreclosing isolation with travelers' arrival as deepening. Cost legible in devotion's uncertainty: "couldn't know if anyone would ever follow." Textural escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of repetition as wisdom emerges from sewn overlaps mirroring plate, reweighted in "broken precedents had become new traditions" without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to ruin/reverence question via orchid solace bloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in rhythmic syntax like "silk threads that caught the dawn light like veins of precious metal"; perceptual bias optimistic, selective to glowing possibilities. Stable third-person POV with clean free indirect texture under sleepwalking mystery. Compression taught early, paid off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "sew markers into the canyon walls—silk threads that caught the dawn light like veins" advances action, image, tone). Varied rhythm, no loops; figurative purposeful without muddle in peak "new moon" beat. Minor simile density in week-three passage nudges down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sleep-sewing transforms labyrinth trope via specific wharf-weaver logic and map mirroring; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight from first-night trail to rose-gold closure. Bold risk in somnambulant agency heightens stakes organically.</comment>
