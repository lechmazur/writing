<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to thaw mistrust drives consistent choices like projecting doodles, earning Marco's confession; interiority concrete in boots on pavement but leans summary in "steadfast" traits. Climax confession feels earned via prior investigation without unmotivated leaps. Minor label-speak ("thaw mistrust") abstracts embodied pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ticket examination to doodle projections revealing timeline; RR closure at staff gathering with felt relational cost (dissolved doubt). Orientation anchored early in forecourt; one tightening via Marco's emergence suffices. Lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choices (whispers for eavesdropping, wet surface for projections) and charges final image of harmony; sensory hush/whispers selective via Elara's priorities. Mirrors internal clarity shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clear name via transparency) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through doodle patterns implicating colleague then revealing innocence; agency in arranging projections forecloses suspicion path. Cost legible in Marco's trembling guilt and shared burden lift. Coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Honesty frees emerges organically via lens/doodles mirroring mistrust-to-clarity arc; final image of whispers as harmony reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "ambiguously clear" shifts meaning across events. Invites reflection on perspective's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (crystal echoes, hush); voice modulates rhythmically from hush to lifting spirits. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Marco's trembling admission advances plot). No head-hopping; diction POV-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive motifs ("resonant hush," "ambiguously clear") border purposeful but create paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated thawing phrases dull mid-beats); density high otherwise with propulsion. Minor synonym churn on whispers/thaw; no closure artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doodles/lens/forecourt transforms misunderstanding trope into perspective-dependent truth; crystal whispers as eavesdrop tool memorable. Risk in projection revelation pays off organically without gimmickry. Transformation test passes via irreplaceable setting.</comment>
