<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in favoring subtle signs, with curiosity compelling the bell pull over siren protocol; interiority concrete in sensor monitoring but slips into label-speak like "credibly curious nature" without embodied contradiction. Final choice earned via data causality, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: microclimate data accumulates to pattern break at bell pull (DC), reconfiguring warning method with risk cost legible in villagers' response; single scene anchors orientation early, closure on-page with before/after in storm preparation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "wind's soft whisper" and "drop in pressure" selectively filter through Elara's priorities, guiding bell choice; sanctuary and rope constrain decision without overt symbolism. Recurring wind carries chime effectively to charge ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (effective warning) signaled early via protocol vs. curiosity, tightens accumulatively through data shift narrowing siren option; agency in bell pull forecloses noise path with felt risk if unheard, cost visible in calm villager response vs. potential chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from data-to-bell arc, resonating in final hush image; repeated phrasing like "favor listening over noise" borders on explicit statement, diluting subtext without moralizing peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in subtle wind/pressure noticing; rhythmic texture poetic but erodes under repetition. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in final third ("after the glue dried," "solstice hush," "favor listening") create synonym churn and template cadence across ≥3 sentences, dulling closure propulsion; density functional but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siren tester innovating with ancient bell transforms trope via microclimate subtlety; bell pull turn feels inevitable from data pattern, risking quiet failure heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
