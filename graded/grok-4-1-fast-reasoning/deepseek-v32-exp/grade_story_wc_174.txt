<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to explore ethical storytelling roots choices like sketching new script, intensifying post-argument; serenity embodied in absorbing dome's acoustics. But half-lit epiphanies verge on unearned diagnostic labels, tidying internal conflict without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds from argument recall to reversal decision; Charged Poise closure ("ethical storytelling was a journey of constant adjustment") reconfigures stance with adaptation cost legible in "refined" mission and lighter stick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome's meteor hush and echoes constrain reflective choices, enabling serene absorption; story stick handled tactilely charges final image as continuity bridge. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (calligraphic tools amid metallic skin).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustaining ethical puppetry post-ban threat) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via epiphanies to reversal; agency in script sketch forecloses defiant path with adaptation cost felt in "disarm critics while deepening."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of balanced subversion emerges through reversal image (puppet from ashes), but repetitive "half-lit epiphanies" and "ethical storytelling" articulations border on thematic echo, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with serene perceptual signature (hush as meteor, grain of stick); rhythmic texture modulates introspection effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies," "campfire story stick," "reversal") and template cadence in repetitive reflections dull propulsion across story, including final third; synonym churn obscures cause/effect at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dome as crucible for puppet calligrapher's reversal transforms artist-reflection trope; risk in blending gritty bars with urbane serenity heightens stakes organically.</comment>
