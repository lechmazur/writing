<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reach Liam intensifies credibly through draining vitality into weaves, culminating in earned sacrifice at "she stepped into the light, her body dissolving." Contradictory impulses—fear gnawing resolve yet steady hands—act simultaneously under pressure. Interiority particular to weaving memories avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of silence and weaves builds to RR closure: Elara's dissolution sends message with legible cost in "becoming part of the unraveling herself." Single scene anchors orientation early ("forgotten orchard...bamboo forest"); no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo-filtered shafts and skeletal trees constrain weaving against advancing silence, mirroring internal fray via "chill in her bones." Final bloom recharges orchard as living tapestry, charging closure image; sensory hierarchy (visual gloom, tactile threads) purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message across distance) signaled early tightens accumulatively: shuttle passes drain vitality, silence coils loom, forcing sacrifice agency. Cost unmistakable in dissolution; one decisive deepening forecloses return path under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love mending time emerges organically from weaving particulars, not statement; final bead/Liam image offers non-literal resonance reweighting sacrifice without moral. Ambiguity lingers in "stories yet to be told" countering tidy transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in loom/tapestry diction ("jigsaw edges...map of the raveling silence"); rhythmic modulation builds to peak compression at portal flare. No dialogue; purposeful lyric elision taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but repetitive "raveling silence" (4+ echoes) and "stoically sparkling" create minor synonym churn dulling mid-weave momentum. Metaphors coherent (moth/chewing/threads); rhythm varies read-aloud without monotony at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-puzzle-silence transforms time-travel trope via tactile weaves; irreplaceable bead/vines bind premise organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight bloom.</comment>
