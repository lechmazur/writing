<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of serene anger act in scene via controlled pursuit amid fury at cosmic secrets; final acceptance earned by experiment's cost, shown in "peace that held the echoes of his fury." Interiority concrete and particular without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ink pour to observation, culminating in on-page CR ("time slowed not as a physical law, but as a mental clarity") with legible conceptual cost of frustrated acceptance; orientation anchored immediately, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ink vial and stone tablet as micro-settings constrain choice (pour, step into patterns) and charge final image (ink vanishes as he returns); sensory details selective via POV urgency, wind subtly mirrors internal transience at close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock time dilation) signaled early, deepens via agency in ink method and observation under lens, narrowing to subjective realization; cost felt in fading effect and unresolved "why" echoes, charging poise without full resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of subjective time as survival gift emerges organically from ink gateway and landslide observation; final image ("smiled thinly, ready to record... no longer searching") offers resonant CR reweighting pursuit without moral, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in serene, precise noticing ("eyes the color of a winter sky"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in dilation scene, diction biased toward feral discipline without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring mental clarity; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—iridescent drone and vanishing fractals advance multiple layers cleanly in peak ink beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ink-as-temporal-gateway premise synthesizes sci-fi with lyric philosophy via drone mapping, transforming time-dilation trope; risk in ephemeral method pays off inevitably at CR, heightening stakes through transience constraint.</comment>
