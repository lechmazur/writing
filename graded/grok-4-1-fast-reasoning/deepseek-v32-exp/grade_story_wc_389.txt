<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to descend and guide roots in consistent visionary traits, shown through micro-choices like interpreting the unity broadcast, earning her final edge-of-crowd endurance. Interiority concrete via embodied listening ("heart a tuning fork") and contradictory isolation amid compulsion. Flaw of loneliness hones vision without safety-hedging, but emotions occasionally lean performative in prophetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vigil signals to council interpretation to dawn reconciliation, with Charged Poise closure ("no longer lonely but not quite belonging") reweighting stake via felt isolation cost in final image. Mosaic shards (observatory → descent → fray → canopy) taught early by vigil purpose, transitions legible. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Elara, observatory, radio whispers).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains descent choice and charges final gleam as "promise kept," mirroring internal shift; stormlit observatory pressures isolation, sensory hierarchy (rain rivulets, static hiss) POV-biased to signals. Evolving details (slick condensation → cerulean ghosts → makeshift canopy) integrate via action. No white-room; tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide prophet amid variant allegiances) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via descent tightening (wavering loyalties), council broadcast deepening (tide-turning interpretation), forcing unification trade-off. Agency in prophetic speech forecloses division with looming betrayal cost. Final reconfiguration crystallizes stance under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-reconciliation emerges organically from radio shadows motif shifting to dawn whisper, final image ("balanced between ancient shadows and a bright horizon") offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "not quite belonging" embraces ambiguity. Particulars (portico gleam) recharge prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (signal-tuned noticing); voice lyrical-prophetic, rhythmic modulation under descent stress. Minimal dialogue natural ("The prophet rises not from a crown, but from a crackle"), goal-driven. No head-hopping; diction character-specific, prose texture distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density ("symphony of thunder," "tuning fork") in most sentences dulls high-pressure council beat (−0.6); "unfold" loops 5x create template cadence (−0.4). Rhythm varies, density high otherwise; no scaffold in closure image. Read-aloud propulsion strong sans artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio visionary descends to gritty-whimsy prophet rise, transforming isolation trope via signal-shadows premise. Turns (clear voice broadcast) earned from vigil pattern; bold mosaic risk heightens stakes. No template echoes; specific portico irreplaceable.</comment>
