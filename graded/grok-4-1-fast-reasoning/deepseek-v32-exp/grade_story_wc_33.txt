<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but told repetitively without embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses acting in scene; label-speak like "respectfully rebellious" dominates over micro-choices under pressure. Final smile and purpose feel unearned without prior internal struggle. No pivotal flaw at closure but lacks 9+ test of contradictory impulses earning choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: descriptive density builds to drone delivery as Charged Poise closure with felt risk cost in "heart pounding" and "risky but necessary." Orientation anchored immediately in arcade/twilight/Elian. Limited tightening—one beat of drone whirring—but legible before/after reconfiguration without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "blue-tinged shadows deepened" and "brittle hush" filter through Elian's hopeful bias, mirroring internal shift and subtly masking movements to constrain smuggling tactic. Arcade as micro-setting charges final image of "cobalt hues blending into stars." Strong but no 9+ constraint on closure choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smuggling for reconciliation signaled early, but escalation under accumulative lens lacks deepening—one drone arrival without reversal or narrowed options; risk abstract, not viscerally tested on-page. No agency-driven turn foreclosing path with cost at climax. Pressure coheres but static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing divisions emerges organically from particulars like letters and drone, with final "glimmer of progress" as non-literal resonant answer reweighting promise motif. Repetitive "linking absences" borders on statement. Capped by Q4's weak pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with consistent perceptual signature of hopeful reflection amid shadows; rhythmic modulation builds tension to release. No dialogue. Some repetition but voice texture controlled under stress. Capped by global gates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "linking absences," "broken promises," "brittle hush," "foster" across final third dull propulsion and obscure closure image; template cadence in reflective sentences like repeated "He [action/thought]." Density low with redundancies. Artifacts touch ending, disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling sci-fi bottle in border arcade transforms tropes via "thunderstorm" powering communicators. Risky rebellion feels organic. Some generic war division but bold quiet revolution angle. Gates prevent higher band.</comment>
