<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic trait roots motivation in doubt-to-action arc, with embodied resonance during visions compelling sharing; micro-choices like steady hand tracing symbols reveal values under pressure. Final courageous sharing earns change with skepticism's felt cost. Minor slip in over-articulated coexistence epiphany ("skepticism and sympathy could coexist") borders diagnostic speak but doesn't flatten pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tile's chill to glowing visions/transcription, culminating in CR closure ("Elara smiled, knowing she had honored the legacy") reweighting skepticism with legacy cost. Orientation anchors early (tower, whales, project). One tightening via shifting numbers narrows doubt, pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity (salt wind, whale songs, cold tile, humming air) mirrors internal resonance, constraining reflection in open tower. Whales' path aligns patterns, charging final communal image. Body/tile as micro-setting tethers choices; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock tile for reflection solace) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via visions/resonance foreclosing skeptical isolation. Agency in transcription/sharing crystallizes stance; moral calculus (doubts vs. villagers' needs) sharpens peak. Cost legible in risked isolation echoed at dawn sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entanglement theme emerges from tile visions and symphony motif, reweighting premise in final image of shared silence without moral state. Particulars (whales, patterns) yield complexity over platitudes; no sermonizing, ambiguity lingers in coexistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (celestial historian filters folklore poetically); voice texture modulates from skeptical observation to resonant flow. Prose syntax/rhythm reflect mind under resonance (short strokes amid visions). Minimal dialogue natural/implied at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "unheard symphony" (5+ echoes) and paraphrase loops on "reflection"/"patterns" create mild churn, dulling mid-transcription density without full pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., "entangled memories" variants) risks scaffold. Closure image propels cleanly despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic tile, whale paths, memory entanglement transforms folklore tropes into textured CR; tile/whales synthesis feels inevitable, risking poetic mode without gimmick.</comment>
