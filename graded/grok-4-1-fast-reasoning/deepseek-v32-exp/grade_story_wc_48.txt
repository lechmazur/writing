<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through repeated captures against chaos, earning her transformation; embodied emotions peak in tears for mother's hope. Internal conflict shows via steadfastness but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal captures, leaning summative. Final melting of doubt feels earned but not deeply micro-chosen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cameos builds to tapestry-weaving closure (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored early (Elara in nexus with shell). Cost legible in shell cooling and nexus shuddering as "work complete," reconfiguring her stasis with undeniable price of chaos endured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (muffled hush, pulsing mist, salty breeze) filters through watchful POV, constraining glimpses and final raise high. Shell as micro-setting charges closure image, parting mist to starlight path. Evolves causally from thickened to peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect hopes) signaled early, escalates via thickening mist/whisper under accumulative lens, one decisive deepening at final cameo narrows to solemnize-or-lose. Agency in captures forecloses erasure path; cost felt in bulwark will, charging final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving longing against oblivion emerges organically from accumulating cameos to radiant tapestry, protagonist arc inextricable. Final starlight path offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting her creative fear. No moralizing; ambiguity in borrowed dreams lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of sharpened senses piercing gloom; diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating from hush to ablaze spiral. No elision or head-hopping; voice coheres as lucidly watchful texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., shell warms/absorbs per cameo); rhythm varies purposefully, read-aloud propulsive. Minor paraphrase loops in "hope" synonyms and repetitive "solemnize" phrasing across beats, but pattern-taught and non-obscuring. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nexus as hope-void with shell-consecration transforms fantasy tropes via accumulative collecting; risk in lyric density heightens closure resonance. Irreplaceable cameo particulars make reconfigurations inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
