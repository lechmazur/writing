<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in gnawing curiosity intensifies to compel ritual; strength in aligned actions like aligning orrery. Weakness: minimal internal contradiction, with competent execution overshadowing struggle in pivotal ritual beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via key insertion → automaton activation → revelation → ritual; closure as Charged Poise lands with cracking key and stalled automaton as legible cost in final moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating isle and orrery mosaic constrain choices, with stellar alignments guiding orrery adjustments; holographic map charges revelation purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize shadows) signaled early, tightens via awakening link revelation forcing ritual agency; shudder and key warmth make cost felt at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical balance emerges via loop-closing ritual; entity's emergence and shadow return reweight Warping legacy non-literally in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with rune-scholar perceptual bias (tracing symbols, rune chanting); rhythmic prose modulates deliberate pace without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory details into action; minor template repetition of "quietly deliberate" slightly dulls early momentum without obscuring ritual peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spoons-bending reality premise fresh, transformed via rune loops and shadow dimensions; ritual payoff feels inevitable from Warping setup.</comment>
