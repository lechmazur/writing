<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in proof-by-contradiction ploy crumbling via file discoveries; motivation intensifies through embodied tension (trembling fingers on files). Final renunciation of legacy earns closure via prior causal buildup. Minor label-speak in "solemn playfulness" slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: journalist call accumulates to file revelations tightening doubt, culminating in CR closure as Elara fuses nib to tablet for confession—cost legible in "orchestrated the end of one orbit." Orientation anchors early; shards transition cleanly via descent/ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's dome, clouds, and file crypt constrain descent/search and charge final ascent image; smells of "old paper and dust" reflect priorities. Recurring nib as micro-setting evolves tactilely to fusion. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy lies) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via file payoffs/closures narrowing innocence assumption. Agency in random file pull forces trade-off to revelation; cost felt in cycle-break. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration before files.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orbits motif emerges organically from family cycles to reweight via confession image, answering truth-seeking without moralizing. Subtext in nib's legacy shift resonates particular to discoveries. Final keystroke offers non-literal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with observant perceptual bias (scrutinizing labels, proofs); diction/rhythm modulate from fury to "solemn playfulness" in keystrokes. Voice texture distinct in logic-tinged interiority. No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in file reveals advances multiple layers; rhythm varies with short ascendant sentences at end. Minor paraphrase in "hidden truth" repeats and "solemn playfulness" x2, but purposeful. No closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh proof-by-contradiction logic on family press empire transforms regret trope; observatory fusion of old/new tech feels organic. Risk in conceptual method pays off at nib-tablet image without gimmick.</comment>
