<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father's legacy of distrust provides consistent motivation that intensifies through story-whispering choices at intersections, earning the final weaving with redemption cost. Interiority concrete via embodied lattice pulse and frayed nerves soothed by copperlight. Contradictory impulses in lies/honesty balance well without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via story-threading amid rising shouts, culminating in RR (wardens dissolve, labyrinth reshapes) with legible cost (bodies found "too late"). Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Single continuous ascent fits scope; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy: copperlight repose soothes nerves, contrasting cold cells, constraining ascent via shifting walls. Lattice shadows dance on walls, charging final beacon image. POV bias filters labyrinth as narrative maze; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach beacon before discovery) signaled early, tightens via lattice shaft reveal amid "shouts echoed... growing closer," forcing story-pouring agency. Escalation textural under lens, narrowing to Charged Poise escape with bodies' cry as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth threading lies emerges organically via whispers shifting walls, resonant in final "hush... of peace" reweighting myths without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; counter-reading (regret's persistence) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct via perceptual signature of pulsing secrets and story-fabric; rhythm modulates from frayed tension to earned calm. Single POV stable, compression purposeful and taught early in lattice-as-compass.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density integrates metaphors (myths breathe) without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("sustains impossibilities") in exposition but not closure; no scaffold in peak beacon beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "boy who cried wolf" into story-labyrinth navigation, with lattice threading as ingenious turn grown from legacy. Risky mythic prison feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
