<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in reluctance shifting to acceptance feels earned through micro-choices like hurried assembly and distant watching; internal conflict embodied in resentment versus stubborn need. Final shift to "quiet acceptance" shows credible endurance with orchard's binding cost legible. Minor abstraction in emotional summary ("graceless beauty of the moment") slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cries → blueprint recall → assembly → projections → escape before frost; single tightening via aggressive birds and warming device narrows options. Closure as RR (Earned Stasis) lands on-page in dismantling and acceptance, with felt cost of perpetual duty in final image. Orientation anchored early in orchard/labyrinth setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds constrain choices (ducking outcrop, timed impressions); "bronze wings whirred with graceless beauty" filters through POV urgency. Recurring orchard nut/device charges final dormant image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under frost pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) signaled early, escalates causally via birds' tightening patrols and device's warmth; agency in projections forecloses capture risk. Cost legible in heart-pounding duck and quickened pace charging final safe whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant duty as "broken, beautiful song" emerges organically from particulars like blueprint's casual precision and final watch; resonant non-literal answer in orchard's shift from chains to song. Avoids moralizing, ambiguity in "unwillingly embraced" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (e.g., "graceless beauty" motif as signature noticing); voice modulates rhythm under stress in short, precise assembly sentences. No dialogue; diction controlled, inference matches knowledge (blueprint recall).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "nut glowed faintly, its core aligning" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops. Minor overwriting in repeated "graceless beauty" risks dilution but ties to tone; clean syntax under peak (bird swoop).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard tech (nut-powered projections) transforms tropes via causal blueprint and frost clock; "offhandedly exact" inflections feel inevitable. Risk in mechanical birds' patrols heightens stakes organically.</comment>
