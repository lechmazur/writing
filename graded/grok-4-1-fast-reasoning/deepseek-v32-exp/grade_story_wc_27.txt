<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to find meaning drives progression to stones, embodied in bare feet sensing vibrations; interiority concrete in visions flash. Weakness: "awkwardly confident" told repetitively without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final purpose solidification feels earned but lacks raw flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from graffiti scan to hum intensification; closure as Charged Poise RR in "reignite action surge through her" with cost of foreclosing violent rebellion path. Orientation anchored early in spaceport bay. Single scene fits defaults, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bare feet on "cool, dusty concrete" and vibrations constrain approach/stepping into circle, charging final glow image. Sensory hierarchy via stargazer noticing graffiti/symbols purposeful. Atmosphere's thunderous serenity mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning/discover reignition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern notice → hum resonance → visions, narrowing to serene power choice. Agency in stepping center forecloses doubt with felt surge cost. Pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of serene renewal from mess emerges via stone hum/images, reweighting rebellion premise in final "wave of serene power" without moralizing. Subtext in grandfather's glasses reprise invites reflection on wonder vs. war. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with stargazer perceptual bias in scanning graffiti/stars. Poetic rhythm modulates to intensity in hum wrapping "like a cocoon of silent thunder." Minor overwriting in elevated diction slightly dulls peak immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing like "awkwardly confident" and "thunderous serenity" creates paraphrase loops; hum descriptions synonym-churn across beats. Metaphor density ("silent thunder," "thunderous serenity") borders muddle in climax without payoff. Propulsion strong early but drags in reflective swells.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient stone circle in sci-fi spaceport transforms rebellion trope to serene energy. Opera glasses for graffiti/stones inflects stargazer uniquely. Risky lyric accumulative drive heightens without gimmick.</comment>
