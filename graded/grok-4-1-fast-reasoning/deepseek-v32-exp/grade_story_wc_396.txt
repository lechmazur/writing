<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaelen's calmly intuitive trait and empathy motivation compel the key choice to free rather than destroy the leviathan, with embodied calm under ice-cracking urgency; minor flaw in lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but past failure adds credible endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anomaly breaks orb's visions therefore seek mirrors, glimpses reconstitute orb therefore reveal leviathan, light frees it with on-page DC closure; orientation anchored early in lighthouse orchard, felt cost in redeemed past failure charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vintage store mirrors constrain reconstitution choice and charge wholeness vision; lighthouse orchard and shifting ice pressure duty from opening groan to closing peace, sensory details (dust, old wood, salt-weathered) filter through Kaelen's intuitive bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save villages from anomaly) tightens via orb reconstitution revealing leviathan, forcing empathy trade-off over destruction; causal escalation narrows options with ice urgency, on-page cost in spiritual alignment visibly paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of spiritual mending via empathy emerges implicitly from mirror glimpses to leviathan soothing; final orb light reconfigures brokenness-to-wholeness without moralizing, resonant in "peace settled over the coast."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (shadows curling, intuitive senses); voice rhythm modulates from calm descent to urgent focus, sparse dialogue natural with subtext in owner's rasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic figures like "shadows curled like smoke" purposeful but dense in store beat slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, strong verbs, rhythm varies to accelerate at cliff's edge resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors reconstituting orb spiritually in ice-fantasy world transforms tropes; leviathan empathy twist inevitable from prior glimpses, risks bold vintage store method without gimmick.</comment>
