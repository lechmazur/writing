<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but passive; recluse's "tranquilly perceptive" trait labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, as in steady observation without internal debate during ghost gathering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to resonant reconfiguration when ghosts fade into "oasis's green embrace," with conceptual cost of preserved silence legible on page; single scene oriented early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stained glass box and phantom hives constrain pivotal choice (opening) and charge final image (cooling, placed on altar); sensory details like "scent of honey and dust" selectively mirror renewal without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken words) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clue-piecing to box-opening; agency in opening forecloses covenant failure with felt cost in ghosts' release and oasis stir.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges implicitly through ghosts' "mute eloquence" and box's "resonant stillness," reweighting covenant in final renewal image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in clue-observation; rhythmic prose modulates from astonishment to peace, consistent diction fits recluse's calm without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on "unspoken words" and "contextual clues" (e.g., repeated in ghost-tending beat) dull density; strong propulsion otherwise, vivid rhythm in climax but template echoes in phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts bound to beekeeping covenant via silence-box; risk in mute resolution transforms post-apocalyptic trope through perceptual accumulation to charged poise.</comment>
