<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in father's flaw, intensifying to decision to teach, but multiple unearned epiphanies like "Elara realized that to widen perspectives responsibly meant..." use diagnostic label-speak without embodied contradiction in micro-choices. Interiority concrete yet repetitive in summarizing paradoxes rather than acting simultaneously under pressure. Father's journal earns a meaningful change, but her endurance lacks visible on-page cost beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrawl interpretations build density to journal discovery as pattern break, tightening to CR closure where extinguishing candle reconfigures rebellion vs. responsibility with conceptual cost of accepting paradoxes. Orientation anchored early (Elara post-heart attack, subways to midsummer library). One meaningful deepening via journal suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: damp paper scent, mica shadows kaleidoscoping stacks mirror fractured quest, constraining wandering to journal find. Library facade gleaming post-rain evolves causally, charging final twilight image. POV bias filters urban scrawls as probabilities; recurring lantern as micro-setting recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (responsible meaning-making vs. father's compulsion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via scrawls to journal deepening that narrows options, forcing stance crystallization in decision to teach. Agency in decoding/traversing shows trade-off; felt emotional cost legible in journal regrets. One tightening sufficient, but abstract stakes viscerally thin until library.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of probability vs. heart emerges organically from journal proofs/bets and final realization, with subtext in scrawls as fate/chance. Resonant non-literal close: lantern extinguishing reweights contradictions without moral state. Repeated "lucid contradictions" borders thematic echo, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: probability lens on scrawls/seats/equations. Voice texture poetic via "stochastic processes," modulating rhythm to introspective cadence. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression in traversal pays off at library.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy loops penalize: "clover melancholy" x4, "lucid contradictions" x3, "rainwashed" x3 create paraphrase churn, dulling closure image of extinguishing candle. Template cadence in repetitive realization sentences ("She felt... She realized... She decided..."); mixed metaphors like "kaleidoscope of shadows mirroring fractured nature." Density good but scaffold drags momentum in ending reflections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gambler-prof's daughter decoding subway graffiti as probabilities transforms trope via mica lantern's equation etchings. Risky poetic voice heightens melancholy-to-hope arc; journal twist earned from scrawls. Non-obvious conceptual close on lived paradoxes inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
