<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via feather's silk vanes sharpening focus; contradictory impulses (painful talents as shield/prison) act in activation beat. Final change earned with cost in "painful remembering softened into acceptance." Minor diagnostic phrasing like "grief into a map of recovery" slightly abstracts peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from nightly substitutions to weeks of seeding, pattern break at pulsing stone. CR closure legible in "glyphs rearranged into an image...with her at its center," cost felt in fading visions replacing clarity "that hurt but healed." Orientation anchored early in seer/bookstore setup; one tightening via feather activation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mercury-glass, stone, feather as micro-settings constrain choices (feather activates glyphs) and charge final image ("feather tucked in her palm"). Sensory selection purposeful: whispers, vibrations mirror inward journey. Labyrinth "breathes" evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of home) signaled early, textural escalation via nightly deepening to thunder's drumbeat forces stance crystallization. Agency in seeding choices forecloses escape path with cost in "substituted realities faded." One tightening at stone discovery narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as nurtured connections via particulars like glyph image reweighting premise. Resonant CR in final bookstore vision answers without moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "stories yet to be seeded." No tidy binaries; earned from struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to textures/sensations (feather vanes, obsidian slab). Rhythm modulates with intensity; purposeful compression in time elision legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies naturally in activation beat ("pressed it to the stone, and the glyphs glowed"). Minor paraphrase loops ("seeding," "buried talents") purposeful as motif but cap propulsion slightly; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: feather-texture activates glyph-stone in mountain bookstore, transforming seer tropes via textural ritual. Risky lyric accumulation heightens inward stakes; final image inevitable from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
