<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via plant telepathy pulling Elara to kite and amplifying unsealing; contradictory impulses in chafing against council while using secret ability resolve in earned sharing. Minor slip in tidy epiphany layering visions without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds from ferns urging kite discovery to decoding/map to unsealing DC (amber cracks, embryo dissolves into visions); cost legible in "not force but understanding" harmony required, reconfiguring options for community. Single tightening at days of cross-referencing suffices; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain navigation (steamy passages, fissure by glowing moss) and charge closure (steam buzzes at gathering); sensory selectivity via plant bias sharpens urgency. Micro-setting of moss/ferns mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition) signaled early, tightens via decoding revealing "implanted destiny" potential, narrowing to resonant unseal by agency; cost felt in stirring dormant consciousness, charging final declaration under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges organically from kite script to visions blending old/new ways; final image of ferns sighing offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with plant-biased perceptual signature (whispers clear as words); voice modulates rhythm in steamy urgency, declaration carries subtext of catalysis over dictate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loop in repeated plant signals ("trembled... hummed... sang... rustled") dulls one peak beat slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic grandma decoding kite to genetic embryo destiny transforms tropes; risk in plant consciousness as bridge heightens stakes organically to charged poise at community shift.</comment>
