<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to decode belonging drives consistent drone guidance and lever pull; embodied pull and frustration add specificity. Perpetual surprise trait told repeatedly without constraining a costly choice, limiting internal conflict depth. Final awe feels earned but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: drone scan builds to garbled data, recalibration, star cluster alignment, dome rotation, and resonant decoding closure as Charged Poise with inner reconfiguration cost. Orientation anchored early via Kael at observatory post-pilgrim. Single scene coherent, one tightening via lever decisive without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's lever, dome, and stone floor constrain lever-pull choice and charge final humming vibration image. Dusk's brilliant dimness motif filters perception purposefully, evolving tactilely with starlight prism. Sensory selection sharpens under drone urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early tightens accumulatively via garbled chip to cluster find, forcing recalibration and lever agency. Lever pull forecloses failed paths with time/frustration cost, charging final belonging resonance. Pilgrim coincidence complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Belonging theme emerges via missing pieces filling, but pilgrim's final whisper ("You have decoded... found what was always there") articulates thesis directly, replacing image pressure. Resonance from matrix chip reprise weakened by overt moralizing. Complexity lingers obliquely in ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: sharp eyes track drone feed biased toward anomalies. Voice texture modulates rhythmically from alert curiosity to awe, with poetic dimness consistent. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ending paraphrase loops ("felt whole... anchored... belonging... woven... promise") create synonym churn across 8+ lines, dulling closure propulsion (−1.2). Motif repetition (brilliant dimness, star trails) purposeful but template cadence in descriptions ("sharp eyes tracked... scanned"). Density good mid-scene, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drone in ancient observatory synthesizing sci-fi relic (matrix chip) with mystic frequency transforms tropes organically. Lever pull turn fresh via stellar alignment. No close template echoes; bold mystic-tech blend heightens stakes authentically.</comment>
