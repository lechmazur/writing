<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's ethically playful irony in "cruel poetry of the dilemma" reveals contradictory impulses acting in the choice beat, earning the sacrificial closure with visible memory cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from rope-tracing to spiral-weaving; CR closure lands on-page as "empty of his past but full," with undeniable cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls and rope constrain the ritual choice, glowing in closure to charge the textured-time realization; sensory selectivity (warm walls, cold stars) mirrors internal layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively from pattern-seeking to "impossible choice" trade-off, with agency in weaving foreclosing past via on-page erasure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final tapestry image resonantly reweights binds/releases premise without moralizing, emerging from rope/beings syncopation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in "gritty and resistant like unpolished clay"; rhythmic modulation sustains subtlety under sacrificial pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images without loops; minor elevated diction fits poet voice, though slight overwrite in patterns risks minor drag before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of poet's rope-ritual freeing pained energy beings transforms sacrifice trope, with patterns risking stakes ingeniously.</comment>
