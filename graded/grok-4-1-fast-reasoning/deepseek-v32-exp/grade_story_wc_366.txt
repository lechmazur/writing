<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's reticent, warmly observant traits root motivation to restore safety, driving micro-choices like cairn-building and sea glass placement; earned endurance against chill shows contradiction without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying chill and light motifs to Charged Poise closure ("lamp blazed... haunting presence recede"); cairn and letters provide motivated ellipsis with persistent ache as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sea glass and lantern room constrain relighting choice and charge final image ("caught the first ray... gleaming"); selective sensory hierarchy (cold wall, spectral chill) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect channel deepens accumulatively via chill intensification forcing cairn/relighting agency; cost unmistakable in "persistent, defiant glow" holding ache at bay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vigilance-through-chain theme emerges organically from letters/cairn/light triumph, reweighted non-literally in "sea glass... gleaming with... internal light" answering fear's premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (textures like "milky... polish"); lyrical rhythm modulates pressure without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in image-propelled lines ("luminescent ache... tangible sorrow"); varied rhythm avoids loops, propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh stone-message/cairn synthesis transforms haunted-lighthouse trope; letter chain inflects vigilance ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
