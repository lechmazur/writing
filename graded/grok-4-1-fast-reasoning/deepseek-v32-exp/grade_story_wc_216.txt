<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in consistent traits intensifies to compel the partnership choice; interiority concrete via urn handling and silo hum. Earned change from solitude to shared work with felt cost. Minor slip: abstract epiphanies like "time not as a river, but as a tapestry" border unearned without more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from rediscovery to stranger's arrival, culminating in CR closure ("time's texture was not in its measure, but in its experience") with conceptual cost of redefined reality legible on page. Orientation anchored early (emerald silo, post-Shift). One tightening via Leo's phrase reweights stake; soft causality in convenient arrival contained by lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo's verdant metal hum and labyrinth constrain solitude, charge final sanctuary image; recurring green evokes growth amid decay. Sensory selective (light through green metal, rain sound) mirrors internal shift. Urgency narrows to urn fragment in timeless moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via embedding method drawing Leo, narrowing isolation. Agency in cryptic descriptions forces partnership; cost felt in foreclosed solitude. Escalation mild—one reversal (stranger's recognition)—abstract stakes viscerally underdelivered until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as experiential tapestry emerges organically from urn equation and timeless pause, resonant non-literal answer in final image ("every ending held a beginning"). Complexity lingers in post-Shift rupture without tidy moral. Minor pseudo-profundity in "melody" rephrase contained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (time's weave/pull); voice poetic, rhythmic under realization pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The numbers lied, but the ashes remember") advances plot. Cross-cap from Q7 debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("anticipated mysteries" x2, repeated time texture/melody/ tapestry variants across final third) and synonym churn dull closure image; template cadence in summary beats ("She now understood... She realized..."). Overwriting with stacked metaphors in realizations obscures propulsion. Heavy artifacts disallow 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Shift time rupture, garage-sale codes, urn equation transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically. Urn fragment reprise inevitable in hindsight, no close echoes.</comment>
