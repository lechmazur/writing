<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's observant trait and ghost-seeing gift drive consistent micro-choices like dust analysis and ceiling climb; motivation intensifies credibly to promise-keeping closure, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal ghost engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (dust→barrel→ghost→ledgers→stories) tighten density toward Resonant Reconfiguration; ghosts' fading and buzz return mark on-page closure with legible emotional cost in lighter burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dust patterns and ceiling crack constrain key choices like compartment reveal and ladder climb; final ceiling glance charges closure image, with sensory shift from buzz to silence mirroring progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering ceilings/ghosts deepens accumulatively via multiplying spirits and pieced stories, forcing endurance; visible cost in hours spent and promise paid charges final pride without agency loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending hidden pasts emerges via particulars like barrel and ledgers; final drive-away image resonantly reweights gift from burden to pride, though "weightless burden" repetition borders on overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Leo's perceptual bias on dust/ceilings; voice texture consistent but minor repetition (e.g., "weightless burden") dulls under pressure; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("weightless burden," "cracks in the façade") creates paraphrase loops in final third, dulling closure propulsion; density functional but scaffold drags rhythm in reflective ending litany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing repairman using dust forensics in circus office transforms tropes organically; ceiling motif's non-obvious payoff in ghost peace feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
