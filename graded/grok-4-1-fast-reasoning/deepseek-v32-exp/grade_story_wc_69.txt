<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to braid voices roots consistently in her past unlearning, embodied in her sigh and finger-tracing; internal conflict subtle in resignation amid urgency. Change earned as choir shifts from fidgeting to harmony. Minor slip: epiphany on reconciliation feels slightly over-tidy without deeper contradiction at pivotal teaching moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from library search to choral harmony. Orientation anchored early in velvet library autumn. Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with felt cost of "ongoing work" in final image; two shards transition legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Autumn light gilding dust motes and oak chest constrain search choice; rosette's honeyed glow charges final piano image. Sensory hierarchy musical/POV-specific; velvet nap tactilely mirrors lullaby harmony. Evolves coherently to hall without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony via subtraction) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rosette discovery to choir's tentative-then-confident singing. Agency in teaching forecloses discord path with ongoing cost legible at "not perfect, but honest." One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of diversity-braided harmony emerges organically from rosette patterns to final chord, reweighting hatred's noise without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in choir mosaic resonating through room. Complexity lingers in "ongoing work" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (percussion leaves, braided voices) stable in third-limited POV; rhythm modulates from hushed library to resonant hall. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in "This denotes the heart." No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., crimson leaves as percussion advances atmosphere/motif); rhythm varies read-aloud. Patterned repetition ("traveled stillness") motif-taught without loop drag. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors dulls one search beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choir as unlearning hatred's crucible, rosette transforming musical trope into reconciliation symbol. Risk in lyric accumulative design heightens quiet closure without gimmick. Minor template inspirational arc familiarity tempers peak.</comment>
