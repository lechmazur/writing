<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("deep, aching pull") and micro-choice progression to gripping pendant compel the final acceptance; minor label-speak ("dimensionally homesick") abstracts some interior contradiction without fully dramatized impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via repeated motifs to CR closure ("home was now the uncertainty itself"); cost legible in pendant shatter and garden's internalization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist constrain perception and choices ("patterns in the ice, glyphs"); pendant as recurring micro-object charges final merger image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty) tightens accumulatively via pendant hum and thinning boundaries, forcing step into between with visible cost (shatter, abandonment); minor abstractness in early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from interiorizing repetitions, resonant in final oneness ("all as one") reweighting homesickness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (dimensional longing filtering mist/light); rhythmic repetition taught early enhances foggy lucidity payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition ("It waited," "through the veil") builds lyric density without loops obscuring closure; minor paraphrase echoes (e.g., mist parting variations) in mid-section slightly dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library guardian trope with dimensional interiorizing and uncertainty-friendship arc feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
