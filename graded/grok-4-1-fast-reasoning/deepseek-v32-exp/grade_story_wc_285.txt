<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between regret and resolve act simultaneously through embodied needle-tracing and memory percolation; final self-forgiveness earned by causality of waiting and ticking silence, foreclosing guilt path with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory density tightens to CR closure at "last tick echoed and faded," reconfiguring promise with legible conceptual cost of scraped layers; single scene oriented early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>River currents and ticking gutters constrain waiting choice and mirror time flow; yarn needle as micro-setting charges final image, with fog muffling enabling reflection pocket.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Percolating memories deepen dominant stake of distillation, narrowing to stance crystallization under accumulative lens; cost felt in "layers of failures" confronting solitude, charging final resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palimpsest evolves organically from guilt to "tapestry of growth" via needle reprise, offering non-literal resonant answer to promise's core question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via ambient cues and selective fog/river noticing; rhythmic modulation builds reflective intensity without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Purposeful "percolate" repetition teaches accumulative texture, but minor paraphrase loops in adjacent reflection lines ("percolate through his mind... continued to percolate") dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Palimpsest promise synthesized with yarn needle mending transforms waiting trope into fresh introspective arc, inevitable in hindsight via ticking payoff.</comment>
