<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's socially perceptive trait shines in responding to the woman's sharp voice without looking up, compelling her mandala work as a micro-choice that reveals whimsical resolve under communal pressure. Minimal internal contradiction limits deeper simultaneity of impulses. Earned change in her carrying meaning forward feels credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from whispers to emergent hush as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting Unlearning from dread to possibility. Orientation anchors early in grotto during Unlearning. Closure cost legible in group's faltering whispers and held breath, foreclosing fearful stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustics amplify whispers and tile flake pulses to constrain Elara's interjection, charging the final hush image. Lilac mist evolves from unease to clarity, mirroring internal shift tactilely through damp rock and sand. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch per her artistic focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess) tightens via woman's criticism as pattern break, forcing mandala deepening that narrows dread options under Accumulative lens. Cost felt in hush's profound quiet replacing anxiety. Single reversal suffices but lacks sharper agency trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mandala's chaotic connections emerge as resonant answer to mess-without-meaning, reweighting premise via final image of blurring sand without moralizing. Theme arises organically from particulars like tile flake's hum. Lingering ambiguity in temporary lesson invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature in chalky hands and swirling patterns. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, woman's line pursuing despair goal. Rhythm modulates to hush cadence without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with sand rustle and hush propulsion; density high in integrated sensory lines. Minor lilac/mist repetition purposeful for tone, but paraphrase loops like "lilac unease" to "lavender clarity" slightly dull peak. No scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unlearning premise and mandala hush synthesis transform anxiety tropes via acoustic mandala ingenuity, risking quiet closure that heightens thematic stakes. Fresh inflections like tile flake reprise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
