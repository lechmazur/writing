<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic traits drive persistence despite doubt, embodied in somatic recall of Mara's hand; final action to show her the art earns change with cost of her illness. Minor slip in alternating summary of skepticism rather than simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density layers to Charged Poise closure in captured image; cost legible in "time was short" and packed geode. Orientation anchored early in studio post-shock; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Studio, LED wand, camera, and geode constrain light-painting choices, mirroring neural paths; body as micro-setting via somatic markers charges final image. Sensory selection (tingling skin, refracted light) purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate Mara's pathways) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through somatic deepening and light sweeps narrowing to artwork; agency in devising sequence forecloses doubt with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of skeptical hope emerges organically from geode/memory/light parallels; final image offers resonant CR repricing doubt without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing geode implies fragile bridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with somatic perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation builds to dance-like intensity. No dialogue; compression of recall legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "fractally precise" and "illuminated hidden pathways" (twice close) dull density (-0.5); solid propulsion otherwise, but minor synonym churn in somatic markers. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting, somatic recall, and geode transforms memory trope; risk in fractal/neural mapping heightens stakes organically.</comment>
