<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in reflective traits, intensifying through gear insight to compel reassembly; actions align precisely with curiosity. Interiority concrete via hands' grace and mental mapping, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no blind spots drive compounding mistakes before success. Felt endurance in storing for future carries minor cost, scaled appropriately.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via timed observations to afternoon realization tightening stake; closure as Conceptual Repricing in "echoes are not just sounds, but memories of space" reconfigures premise with preservation cost. Orientation anchored early (Elian in cavern, wounded season). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble cavern specifics (smooth walls humming, light-shifted angles) constrain echo study and charge final guardian image; sensory hierarchy via sound/light filters through Elian's acoustic priorities. Atmosphere tensions hush vs. potential, mirroring internal pursuit. No white-room; evolves with dusk mournfulness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest/store echoes) signaled early, tightens via gear insight narrowing to synchronization under textural lens; agency in reassembling forecloses scattered sounds path. Visible cost in weeks of testing alters tactics to pulse success. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (reason keepers wonder) emerges from particulars like crystalline vessels, resonant in final "bridge between ephemeral and eternal" reweighting without moral. Subtext in wounded season healing vs. stored aches invites ambiguity. No sermonizing; arc inextricable from pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (peripheral gaze, acoustic bias); voice texture in rhythmic prose ("echoes bounced off marble surfaces as light shifted") modulates subtly with insight. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction fits reflective lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short dawn notes vs. flowing reassembly); density high, sentences advance via image/action. Minor paraphrase loops ("wounded season" reprise x3) and synonym churn (echoes/reflections) dull mid-section slightly but spare closure. No heavy artifacts; read-aloud propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith craft harvesting "echoes as memories of space" via angles/timer feels inevitable; transforms trope of fixer into conceptual guardian. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
