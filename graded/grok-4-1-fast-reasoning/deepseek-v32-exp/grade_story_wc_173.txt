<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to defy conformity roots choices consistently, intensifying to final thread pull, but interiority leans abstract-poetic over embodied contradictions, diluting peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes gather causally to sanctuary materialization as RR closure with unmooring cost legible in "risk everything"; orientation anchors early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snowy courtyard and starlight constrain tracing/untangling actions and charge final cascade image, with sensory details (chimes, shadows) evolving purposefully through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock via echoes) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to final resistant thread narrowing options; agency in untangling forecloses conformity path with felt risk cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embodied defiance emerges organically from thread-harvest particulars, resonant in sanctuary integration reweighting lullaby without statement; final image answers question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature biasing toward grace/rhythms; voice modulates intensity via syntax compression at climax, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High figurative density muddles high-pressure untangling beat without variation payoff (−0.6); minor paraphrase loops in "serenity" motifs and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan mysticism via echo-harvest transforms trope organically; risk in bodily-poetic revolution heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at thread climax.</comment>
