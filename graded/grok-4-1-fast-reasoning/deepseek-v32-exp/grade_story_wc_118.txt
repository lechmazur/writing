<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's sensitively perceptive nature roots motivation in sacred duty, shown through tracing tapestry and activating device. Interiority concrete in wall resonances but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance of eternal hush feels earned with visible cost in no new dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from probing fireplace to device hum, landing Charged Poise closure as stories flow and axis realigns perceptually. Orientation anchored early in silo library post-dream. Cost legible in "eternal hush" against restored whispers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo with heat-cracked stones and murmuring walls constrains choices (probing fireplace yields diaries/tapestry). Sensory hierarchy (bronze quiet, brittle pages) reflects perceptual bias. Fireplace shadows charge final image of mended rift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect wall stories to mend displacement) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tapestry decode to device activation narrowing dream-loss options. Agency in calibration forces stance crystallization. Felt cost undeniable in "no new dreams would come."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory mending cosmological rift emerges organically from wall echoes, diaries, dragons as celestial symbols. Final image reconfigures premise: old dreams live despite hush. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like glowing tapestry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (cloth as "resonance of lost epochs"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compression taught early pays off in closure hum. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in discoveries); density high, metaphors purposeful (dragons "stirring as if alive"). Minor "probe" repetition and "bronze quiet" patterning purposeful, not looping. No scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-dream silo where walls hold stories, displaced axis as dream-severing cataclysm, tapestry-map decoding risks bold perceptual realignment. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
