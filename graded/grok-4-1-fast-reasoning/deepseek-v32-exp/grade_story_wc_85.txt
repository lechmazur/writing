<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between fabricating lies and seeking truth, embodied in clutching the watch hand; final renunciation earned via carving discovery with felt cost of carrying silence. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("guilt that twisted her insides") borders therapy-speak but anchors to present object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from terrace to shore sifting, culminating in on-page CR at carving reveal ("withheld truth finally surfaced... weight crashed down") with legible emotional cost stealing breath; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single-shard coherence intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings and damp sand constrain search and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (cool metal, sieved hush) mirrors guilt via tactile discovery, evolving causally from overgrown path to clutched relic. Cobalt terrace bookends as prison-to-reflection micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quell guilt via truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through sifting beats to knowledge-deepening climax at carving; agency in descent and tracing grooves forecloses denial with on-page cost of breath-stealing realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of withheld truths vs. carried silences emerges organically from watch hand/carving particulars, resonant CR in final acceptance ("some silences could never be broken, only carried") reweighting fabrication premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of guilt-filtered noticing (e.g., "pulse with silent accusation"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, purposeful poetic compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in shore beats; minor overwrite in metaphors ("tide of remorse," "core of tempered regret") during peak but pattern-taught; slight "weight" synonym churn thematic, not looping to obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of black-market genealogy fabricating ancestries transforms guilt trope via driftwood method and sieved hush texture; carving turn inevitable from prior particulars, bold solo interior risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
