<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to shape dawn via shadows intensifies credibly through embodied laughter and visions, with contradictory embrace of destruction/hope acting in adjustments; earned endurance at storm peak forecloses loss with felt cost. Minor slip in label-only phrasing like "shadowed elation" repeated without deeper embodiment slightly dulls interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine builds density to Charged Poise RR closure in final image of poised world/transformation promise, with conceptual cost of loss undeniable in "path to renewal was fraught with loss." One tightening via intensifying visions suffices; orientation anchored immediately in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (echoing footsteps, humming wick, howling wind) filters through Kael's herald priorities, constraining choices via prisms/lenses; lighthouse repository charges final image as conduit for shadows/narratives. Micro-setting of wick/stairs evolves tactilely without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn amid storm) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via prophetic visions narrowing to renewal-after-chaos knowledge; agency in steering adjustments forces trade-off endurance with legible cost in "cleanse as much as it destroyed." Pressure coheres to charged final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-preceding-creation emerges organically from light/shadow interplay and prophetic patterns, reweighted non-literally in final "world felt poised on the edge of something new." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in thunderous laughter and future-glimpses; rhythmic modulation under storm stress purposeful. Capped by Q7 line debt; minor repetition borders uniform tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("otherworldly routine," "shadowed elation," "accidentally prophetic," "total internal reflection," "steer the light" all repeated 2-4x without pressure advance) and template cadence in stacked descriptives (e.g., final third: wick flares/glows/hums/pulses) create synonym churn dulling closure image. Overwriting with redundant motifs obscures propulsion; −1.8 accumulation for artifacts touching peak/ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herald routine as prophetic light-bending post-newspaper era transforms lighthouse trope via glass wick/shadows; risk in lyric accumulative build heightens stakes to conceptual poise without gimmickry.</comment>
