<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through psychometric visions, compelling her to conduit role; interiority concrete via spatial perceptions like "nexus of intersecting light paths." Lacks deeper contradictory impulses in peak vision—embodied but not conflicted enough for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from touch to vision incubation to CR closure where she transfers love's burden, reweighting her purpose with conceptual cost ("balance of things"); orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projection booth as "reliquary" with "dust-moted silence" selectively mirrors internal emotional geography, constraining her solitary reading; recurring crystal neck glow charges final resolve without overt symbolism. Environment shapes vision navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, texturally deepens via crystalline letters vision narrowing to "path clear"; agency in incubation forecloses search with her new guardian cost legible in promise to unheard goodbyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stored love's geography emerges via crystals/letters shifting from abandoned to reclaimable; final image ("seed of future connection") non-literally answers without moralizing, recharging particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual signature ("spatially imaginative mind perceived the room not as a cramped box"); rhythmic modulation in vision builds lyric intensity without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("hushed thunder" x5, "forgotten lyrics" x3, "spatial" variants) create paraphrase churn in vision/ending, dulling propulsion; mixed metaphors (serpent, reliquary, thunder) lack pattern payoff, obscuring closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, film relic, and emotional cartography transforms crystal-gazer trope; risk in nebulous realm navigation heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
