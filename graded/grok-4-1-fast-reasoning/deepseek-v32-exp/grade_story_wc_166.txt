<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to defy ban via verse clear and intensifies through ritual; embodied agony ("agonizing yet exquisite") earns transformation with cost, but final epiphanies like "exile was no longer a punishment but a purpose" feel diagnostic rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from dance to etching as DC; orientation anchors early (Elara in twilight garden post-ban); legible cost in "surge of power" and collapse reconfigures exile into purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Starry gaps and damp grass constrain ritual observation and charge final verse image; sensory details (rustle of leaves, humming air) selective and POV-biased toward celestial voids.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to etch verse tightens accumulatively via intensifying dance and agonizing surge; agency in summoning dust forecloses safe exile with embodied cost on collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia defiance emerges via ritual bridging cosmos and flesh; final image of pulsing verse reweights ban's premise without moralizing, though ending realizations border explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with cosmic perceptual signature ("obsidian grace," celestial focus); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites peak ("lines of silver light tracing across her forearm") without payoff; repetitive phrasing ("obsidian grace" x3, exile loops) creates paraphrase drag dulling late propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic verse on skin post-nostalgia ban synthesizes fresh premise; tide dance transforms exile trope into inevitable rebellion charging closure.</comment>
