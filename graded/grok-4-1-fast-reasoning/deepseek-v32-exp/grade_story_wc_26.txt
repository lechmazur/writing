<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope drives concrete micro-choices like laying the stone on the console; interior conflict peaks in the "luminous regret" realization, embodying contradictory impulses with visible cost in clutching the stone. Final endurance of smoothed hope feels earned by prior observation under pressure. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from comparison to transformation; on-page CR closure in "some transformations come with the cost of forgetting," reweighting hope's premise with conceptual cost legible in the final starlit image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>River stone and luminous screen constrain choices (initiating process) and charge final image; blooming library responds tactilely ("petals of light unfolding"), mirroring internal states through POV-filtered observation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her sharp-eyed role without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope from shadow) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via anomaly spotting to bold transformation; agency in theorized process forecloses raw pain path with on-page cost in "less true" dreams. Pressure coheres to charged final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hope's preservation vs. authenticity emerges from particulars like muting colors and softened shadow; final image non-literally answers by reweighting transformation's premise—"saved hope, but... still be called hope"—with lingering ambiguity and conceptual cost. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in subtle twilight shifts and dream patterns; rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical peak ("beautiful, sorrowful light") without slippage. Voice specificity suits observer, prose texture distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("petals of light," "tapestry of reconciled memories") in transformation beat slightly risks overwriting but pattern-taught and supports closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, unbound shadow, and hope's costly reshape feels inevitable; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable river stone reprise transforming tropes organically.</comment>
