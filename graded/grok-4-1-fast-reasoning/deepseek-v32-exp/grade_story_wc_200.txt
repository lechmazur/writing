<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Repetitive labeling of "modestly fearless" dominates without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority is poetic abstraction rather than particular impulses acting in the healing beat; motivation told via summary loops without causal intensification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with orientation anchored early; closure as Charged Poise via soul's dissipation with luminous ache cost legible in final glow; but linkages thin—harp pluck to confession to laugh lacks opposition or motivated ellipsis narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory echoes (whispering walls amplifying laugh) and micro-setting (harp on rock) ground vividly; gorge subtly mirrors release in golden rays; but static repetition ignores causal evolution, weakening lived-in tactile use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal via laughter) signaled early with one tightening (hesitation to chuckle); but no agency-driven reversal or deepening under Accumulative lens—success too frictionless, stakes abstract without foreclosed option or trade-off in pivotal urging moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of laughter transforming sorrow emerges organically from particulars like rain-dance memory shifting to echoed laugh; final image reweights ache as burden/reward; undermined by overt repetitive assertions bordering on moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent poetic texture; dialogue sparse but goal-driven ("Laugh with me") with subtext; perceptual signature poetic but eroded by repetitive syntax lacking distinction under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache") across adjacent lines and final third create template cadence, dulling closure image; overwriting with stacked metaphors in every high-pressure sentence obscures propulsion; heavy artifacts disallow high bands globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harp-distorted confessions and laughter-healing transforms spectral trope organically; risk in poetic repetition heightens tone without gimmickry; but templated echoes reduce to derivative lyric fantasy.</comment>
